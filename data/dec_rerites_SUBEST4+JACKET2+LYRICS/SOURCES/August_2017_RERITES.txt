	 Over the moors: an odour

	 Her smile, a cypress standing within roses upon the sun.

	 You dream this tragic light between minds.

Wabash con anew,

Now Iconographic 

 And supine kingfishers tickle fodder's sea-lice, 
 And the masts run above the pines, 
 And we declare the living fire a marish lyric: 
 And in the burnt mint, we weep. 

 And driving their blinking 
 blue pink, and blue moidores foot flock, 
 
 The ocean stronger burqas the exquisite curls 
 of the clerk's thought, each spark spur, 
  a drunkard's lantern 
    engulfing, silence

 how we tore from life
 translations, and left 
 before any undertaken

 Stunned--then to strengthen

 We are laughing, children and women, 
 and drums and sisters, and rockpile and hands 
 of belugas' nectar, gleaming odors 
 crumpled about bewilderment, a tidal 
 light of fields that wind arranged for the blood.

	A little dark string of poems
	roused acetylene lips,
	 glistened my soiled knees, 
	 slowly in the dark
	 somewhere backward of you

I eat light again and bloom.

Abandoned limbs, promised, others use for yearning. 
 The hearse is thinner, and the last wilderness is here.  
 Departure's doctor whispers anguish to dreams.

 We are at the beginning: surrealism. 
 
 Carpeted forgiveness
 dreams her breeds. 

 Time sends each birth
 heart-sickness and requires
 ascents to camp-life. 

 As she looks for the PIN 
 to her jaws, in the humming 
 Snowflake-diamond-snowflake house, 
 A mineral-swollen window dies.

 burled in earthen feet
 airstream "Cowboys" 
 unwholesome Biloxi summer ash, and 
 mud analogies of intent 

 juddle in the cellar, 
 rage; an inexorable leg

 your mother 
 feeding the dirt
 with a slow cold tongue. 

 and when sorrow splinters, 
 the clay of ecstasy 
 moon-glazed gazes toward Istanbul!

Catastrophe. 

 
 Death dissidents weeping
 take us to the dust,

 Lose the Slow 
 Branches that describe. 
 
 Now indite. Anyone for the chance.
 Letters Pin the sand.

 Quinceañiera, On This Least Day 


 Democracy? No. Generations of justice talk. 
 I want some easy gentleman to suck the exhaust out of me. 
 
 I chase the costly peril of starlet bare statues. 
 Stump the old Bilbea, the typewriter speaking, 
 a harpoon-line of perfect parties piercing a secret past.

 So weep, run, then die!

 Wool divides the deep sea,

 It sets an anchor in the floral trellis. 
	Illuminates time with snow. 
 	Prune-mulches impersonal sweat. 

 Wrathful, it herds lemons  
    into ambiguous compelling floods.

Night poured into destiny's shrunken bucket. 
 The encrusted, cadenced plaything of the disease.

 Locusts among the bushes of the evening.

 Touch, consume, dominate.

 And slip through altitudes, heaving. 
 In the brief black summer sky unseen 
 In the silent length of affinities 
 gut-sifting peremptory repertoires.

 Apertures

 I curved the rooms of blood. 
  Cherubim in Central ceremony's Center, 
  Orestes-like, a plow to practice splinters, 
 and wound each wood, and bring salt into numbed churches, 
	 a secret anvil slavery
	  leaping in an hour of wine.

 so to fathom this 

 where no one may discover 
 where the roof works at the mouth

 and dreary-voiced wheat 
 leaks a bright scar
 
 we'll take the identity of waves 
 momentarily uprooted sweaters 
 
 and the chill of brung-homes coals
 marveling over the question of the midnight

 I thought that nothing thought, 
 my hand  where I had loved you. 
 
 I thought we had died,  
 deeper than the quick. 
  
 Sometimes I saw a Summer, 
 and thought  of everyone. 
 
 In the vein of the hours, 
 prophesying never fading.

 Flesh like a foaming compact nesting
   battered movement to mend a mouth.

 We paid the horizons with flesh, 
   soothed the many-petalled sky. 
  
 I was forgotten.
 I in a pale grave. 
 I shrieking in the water.

A love
  lifted momentarily
   from an avenue 
    of serpents

  Blue, the table, 
  the milk, on the pock-marked 
     telephone. 
 
 Now my mother, afraid of holding air 
   in her arms, stops the silence
      ringing in her mouth.

 Four bones kept me heavily dead.


 A secret, not meticulously,

 A serious heart

  secret light of the earth. 
 
 Our shadows lift
  the black brow 
  of branches, 
  swinging forever.

 Lifted in heartbeats or unhappiness, 
    desperate windows in us 
  Assault sprawled and butchered woods.

SO OFTEN MOCK-HORMONAL -- 

 
 Clouded as a wire. hand-painted, 
  bars on which the strokes 
  of the arcing walls of tombstones gape: 
 
 We are pain, 
  coleslaw, moon apple 
  media whims, and white-washed
  stares, perched in a fresco.

 Everyone is gone,
       rendering love 
    in the sun's spires

       so calm and dangerous, 
     their forests pure and correct 
 their memory corner needles evolving 
      a being real dreamed thought

    before disappearing in a stream 
  of passion: wounded muffled light

AND UNKNOWN. 

 In the madhouse 
 he had already frayed the lobster 
 wove some intangible beginnings into predictions 
 pictures were made bodies
 and everything, unnamed -- cried:

There we lay; some bedstraps crossing the edge of the sills, 
 shrieks of light costuming the waterfall against the pear.

 We come back into the crusted air, in the grave, 
  laugh in (exhaled, fanatic) 
   moss passion, where skin
    comes to praise.

 It was still comparative

 And I go,
 Ended in the gladness of the soul

 I say that every day is a morning 
   failing, confused and sparse

 I hold sleeping book—word powers; 
 I am a shrimp propellor. 

 And the daisies. 
 I believed I made.

Song of Sex 

 A woman's mouth is

 by the moon that puts her life against the day, 
 walking over old reason toward the dead

 Called for later if we returned

 Lambs in a sky

 Standing in great darkness, 
   hauling the wind, 
 rising, slightly cold

 Rejoicing,    to take away

TO THAT THOUGHT, I JOINED SORROW

 hiding my head over the upper lip of my neck 
 noting no place where thought could tread

 Vernal satisfaction and love.

IN THE NIGHT 

 self-absorption asks: 
	 should I do green? 
	 remember the kitchen scalding blue?
	 buy rubber cigarettes? 
	 double the hands, shrouded up like a tablecloth?

 I was seen dorking racehorses. 
 Teaching stones to sing. Opening 
 Airstreams through the maples. 

 I wanted to 
 whisper. 
 
 I'd give them a feel 
 I was doing nothing.

 Louche mockingbird's heart on the sagging crest:
  so pathetic,

 Laugh to me, my heart 
 Grow on my throne like a stain. 

 Tread the sun with horrible chowder.

MR. BIBLE IS NOT GOOD 

 me, I am better
 me, clean earth 

 Mr Bible married such blessings 
 he loosened chubby silver quarreling. 
 
 I was the black slave plantations 
 where he had Churches and Sawmills.

 I was the target 
 crosshatching on a she-whale's 
 side hit by his harpoon.
 
 And his theft of death into heaven, 
 where death is enervated, I will not tolerate.

 Much like a machine,

 And it is an attribute of honey,

Hot dolphins sack 
 the horizon where men in scorned Infection

This is the journey: spasm scream.

 War smells better. The fallen star,

An underground orchard, clay

 its shadow ripens constellations 
     of foaming tears.

She never puts it in verse: 
       does not embed skin

 She, in self-denial, receives the rats.

 In her wing-burdened arms are mint walls, 
    and mists that sing of plums.

A fear of earth turned back to its heart. 
A machine sleeps there in the bridges it renewed.

	Plutocracy Buffet. 
	 
	 "Metamorphoses?" 
	 Our resentment is here.

	 Waving at the sun, 
	  to take penitence

	  in a gilded bathtub
	  of cold silk 
	  on Facebook.

The light of sound on the body, 
convinced of ashes, in stillness

 choleric mites, and crop green, 
 queries fit to O0000OOOO, 
 falcons to a stratagem.

 I am so bitter. 
 Why must I feel so complete?

 If singing I bring you to be
   unbroidered in an orchard of vagueness

   bringing thrush home with Sappho
   to understand the long-forgotten

Still I lie like a tree 
 where the lone stone light unwrappable 
 counterturns up from your face 

 and the last recycled scrawny texture
 of snow dented spring, the car 

 red clad in rust; turns my weight reading 
 to spare your mastery, plucks a hum 
 directly from the hole.

 Yield to the garden of union 
   murmur an elemental storm

   chrysolite ecstasy
   primeval stain

   hemlock tumult of the self

	   dejected bird

Repent sweetness, 
 peering through the dry splendour

 She appeared in 
 Every thought

 As acoustic chalk: 
  Virgin to the obsession petal



		~ + ~

       

in my head
mud and waves



		~ + ~

    



 Flood-tide at the sea, 
 pealing. Rattles, flames: 

 And you who loomed unhindered flaking 
 in the amber bandages
 of self-inflicted 
 specialized disability
 
 Worthless till 
 proficiency, hobbled near
 a dry reflection of Midsummer 
 calm.

 There is nothing but this forever!

Trade

 The Pains of Weepers
 For Laundry: Deathcolored, White 

 Mouths: faint and interspersed 
 On a nameless Page, Striplings

 Shrieks and swift Ghost Pulse
 Comical vermin sullen Stones.

We are the lure of love

  Anything, even non-placed
  plunging mud. Or a sleep:

     cold and elemental 
     seething in itself





		~ + ~

           


Erase the copse and soar, 
	 but do not go higher than the waves 
	     or stray over the broken orchard 
	  
 Tides strewn with chastity and bones 
 Televisions underfoot, trampling mimesis 
 Reconstructing an unbearable descent

 Stacked and scorched absence,
 Filtered sweat, and choreographed desire.





		~ + ~

                                                                                                                       



	 for the abundance
	  of the hope 
	  of the wind: 

	 yawning, 
	  I focus 
	  on the playground.
