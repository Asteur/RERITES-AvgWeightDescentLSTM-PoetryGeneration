Heaven
 was only half as far that night
at the poetry recital
 listening to the burnt phrases
when I heard the poet have
 a rhyming erection
 then look away with a
 lost look
 ‘Every animal’ he said at last
 ‘After intercourse is sad’
 But the back-row lovers
 looked oblivious
 and glad



 
 The world is a beautiful place
 to be born into
if you don’t mind happiness
 not always being
 so very much fun
 if you don’t mind a touch of hell
 now and then
 just when everything is fine
 because even in heaven
 they don’t sing
 all the time
 The world is a beautiful place
 to be born into
 if you don’t mind some people dying
 all the time
 or maybe only starving
 some of the time
 which isn’t half so bad
 if it isn’t you



Oh the world is a beautiful place
 to be born into
 if you don’t much mind
 a few dead minds
 in the higher places
 or a bomb or two
 now and then
 in your upturned faces
 or such other improprieties
 as our Name Brand society
 is prey to
 with its men of distinction
 and its men of extinction
 and its priests
 and other patrolmen
 and its various segregations
 and congressional investigations
 and other constipations
 that our fool flesh
 is heir to



 Yes the world is the best place of all
 for a lot of such things as
 making the fun scene
 and making the love scene
and making the sad scene
 and singing low songs and having inspirations
 and walking around
 looking at everything
 and smelling flowers
 and goosing statues
 and even thinking
 and kissing people and
 making babies and wearing pants
 and waving hats and
 dancing
 and going swimming in rivers
 on picnics
 in the middle of the summer
 and just generally
 ‘living it up’
 Yes
 but then right in the middle of it
 comes the smiling
 mortician




 Reading Yeats I do not think
 of Ireland
but of midsummer New York
 and of myself back then
 reading that copy I found
 on the Thirdavenue El
 the El
 with its flyhung fans
 and its signs reading
 SPITTING IS FORBIDDEN
 the El
 careening thru its thirdstory world
 with its thirdstory people
 in their thirdstory doors
 looking as if they had never heard
 of the ground
 an old dame
 watering her plant
 or a joker in a straw

 putting a stickpin in his peppermint tie
and looking just like he had nowhere to go
 but coneyisland
 or an undershirted guy
 rocking in his rocker
watching the El pass by
 as if he expected it to be different
 each time
 Reading Yeats I do not think
 of Arcady
and of its woods which Yeats thought dead
 I think instead
 of all the gone faces
 getting off at midtown places
 with their hats and their jobs
 and of that lost book I had
 with its blue cover and its white inside
where a pencilhand had written




HOMECOMING OF LOVE AMONGST ILLUSTRIOUS RUINS
The calcined stones come back.
The fallen temples come back,
The bursted whore houses, the green courtyards
Where the smile of Priapus
Keeps warm the memory of fountains.
My love, let us go along the vanished streets,
Across the bright geometry which still points
To mysterious love and hidden
Pleasures, still so sweet in the night.
Here is the house of the goddess. In the blue
Sanctuary you can still smell the perfume
Of sea foam and jasmine and
Carnations salty with her flesh.
The phallic symbol, jolly as ever,
Riots in the thick foliage — stretched out
On the happy pan of the balance
Which offers it to love. It is heavier
Than all the fruits of the earth.
Aphrodite smiles in the shadows
As she feels the sea throb in her buttocks.


O ancient brightness! O far off light!
Naked light, love, shine on us always.
And when the day comes when we are no more than stones,
After we too, my love, are only ruins,
Let us lie like these stones singing in the sun,
Leading others to love along our vanished ways.


Your womb is smarter than your head,
And as smart as your bottom.
See—
The fierce black grace
Of your naked body.
You are the symbol of the forest,
With your red necklaces,
Your bracelets of curving gold,
And the dark alligator
Swimming in the Zambezi of your eyes.




I remember you as you were that last autumn—
Your grey beret, your calm heart,
And the flames of sunset wrestling in your eyes,
And the leaves falling into the waters of your soul.
You clung to my arm like a vine.
The leaves caught up your slow calm voice—
Vertiginous hearth where my heart blazes—
Sweet blue hyacinth twisting over my soul.
I can feel your eyes, voyaging away, distant as that autumn,
Grey beret, voice of a bird, heart of a huntress—
Where all my deep agony migrated,
Where my happy kisses fell like embers.
The skies from shipboard. Fields from the hills.
Your memory is of light, of smoke, of a still pool.
Deep in your eyes the twilights burned.
The dry leaves of autumn whirled in your soul.

I have shut my windows.
I do not want to hear the weeping.
But from behind the grey walls,
Nothing is heard but the weeping.
There are few angels that sing.
There are few dogs that bark.
A thousand violins fit in the palm of the hand.
But the weeping is an immense angel.
The weeping is an immense dog.
The weeping is an immense violin.
Tears strangle the wind.
Nothing is heard but the weeping.




Facing the palm of fire
Which spreads from the departing sun
Throughout the silent evening—
In this garden of peace—
While flowery Valencia
Drinks the Guadalquiver—
Valencia of slender towers
In the young skies of Ausias March,
Your river changes to roses
At the touch of the sea.
I think of the war. War
Has swept like a tornado
Through the steppes of high Douro,
Through the plains of growing bread,
From fertile Estramadura
To the gardens of lemon trees,
From the grey skies of Asturias
To the marshes of light and salt.
I think that Spain has been sold out,
River by river, mountain by mountain, sea by sea.




Understand that they were sitting just inside the door
At a little table with two full beers and two empties.
There were a few dozen people moving around, killing
Time and getting tight because nothing meant anything
Anymore
Somebody looked at a girl and somebody said
 Great things doing in Spain
But she didn’t even look up, not so much as half an eye.
Then Jack picked up his beer and Nellie her beer
And their legs ground together under the table.
Somebody looked at the clock and somebody said
 Great things doing in Russia
A cop and two whores came in and he bought only two drinks
Because one of them had syphilis
No one knows just why it happened or whether
It would happen ever again on this fretful earth
But Jack picked up his beer again and Nellie her beer again
And, as though at signal, a little man hurried in,
Crossed to the bar and said Hello Steve to the barkeeper.


The Dove walks with sticky feet
Upon the green crowns of the almond tree,
Its feathers smeared over with warmth
Like honey
That dips lazily down into the shadow . . .
Anyone standing in that orchard,
So filled with peace and sleep,
Would hardly have noticed the hill
Nearby
With its three strange wooden arms
Lifted above a throng of motionless people
—Above the helmets of Pilate’s soldiers
Flashing like silver teeth in the sun.
