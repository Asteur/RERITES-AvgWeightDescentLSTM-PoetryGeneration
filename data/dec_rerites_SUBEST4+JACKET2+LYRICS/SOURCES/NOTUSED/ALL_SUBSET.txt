Thy fingers make early flowers of 

all things. 

thy hair mostly the hours love: 

a smoothness which 

sings, saying 

(though love be a day) 

do not fear, we will go amaying. 

thy whitest feet crisply are straying. 

Always 

thy moist eyes are at kisses playing, 

whose strangeness much 

says; singing 

(though love be a day) 

for which girl art thou flowers bringing? 

To be thy lips is a sweet thing 

and small. 

Death, Thee i call rich beyond wishing 

if this thou catch, 

else missing. 

(though love be a day 

and life be nothing, it shall not stop kissing).

All in green went my love riding 
on a great horse of gold 
into the silver dawn. 

four lean hounds crouched low and smiling 
the merry deer ran before. 

Fleeter be they than dappled dreams 
the swift sweet deer 
the red rare deer. 

Four red roebuck at a white water 
the cruel bugle sang before. 

Horn at hip went my love riding 
riding the echo down 
..into the silver dawn. 

four lean hounds crouched low and smiling 
the level meadows ran before. 

Softer be they than slippered sleep 
the lean lithe deer 
the fleet flown deer. 

Four fleet does at a gold valley 
the famished arrow sang before. 

Bow at belt went my love riding 
riding the mountain down 
into the silver dawn. 

four lean hounds crouched low and smiling 
the sheer peaks ran before. 



Paler be they than daunting death 
the sleek slim deer 
the tall tense deer. 

Four tall stags at a green mountain 
the lucky hunter sang before. 

All in green went my love riding 
on a great horse of gold 
into the silver dawn. 

four lean hounds crouched low and smiling 
my heart fell dead before.

when god lets my body be 

From each brave eye shall sprout a tree 
fruit that dangles therefrom 

the purpled world will dance upon 
Between my lips which did sing 

a rose shall beget the spring 

that maidens whom passion wastes 

will lay between their little breasts 
My strong fingers beneath the snow 

Into strenuous birds shall go 
my love walking in the grass 

, their wings will touch with her face 
and all the while shall my heart be 

With the bulge and nuzzle of the sea

the Cambridge ladies who live in furnished souls 

are unbeautiful and have comfortable minds 

(also, with the church's protestant blessings 

daughters, unscented shapeless spirited) 

they believe in Christ and Longfellow, both dead, 

are invariably interested in so many things 

at the present writing one still finds 

delighted fingers knitting for the is it Poles? 

perhaps. While permanent faces coyly bandy 

scandal of Mrs. N and Professor D

Cambridge if sometimes in its box of 

sky lavender and cornerless, the

it may not always be so; and i say 

that if your lips, which i have loved, should touch 

another's, and your dear strong fingers clutch 

his heart, as mine in time not far away; 

if on another's face your sweet hair lay 

in such a silence as i know, or such 

great writhing words as, uttering overmuch, 

stand helplessly before the spirit at bay; 

if this should be, i say if this should be 
you of my heart, send me a little word; 
that i may go unto him, and take his hands, 
saying, Accept all happiness from me. 
Then shall i turn my face, and hear one bird 
sing terribly afar in the lost lands.

suppose 

Life is an old man carrying flowers on his head. 

young death sits in a caf6 

smiling, a piece of money held between 

his thumb and first finger 

(i say "will he buy flowers" to you 
and "Death is young 
life wears velour trousers 
life totters, life has a beard" i 

say to you who are silent. "Do you see 

Life? he is there and here,

asleep, on his head 

flawers, always crying 

to nobody something about les 

roses les bluets 

yes, 

will He buy?

and my love slowly answered I think so. But 
I think I see someone else 

there is a lady, whose name is Afterwards 
she is sitting beside young death, is slender; 
likes flowers.

Spring is like a perhaps hand 

(which comes carefully 

out of No where) arranging 

a window,into which people look (while 

people stare 

arranging and changing placing 

carefully there a strange 

thing and a known thing here) and 

changing everything carefully 

spring is like a perhaps 

Hand in a window 

(carefully to 

and fro moving New and 

Old things,while 

people stare carefully 

moving a perhaps 

fraction of flower here placing 

an inch of air there) and 

without breaking anything. 



 



who knows if the moon's 
a balloon,coming out of a keen city 
in the sky filled with pretty people? 
(and if you and i should 

get into it,if they 

should take me and take you into their balloon, 

why then 

we'd go up higher with all the pretty people 

than houses and steeples and clouds: 
go sailing 

away and away sailing into a keen 
city which nobody's ever visited, where 

always 

it's 

Spring) and everyone's 
in love and flowers pick themselves 



 



i like my body when it is with your 

body. It is so quite new a thing. 

Muscles better and nerves more. 

i like your body, i like what it does, 

i like its hows, i like to feel the spine 

of your body and its bones, and the trembling 

-firm-smooth ness and which i will 

again and again and again 

kiss, i like kissing this and that of you, 

i like, slowly stroking the, shocking fuzz 

of your electric fur, and what-is-it comes 

over parting flesh .... And eyes big love-crumbs, 

and possibly i like the thrill 
of under me you so quite new 





little tree 

little silent Christmas tree 

you are so little 

you are more like a flower 

who found you in the green forest 
and were you very sorry to come away? 
see i will comfort you 
because you smell so sweetly 

i will kiss your cool bark 
and hug you safe and tight 
just as your mother would, 
only don't be afraid 

look the spangles 

that sleep all the year in a dark box 

dreaming of being taken out and allowed to shine, 

the balls the chains red and gold the fluffy threads, 

put up your little arms 

and i'll give them all to you to hold 

every finger shall have its ring 

and there won't be a single place dark or unhappy 

then when you're quite dressed 

you'll stand in the window for everyone to see 

and how they'll stare! 

oh but you'll be very proud 

and my little sister and i will take hands 
and looking up at our beautiful tree 
we'll dance and sing

Humanity i love you 

because you would rather black the boots of 
success than enquire whose soul dangles from his 
watch-chain which would be embarrassing for both 

parties and because you 

unflinchingly applaud all 

songs containing the words country home and 

mother when sung at the old howard 

Humanity i love you because 
when you're hard up you pawn your 
intelligence to buy a drink and when 
you're flush pride keeps 

you from the pawn shop and 
because you are continually committing 
nuisances but more 
especially in your own house 

Humanity i love you because you 
are perpetually putting the secret of 
life in your pants and forgetting 
it's there and sitting down 

on it 

and because you are 

forever making poems in the lap 

of death Humanity 

i hate you

not for philosophy does this rose give a damn . . .

nothing from death" 

you only will create

i sing of Olaf glad and big 

whose warmest heart recoiled at war: 

a conscientious object-or 

his wellbeloved colonel (trig 
westpointer most succinctly bred) 
took erring Olaf soon in hand; 
but though an host of overjoyed 
noncoms( first knocking on the head 
him) do through icy waters roll 
that helplessness which others stroke 
with brushes recently employed 
anent this muddy toiletbowl, 
while kindred intellects evoke 
allegiance per blunt instruments 
Olaf (being to all intents 
a corpse and wanting any rag 
upon what God unto him gave) 
responds,without getting annoyed 
"I will not kiss your f.ing flag" 

straightway the silver bird looked grave 
(departing hurriedly to shave) 

but though all kinds of officers 
(a yearning nation's blueeyed pride) 
their passive prey did kick and curse 
until for wear their clarion 
voices and boots were much the worse, 
and egged the firstclassprivates on 
his rectum wickedly to tease 
by means of skilfully applied 
bayonets roasted hot with heat 
Olaf (upon what were once knees) 
does almost ceaselessly repeat 
"there is some s. I will not eat" 



 



our president,being of which 
assertions duly notified 
threw the yellowsonofabitch 
into a dungeon,where he died 

Christ (of His mercy infinite) 
i pray to see;and Olaf,too 

preponderatingly because 
unless statistics lie he was 
more brave than me: more blond than you. 



 



if there are any heavens my mother will (all by herself )hav<

a clown's smirk in the skull of a baboon 

(where once good lips stalked or eyes firmly stirred) 

my mirror gives me,on this afternoon; 

i am a shape that can but eat and turd 

ere with the dirt death shall him vastly gird, 

a coward waiting clumsily to cease 

whom every perfect thing meanwhile doth miss; 

a hand's impression in an empty glove, 

a soon forgotten tune,a house for lease. 

I have never loved you dear as now i love 

behold this fool who,in the month of June, 

having of certain stars and planets heard, 

rose very slowly in a tight balloon 

until the smallening world became absurd; 

him did an archer spy (whose aim had erred 

never) and by that little trick or this 

he shot the aeronaut down,into the abyss 

and wonderfully i fell through the green groove 

of twilight,striking into many a piece. 

I have never loved you dear as now i love 

god's terrible face,brighter than a spoon, 

collects the image of one fatal word; 

so that my life (which liked the sun and the moon) 

resembles something that has not occurred: 

i am a birdcage without any bird, 

a collar looking for a dog,a kiss 

without lips;a prayer lacking any knees 

but something beats within my shirt to prove 

he is undead who,living,noone is. 

I have never loved you dear as now i love. 



Hell (by most humble me which shall increase) 
open thy fire! for i have had some bliss 
of one small lady upon earth above; 
to whom i cry,remembering her face, 
i have never loved you dear as now i love 



 



if i love You 

(thickness means 

worlds inhabited by roamingly 

stern bright faeries 

if you love 

me) distance is mind carefully 
luminous with innumerable gnomes 
Of complete dream 

if we love each (shyly) 
other, what clouds do or Silently 
Flowers resembles beauty 
less than our breathing 



 



somewhere i have never travelled,gladly beyond 
any experience,your eyes have their silence: 
in your most frail gesture are things which enclose me, 
or which i cannot touch because they are too near 

your slightest look easily will unclose me 

though i have closed myself as fingers, 

you open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens 

(touching skilfully,mysteriously)her first rose 

or if your wish be to close me,i and 
my life will shut very beautifully ,suddenly, 
as when the heart of this flower imagines 
the snow carefully everywhere descending; 

Clothing which we are to perceive in this world equals 
the power of your intense fragility: whose texture 
compels me with the colour of its countries, 
rendering death and forever with each breathing 

(i do not know what it is about you that closes 
and opens;only something in me understands 
the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses) 
nobody ,not even the rain,has such small hands 





but if a living dance upon dead minds 
why,it is love;but at the earliest spear 
of sun perfectly should disappear 
moon's utmost magic,or stones speak or one 
name control more incredible splendor than 
our merely universe,love's also there: 
and being here imprisoned,tortured here 
love everywhere exploding maims and blinds 
(but surely does not forget,perish,sleep 
cannot be photographed,measured;disdains 
the trivial labelling of punctual brains. . . 
Who wields a poem huger than the grave? 
from only Whom shall time no refuge keep

birds who are the secrets of living 
whatever they sing is better than to know

may my mind stroll about hungry

for whenever men are right they are not young 

and may myself do nothing usefully 

and love yourself so more than truly 

there's never been quite such a fool who could fail

you shall above all things be glad and young. 
For if you're young,whatever life you wear

for that way knowledge lies,the foetal grave 
called progress,and negation's dead undoom. 

I'd rather learn from one bird how to sing

anyone lived in a pretty how town 
(with up so floating many bells down) 
spring summer autumn winter 
he sang his didn't he danced his did. 

Women and men(both little and small) 
cared for anyone not at all 
they sowed their isn't they reaped their same 
sun moon stars rain 

children guessed (but only a few 

and down they forgot as up they grew 

autumn winter spring summer) 

that noone loved him more by more 

when by now and tree by leaf 
she laughed his joy she cried his grief 
bird by snow and stir by still 
anyone's any was all to her 

someones married their everyones 
laughed their cryings and did their dance 
(sleep wake hope and then) they 
said their nevers they slept their dream 

stars rain sun moon 

(and only the snow can begin to explain 
how children are apt to forget to remember 
with up so floating many bells down) 

one day anyone died i guess 
(and noone stooped to kiss his face) 
busy folk buried them side by side 
little by little and was by was 



 



all by all and deep by deep 
and more by more they dream their sleep 
noone and anyone earth by april 
wish by spirit and if by yes.

my father moved through dooms of love 
through sames of am through haves of give, 
singing each morning out of each night 
my father moved through depths of height 

this motionless forgetful where 
turned at his glance to shining here; 
that if (so timid air is firm) 
under his eyes would stir and squirm 

newly as from unburied which 
floats the first who,his april touch 
drove sleeping selves to swarm their fates 
woke dreamers to their ghostly roots 

and should some why completely weep 
my father's fingers brought her sleep: 
vainly no smallest voice might cry 
for he could feel the mountains grow. 

Lifting the valleys of the sea 
my father moved through griefs of joy; 
praising a forehead called the moon 
singing desire into begin 

joy was his song and joy so pure 
a heart of star by him could steer 
and pure so now and now so yes 
the wrists of twilight would rejoice 

keen as midsummer's keen beyond 
conceiving mind of sun will stand, 
so strictly (over utmost him 
so hugely) stood my father's dream 



his flesh was flesh his blood was blood: 
no hungry man but wished him food; 
no cripple wouldn't creep one mile 
uphill to only see him smile. 

Scorning the pomp of must and shall 
my father moved through dooms of feel; 
his anger was as right as rain 
his pity was as green as grain 

septembering arms of year extend 
less humbly wealth to foe and friend 
than he to foolish and to wise 
offered immeasurable is 

proudly and (by octobering flame 
beckoned) as earth will downward climb, 
so naked for immortal work 
his shoulders marched against the dark 

his sorrow was as true as bread: 

no liar looked him in the head; 

if every friend became his foe 

he'd laugh and build a world with snow. 

My father moved through theys of we, 
singing each new leaf out of each tree 
(and every child was sure that spring 
danced when she heard my father sing) 

then let men kill which cannot share, 
let blood and flesh be mud and mire, 
scheming imagine,passion willed, 
freedom a drug that's bought and sold 



giving to steal and cruel kind, 
a heart to fear,to doubt a mind, 
to differ a disease of same, 
conform the pinnacle of am 

though dull were all we taste as bright, 
bitter all utterly things sweet, 
maggoty minus and dumb death 
all we inherit,all bequeath 

and nothing quite so least as truth 

i say though hate were why men breathe- 

because my father lived his soul 

love is the whole and more than all

love is the every only god 

who spoke this earth so glad and big 
even a thing all small and sad 
man,may his mighty briefness dig 

for love beginning means return 

seas who could sing so deep and strong 

one queerying wave will whitely yearn . 
from each last shore and home come young 

so truly perfectly the skies 

by merciful love whispered were, 

completes its brightness with your eyes 

any illimitable star 



 



love is more thicker than forget 
more thinner than recall 
more seldom than a wave is wet 
more frequent than to fail 

it is most mad and moonly 
and less it shall unbe 
than all the sea which only 
is deeper than the sea 

love is less always than to win 
less never than alive 
less bigger than the least begin 
less littler than forgive 

it is most sane and sunly 
and more it cannot die 
than all the sky which only 
is higher than the sky 



 



hate blows a bubble of despair into 
hugeness world system universe and bang 
fear buries a tomorrow under woe 
and up comes yesterday most green and young 

pleasure and pain are merely surfaces 
(one itself showing,itself hiding one) 
life's only and true value neither is 
love makes the little thickness of the coin 

comes here a man would have from madame death 
neverless now and without winter spring? 
she'll spin that spirit her own fingers with 
and give him nothing (if he should not sing) 

how much more than enough for both of us 
darling. And if i sing you are my voice, 



 



what freedom's not some under's mere above 
but breathing yes which fear will never no? 
measureless our pure living complete love 
whose doom is beauty and its fate to grow 

shall hate confound the wise? doubt blind the brave? 
does mask wear face? have singings gone to say? 
here youngest selves yet younger selves conceive 
here's music's music and the day of day 

are worlds collapsing? any was a glove 
but i'm and you are actual either hand 
is when for sale? forever is to give 
and on forever's very now we stand 

nor a first rose explodes but shall increase 
whole truthful infinite immediate us 



 



of all the blessings which to man 
kind progress doth impart 
one stands supreme i mean the an 
imal without a heart 

Huge this collective pseudobeast 
(sans either pain or joy) 
does nothing except preexist 
its hoi in its polloi 

and if sometimes he's prodded forth 
to exercise her vote 

(or made by threats of something worth 
than death to change their coat 

which something as you'll never guess 
in fifty thousand years 
equals the quote and unquote loss 
of liberty my dears 

or even is compelled to fight 
itself from tame to teem) 
still doth our hero contemplate 
in raptures of undream 

that strictly (and how)scienti 
fie land of supernod 
where freedom is compulsory 
and only man is god. 

Without a heart the animal 
is very very kind 
so kind it wouldn't like a soul 
and couldn't use a mind

what if a much of a which of a wind

Blow hope to terror;blow seeing to blind

it's they shall cry hello to the spring 

what if a dawn of a doom of a dream 
bites this universe in two, 
peels forever out of his grave 
and sprinkles nowhere with me and you? 
Blow soon to never and never to twice 
(blow life to isn't: blow death to was) 
all nothing's only our hugest home; 
the most who die,the more we live 



 



no man,if men are gods;but if gods must 
be men,the sometimes only man is this 
(most common, for each anguish is his grief; 
and,for his joy is more than joy,most rare) 

a fiend,if fiends speak truth ;if angels burn 

by their own generous completely light, 
an angel;or(as various worlds he'll spurn 
rather than fail immeasurable fate) 
coward,clown,traitor,idiot,dreamer,beast 

such was a poet and shall be and is 

who'll solve the depths of horror to defend 
a sunbeam's architecture with his life: 
and carve immortal jungles of despair 
to hold a mountain's heartbeat in his hand 



 



when god decided to invent 
everything he took one 
breath bigger than a circustent 
and everything began 

-when man determined to destroy 
himself he picked the was 
of shall and finding only why 
smashed it into because

nothing false and possible is love 
(who's imagined,therefore limitless) 
love's to giving as to keeping's give; 
as yes is to if , love is to yes 

must's a schoolroom in the month of may: 
life's the deathboard where all now turns when 
(love's a universe beyond obey 
or command,reality or un-) 

proudly depths above why's first because 
(faith's last doubt and humbly heights below) 
kneeling, we true lovers pray that us 
will ourselves continue to outgrow 

all whose mosts if you have known and i've 
only we our least begin to guess 





except in your 

honour, 

my loveliest, 

nothing 

may move may rest 

you bring 

(out of dark the 
earth) a 
procession of 
wonders 

huger than prove 
our fears 

were hopes: the moon 

open 

for you and close 

will shy 

wings of because; 

each why 

of star (afloat 

on not 

quite less than all 

of time) 

gives you skilful 

his flame 

so is your heart 

alert, 

of languages 

there's none 

but well she knows; 

and can 



perfectly speak 

(snowflake 

and rainbow mind 

and soul 

november and 

april) 

who younger than 

begin 

are,the worlds move 

in your 

(and rest,my love) 

honour 





true lovers in each happening of their hearts 
live longer than all which and every who; 
despite what fear denies,what hope asserts, 
what falsest both disprove by proving true 

(all doubts,all certainties, as villains strive 
and heroes through the mere mind's poor pretend 
grim comics of duration: only love 
immortally occurs beyond the mind) 

such a forever is love's any now 

and her each here is such an everywhere, 

even more true would truest lovers grow 

if out of midnight dropped more suns than are 

(yes;and if time should ask into his was 
all shall,their eyes would never miss a yes)

yes is a pleasant country: 

if s wintry 

(my lovely) 

let's open the year 

both is the very weather 

(not either) 

my treasure, 

when violets appear 

love is a deeper season 

than reason; 

my sweet one

all ignorance toboggans into know 
and trudges up to ignorance again: 
but winter's not forever,even snow 
melts;and if spring should spoil the game,what then? 

all history's a winter sport or three: 
but were it five,i'd still insist that all 
history is too small for even me; 
for me and you,exceedingly too small. 

Swoop(shrill collective myth)into thy grave 
merely to toil the scale to shrillerness 
per every madge and mabel dick and dave 
tomorrow is our permanent address 

and there they'll scarcely find us (if they do, 
we'll move away still further: into now

and dance (and does with each your least 

your any most very amazing now 

or here) let pitiless fear play host 

to every isn't that's under the spring 

but if a look should april me, 

down isn't's own isn't go ghostly they

but if a look should april me 
for half a when, whatever is less 
alive than never begins to yes 

but if a look should april me 

(though such as perfect hope can feel 

only despair completely strikes 

forests of mind,mountains of soul) 

quite at the hugest which of his who 

death is killed dead. Hills jump with brooks: 

trees tumble out of twigs and sticks;

"sweet spring is your

time for springtime is lovetime 

and viva sweet love" 

(all the merry little birds are 
flying in the floating in the 
very spirits singing in 
are winging in the blossoming) 

lovers go and lovers come 
awandering awondering 
but any two are perfectly 
alone there's nobody else alive 

(such a sky and such a sun 
i never knew and neither did you 
and everybody never breathed 
quite so many kinds of yes) 

not a tree can count his leaves 
each herself by opening 
but shining who by thousands mean 
only one amazing thing 

(secretly adoring shyly 
tiny winging darting floating 
merry in the blossoming 
always joyful selves are singing)

we're wonderful one times one 





when serpents bargain for the right to squirm 
and the sun strikes to gain a living wage- 
when thorns regard their roses with alarm 
and rainbows are insured against old age 

when every thrush may sing no new moon in 
if all screech-owls have not okayed his voice 
and any wave signs on the dotted line 
or else an ocean is compelled to close 

when the oak begs permission of the birch 
to make an acornvalleys accuse their

i thank You God for most this amazing 
day: for the leaping greenly spirits of trees 
and a blue true dream of sky;and for everything 
which is natural which is infinite which is yes

now the eyes of my eyes are opened) 



 



the great advantage of being alive 
(instead of undying) is not so much 
that mind no more can disprove than prove 
what heart may feel and soul may touch 
the great (my darling) happens to be 
that love are in we,that love are in we 

and here is a secret they never will share 
for whom create is less than have 
or one times one than when times where 
that we are in love,that we are in love: 
with us they've nothing times nothing to do 
(for love are in we am in i are in you) 

this world(as timorous itsters all 
to call their cowardice quite agree) 
shall never discover our touch and feel 
for love are in we are in love are in we; 
for you are and i am and we are (above 
and under all possible worlds) in love 

a billion brains may coax undeath 
from fancied fact and spaceful time-- 
no heart can leap,no soul can breathe 
but by the sizeless truth of a dream 
whose sleep is the sky and the earth and the sea, 
For love are in you am in i are in we 



 



when faces called flowers float out of the ground 
and breathing is wishing and wishing is having 
but keeping is downward and doubting and never 
it's april(yes,april;my darling) it's spring! 
yes the pretty birds frolic as spry as can fly 
yes the little fish gambol as glad as can be 
(yes the mountains are dancing together) 

when every leaf opens without any sound 
and wishing is having and having is giving 
but keeping is doting and nothing and nonsense 
alive;we're alive,dear:it's(kiss me now)spring! 
now the pretty birds hover so she and so he 
now the little fish quiver so you and so i 
(now the mountains are dancing,the mountains) 

when more than was lost has been found has been found 

and having is giving and giving is living 

but keeping is darkness and winter and cringing 

it's spring (all our night becomes day)o,it's spring!

I Am Leaving — 


 The first prey of feelings 
 is writing. 

 I never keep much. 
 
 Even from within the grave, windows 
 cannot creep over this poem's nest.





	
                                                                                                                       



O Outraged, One 

 the first cascades
 letting in the green 
 gagging, clacking, 
 uncontrollable,
 ash erased flocks -- 

 spin behind cognition, 
 breeze away the join



	
                                                                                                                       
 
 



	 Over the moors: an odour 
	 of common stone in the medial pines.

	 Her smile, a cypress standing within roses upon the sun.

	 You dream this tragic light between minds. 
	 
	 Mute. Transformed 
		 by the fire 
		 in your hand.





	


               



The sheep-hooks, on the wharves, bloodred  
     wisteria, twinkling like eyes. 
 
 The earth is
 slaughter. 
 

 
 

	
                    




 When the intervals of madness 
 will be complete,

 A Sky, long genuine,
 will become the door of my home.
 




	
               




 Under a caked-round sunlight, the waves touch
 Sprawled almost-dark poorhouses, 
 Star-shaped maples, glass-swollen skin.





	
                 



 The top of your cliff 
 Where one chained 
 Form is like love or a bull
 Chiming about power

 Bread passion mystery, 
 mainsails and eucalyptus.




	
                                                                                                                       



Light snowdrifts
  near the depot

                  My tongue tucked in: 
                  keel, lounged. 
 
Wabash con anew, 
 deep horizon, 
 ringed. 


 		          Shockwaves tax-deductible
 		          at the parting. 
 

 Forget muscles 
  and syllables. 


 


	
   




Lilacs 
   dumb and drooping from the soul
     are singers, little messes


 Death's children
  fill my wound 
     like flour




	
        



                                                                                                                       
Me Apricot 

   synthesis 
 means: nourishment, 
    it among you. 





	
        

      

 
 In Kauai Alone 

 
 a film of sinews 
 leached to praise

 the color of chloroformed aspen 
 inside ears of primeval recognition





	
              


Now Iconographic 

 And supine kingfishers tickle fodder's sea-lice, 
 And the masts run above the pines, 
 And we declare the living fire a marish lyric: 
 And in the burnt mint, we weep. 

 And driving their blinking 
 blue pink, and blue moidores foot flock, 
 
 The ocean stronger burqas the exquisite curls 
 of the clerk's thought, each spark spur, 
  a drunkard's lantern 
    engulfing, silence
 
 


	
                                                                                                                       
 
 
 
 I was murdered by 
 a worm in my heart. 
 
 
 

	
                                                                                                                       
 

 
 The smallest embrace. 
 
	 Tunnels strolled in the street.

	 Salty fire, 
	 repetitive vigor, 
	 phones, mercies. 




	



                                                                                                                       
Winds echo forgotten light, 
 breathing on graced water. 

 Love remains set; and the roof, unwoven, 
  stretched and swept up the sky's shoe. 




	
               



Ratified 

 She grunts. And upstairs, the evening’s 
 sticky-fingered storms confuse
  the mirror. 




	
              





Carbon-Coated 

	 We are so beautiful in the whine, 
	  mothered in this dirt body. 
	 
	 Blood kissed wanderers 
	  led into alien gladness. 
	 
	 A lost voice, breathing.





	
                                                                                                                       
 
                                                                                                                       
 
 
 
 
 
 yr Jake 
 
 
 This beach and the sun made its room,
 in your dying trees, inscrutable.







	





                                                                                                                       
Trembling, 

 starry and specific and wonderful, 
 a few faint wisps already had shadows. 
 
 And we are sleeping on the table, 
 while someone bright on the floor, 
 secretes an opening.





	



                                                                                                                       
Mind Slaves. 
 
 The counting place, ashes, birth 
  a self-portrait in meat. 

 Lightning a boundary 
  somebody dreams. 

 Finances, neon bold and benign, 
  flowering in the cold
   chastening cranium. 
 
 



	
                                                                                                                       



Mountains caress
 a silent lamp 
 smeared in the stars' 
 weightless nucleii




	



                                                                                                                       
Nerves
 
 I am, fuck myself, a rimmed,
 crisis-shaved starting-to-rust grave.




	
                                                                                                                       



Arriving bees 
 awaken belief




	
                                                                                                                       




More talk: a closer poetry is closed 
 
 No sweet-breathing joints 
 Slow these ephemeral 
 concession trances
 on the surface 
 of glowing interpetation. 
 


	
                                                                                                                       
 


	 the hickory under 
	 the intervening rain
	 is a flame shrub 

	 nutrient, green, glare




	
                   



Real ledger cataracts
examine the bleeding
    morning:

 yellow safeguard, 
 accident season 
 
 moisture institute,
 bereavement apple. 
 


	
                   


 The dead man used to swim in ponds, 
     squinting at indeterminancy


	
                                                                                                                       
 
    


    unthinkable metaphor

    we made one phrase uneasily 
 follow the wires of this true mystery


 			disassemble the dead-end





	




                                                                                                                       
Say 


 I owned, 
 a tongue

		 Diesel and money,
		 initials, and the clinics of flowers,
		 A lying fatality, the moon,
		 friends, loneliness.

 Unhappy, 
 began to eat.
 





	
                                                                                                                       
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I was a house of anguish
 Foreclosed in my act. 
 All day I appealed.






	
                





In Machines. 

 Schemas move from an old sack.

   A blob, hush-throated 
   nimble, elongated, 
   quick as a sparrow on a ledge,
   grows a kind of killing 
   which longs to live 
   in flesh.

29-07-2017. Morning sun on chair.
=================================



	
   


                                                                                                                       
 I'll be at the window of my tongue 
 and proud of my hunger, waiting for 
 two-hour walls of veined 
 Here, a morning broken,
 insured and cold as sand, 
 impossibility, cancelled.




	
                                                                                                                       




All That Phantom Shuddering

 The last care he tore from 
 bright concrete around my legs, 
  brushed the overhanging desiccated skies 
 until the hunger of horses 
 is his. Bent at last.




	
                 




 So on the bursting knots of the dead, 
 squalled out, thieving beetles,
 bees, indolence platters, and hounds
 dig their mouths into the hollow basket



	
                                                                                                                       
 

        



        Imperfect, 
     I have gained alive, 
       a home. 

  A place within me, where I can 
  tell pain to unlace
   its roots.








	
                                                                                                                       



the belonging of long days, passed to you.

 we forget our eyes 
 where junkyard birds,
 inquisitive, claim 
 the uninitiated.





	



                                                                                                                       
 terrified in my loneliness 
 
I ache in the  confession cage 
 gathering to excavate  glass 



	
        



The rain cooled fell, cold flight — 
 turning at the immortalized, blanched, blossomlike site, 

 the shaking air grieving, the key 
 flying down, hieroglyph 
 god, garlanded with power. 
 


	
                                                                                                                       
 



 how we tore from life
 translations, and left 
 before any undertaken 




	



                                                                                                                       
 Stunned--then to strengthen

 We are laughing, children and women, 
 and drums and sisters, and rockpile and hands 
 of belugas' nectar, gleaming odors 
 crumpled about bewilderment, a tidal 
 light of fields that wind arranged for the blood.





	
          




	A little dark string of poems
	roused acetylene lips,
	 glistened my soiled knees,

 flesh leaning into each door.

 latest disc of unknowables 
 secret Hair growing on the floor

 top-deep like breasts...curious...hungry 
 An Atmosphere turned from Dieu
 



	

                                                                                                                       
 
 We are at the beginning: surrealism. 
 
 Carpeted forgiveness
 dreams her breeds. 

 Time sends each birth
 heart-sickness and requires
 ascents to camp-life. 

 As she looks for the PIN 
 to her jaws, in the humming 
 Snowflake-diamond-snowflake house, 
 A mineral-swollen window dies. 



	

                                                                                                                       
 

 burled in earthen feet
 airstream "Cowboys" 
 unwholesome Biloxi summer ash, and 
 mud analogies of intent 

 juddle in the cellar, 
 rage; an inexorable leg

 your mother 
 feeding the dirt
 with a slow cold tongue. 

 and when sorrow splinters, 
 the clay of ecstasy 
 moon-glazed gazes toward Istanbul! 



	

                                                                                                                       
Catastrophe. 

 
 Death dissidents weeping
 take us to the dust, 
 cut their fingers on Closing-- 

 Lose the Slow 
 Branches that describe. 
 
 Now indite. Anyone for the chance.
 Letters Pin the sand.


	


                                                                                                                       
	 We know their hearts, 
	 and radiantly slept 
	 with meditating Saints

	 That azure evening, 
	 Goldengrove 
	 ethno-centricism,

	 Espresso realized Bells, 
	 Kyonishiki....

Indeed, 

 every salty sullen spirit for its Foe, 
   ends thought and sinks, livid into ice. 
 
 even if you save everything, it is only the rain. 
   like lovers, young phrases.



	


                       
                       extraños

In Ottilie

 Hair spots the rope above her cell. 
 It is what I would do if I was her. 

 The volunteer of fame is supporting 
  breasts rags and chewing the apple

In fields that shift free,
   torn from arterial oak boughs
     we, who do not die, shut 
 your nest, so limestone bread can be 


	

                                                                                                                       
  
 And I thought a Passion sleepy as honey — 
 The inverse shadow of a gift.

 It was a manifold, non-negotiable 
 Complicity rain-fed harvest of newly cold stars.

 In one harrowed
 clowning cruel air is chance

 Then the Soil,  
 The pilot-fish, alleys, 
 the River-dragon quality-God 
 shrill-gorged rest of  
 always-night -- contemplative, 
 subtle and brave

 That instruct him beautiful and whiskey and easy 
 In the sefa, forgot, gowl Playing

 And vague poynt to distance

 Bleating Mistrust,

 that Ends Suddenly

 the Luminous Rose 
 enticed as one

I Simplified 

    the awkward truffle-filled dinner fetlock—bereft

 to play the cyclotron path and state: out of the salutation of affability

 Cherries, Enemies, Stones, Children.

 And drank honey-milk flow-down streets from lovers' hips:
 Supermarkets, Lawns, Ladders.

               As I hurried on, 
            happiness diminished 
         in the screen of the pure-me: 
   a fascist foam of fat stories murdered;
     a prison of sin bent from the whale; 
         a bilious war made to dream.







	





                                                                                                                       
 Quinceañiera, On This Least Day 


 Democracy? No. Generations of justice talk. 
 I want some easy gentleman to suck the exhaust out of me. 
 
 I chase the costly peril of starlet bare statues. 
 Stump the old Bilbea, the typewriter speaking, 
 a harpoon-line of perfect parties piercing a secret past.





	


              

 Look upon the wonder 
     buried within the carrots, and gnarled 
          trees, thunderstorms, and fungus.


				Calm, think, in gusts 
				What is not written.




	



                                                                                                                       
All morning he rolled in
 the leaves. 
 
 A dented flag in his hands
       amid small deceptions
    of a flood-tide, the flecking
       locked world.

 During the Sporadic Barefoot War


       Pain pressed 
   Jealousy to birth
      A toy





	


                                                                                                                       
Wave-Crests 

 
 With wild cheekbones

     shuck the teats

 the scent of empty wonder



	

         

 this floor burns 
  as if to slow
   love


	

      
 


	 We wake, and all 
	  welcome the grace of life:
	 bewildered, easily. 

	 Each change a tyrant grief 
	  that loves its own threads 
	 among the rust. 

	 A dead flower where 
	  the desert caresses 
	 the languid world. 

	 I cannot feel. 
	  What same 
	 it is. 
	 


 Everyone wants money, making it 
  into thin meals, ingesting their love 
 with a few gypsy friends who hate fish.





	

          




       the brave baby 
      hopelessly shamed 
    by an adulterous hate
   burns, joyous and small 
  dangerous as the naked day
        in the ground






	

       


Filth

 It hits the spirit. A high-heeled, 'Yes, 
   credit'. Bruised, slurring. 
 
 Zucchinis and simplicities. Lobsters 
   and darkness. Unplugging 
 the blank-canvas center of "Thee." 




	

          


Forest Hipsters 
Fountain-full

 Born not in grace 
   but unwavering
 ALONE, erratically

 swamp picking thoughts
   from the carcass of a
   wanton heart 




	

                                                                                                                       
 

 The dead man loitering in the dangerous garden 
     glared at the harm of rest 
      floating on the burning sea. 
 


	

                         


       We each discovered a sun. 
  This is the word. A lesson, not 
    a trip of fists. An ironic life.

As she claimed death
 The stars tasted 
 poisonous gold.

 Queer background, XCI 
 Liberation juice

 Marmalade pouting, 
 Nearness exposed. 




	

                                                                                                                       




 The colors of my teeth
	 open houses, 
	 mature, a warm war.





	

    

A storm-light dead calm
   wanders above the dream-color grain. 


	

       

Sea? 

  rend out your graves,
  leave them to splendor

   as if they had phones 
   to paraphrase 
    tracheas



	

                                   



The dead man is caring for the breeze.

  A silent sky of his own tears
      quick as a melody
    worn as a self-satisfied 
     frozen rain into decay 

       All plastic is blue
          Nevermind shed 
           In the Wanted





	


	                                                                                                                       
	Off 

	 
	 I think no one has ever seen
	 the roses darken clouds
	 above the bankrupt summer
	 while in a segregated valley
	   drunk mud hums




	

                                                                                                                       
 
 Swag-bellied auto bone
 Passage to despair! 
 
 No mirror of unity.

zunbrowned 
 riverbank wrinkled
 cloudy ruffled

 And the dead man sees the dune
  and remembers a frosty thread 
  between wet sun and heart

 falling thru emptiness



	

        


I Wonder 

 I am allowed to think of everything 
 I am quarantined and overboard. 
 I know daybreak apple light. 
 I say farewell to lies.
 I am disembodied.

 by swimming color
 how I want you, 
 how i am hurt by the absence of thee!

         and serene
         curl in the garden

         of battered breath



	




 Oh! we bless the dead
 Between the waves

 Sitting in the rooms of ink 
 We scatter black dung 
 
 Open newly darkened syllables 
 On the table of Daddy's candy. 
 
 Ice tattooed in the eyes
 Obscuring the play of curse and eat.

ITS QUIET 

    in the trap of dream: where a girl, 
 mutters in her glass, reading her palm 
 leaning out over ruts of heavy sighs -- 

    flesh: a cell 
 of credulous wooden waves 
  synchronized from debts

 Talk encircling

 Cold novenas

   caresses a spark clear spring

 As we grew capable

 Body—fish-slippery
 laced jail consents.

 Needle proud poison 
 realised tactics wish. 

	 We loved the idea 
	   of something 
	 to snatch spleen. 

 


	

                 


 Lose: all those conjured years
 skim the fender of the logging chemistries


	

       

 Not in Keats signaled
 Yet advertised as morning
 


	

       


We are controlled coffee. Whiskey mutants. 
 We're sunfall and fear of self. 

 And then there's you: sanctity filled with milk, 
 and a long pool of unsuccessful heavens, where it rains. 
 
 


	

                                                                                                                       

 In the blindfold
 no one seems to count the
 smell between pens and peace 
 
 The moon's eyes lifted from the wind. 
 


	




 Our little voice
 in lyric hills
  simply dies. 
 


	

             


 So weep, run, then die!

 Wool divides the deep sea, 
 	roiling fragrant, 
 	growing epiphanies.  
 
 It sets an anchor in the floral trellis. 
	Illuminates time with snow. 
 	Prune-mulches impersonal sweat. 

 Wrathful, it herds lemons  
    into ambiguous compelling floods.





	


                                                                                                                       


I love you, who lost me, 
 in the dead metaphorical
    morbid always.

  looks at all things as shining

		    each

		     stippled

  a madman uncoils a stone
 
    night
   falling thru a horizon
   grazes salty gardens 


	




                                                                                                                       
 Such sinking folk abolished

 O domestic mess
 unused sugar
 watt cord

 pregnant basin, chemical 
 grackle's kisses
 indiana in the mind, 
 the hunger of the sweet forgotten

 and the time of blood
 woven about the sick 
 broken strangers
  bread 





	

            


  In the darkness 
  of the smoothness 
  of the moving earth

 	the Animals are naked. 



	



 They moved into my sleep, and accompanied 
  my murmuring animal's phosphorous breath.

 Tails & light, a gnarled rock. 
 I was happy. There is worse gladness.

 A sudden beautiful blood 
  heart-glued my need 
  to a touch of fruit.



	

         



INVESTMENT WHITTLING 

 A lump of smelted plates 
  in the lair of dead Mnemosyne.

 Begging for the waver of a river-beds 
  that define tears.

 Remember the bronzed inconsequential 
  prophet bundled at last into the hand, 
    waiting in the mind.




	

                     


                                                                                                                       
 A bird homes in the sky

 poured like dried butter 
  barking within the moth-eaten Spiritus 
  thirsty in its empty mall, screaming 
  at our stirring umbrellas: 

	 we are briefcase hard 
	 in the sense of the heart 
	 shining on the road

	 a storm glinting 
	 from mediation slogans

	 a swan flickering 
	 just over the nude curbstone, 
	   sick, knotted

 With a sluice through the withered pinched dark. 
 Her Wind like the inner tide. The Wind. 
 And a cliff of spastic steel. 
 Quick teeth from palaces. 


	

                           

 
 Crumbling the bare sitting mind, 
   we have here!

I balanced on unpenetrating bounty

 Thought that is sweet. 
 Stolen work. And I grow homesick.

 Then, there's no mind and
 the shallows spun -- hushed

	 To call

 Wallowing in the cake; stranded 
   moldy between immense stars

 Unreeled in a gusting heaven

 A god hunted;  standing in the graves of gold; 
 In habitats of weeping winter.
 
 Some thing is  the origin

  dawning, preened to sing



	

                                                                                                                       


I covet visitation; 
--I, her nest. 

 I tell this night that it was desperate.




	

                         


 Under a red branch new from a miracle

 My children gouge the wooden charts 
     of a dreadful heart

 On the same transparent shore,
 I sat Lightning in the tesselation





	

           


Night poured into destiny's shrunken bucket. 
 The encrusted, cadenced plaything of the disease. 
 
 We argue existence's ash-grey violence. 
 Locusts among the bushes of the evening. 
 



	



                                                                                                                       
 Touch, consume, dominate.

 And slip through altitudes, heaving. 
 In the brief black summer sky unseen 
 In the silent length of affinities 
 gut-sifting peremptory repertoires.




	

                                                                                                                       




Beauty is unfaltering
 It drives each thing,
     heats our shirts and tiles, 
     and bruises the hour-glass.

 
 


	

            


 I am so yours. 
 It blows my yogin exquisite mind.




	

                                                                                                                       
 



tongue snowshoes for everybody 
 gliding through the quartz stallion





	




                                                                                                                       
 my heart 
 wheels blurred

 telling me 
 a parable of the world





	

            


 
    the pained grinding
        console rot
 that keeps the sun ripened
  snail in an empty glass

	 a heartfelt
	   silence
	    crowds 
	   the fossil



	





                                                                                                                       
 Apertures

 I curved the rooms of blood. 
  Cherubim in Central ceremony's Center, 
  Orestes-like, a plow to practice splinters, 
 and wound each wood, and bring salt into numbed churches, 
	 a secret anvil slavery
	  leaping in an hour of wine. 


 


	




                                                                                                                       
 so to fathom this 

 where no one may discover 
 where the roof works at the mouth

 and dreary-voiced wheat 
 leaks a bright scar
 
 we'll take the identity of waves 
 momentarily uprooted sweaters 
 
 and the chill of brung-homes coals
 marveling over the question of the midnight





	

                                                                                                                       


THE STALACTITES 

 disappeared
 like inert cream 
 from an awning
 of horny sleep 



	


                                                                                                                       
 
 wide mauve junipers 
 shimmered in the wind
 fat old & the color of lips



	


          

AND HER EYES 

 touched like a 100 watt lamp
 his frozen face

 etching clean lines 
 into the sun




	

          




Are you going home? 

 Outside, apples the color of homage 
   bend abiding heads into sleep

 Blurry immortal fresh 
   faithless spuds 
 shine as if oblivions






	

          



   For cold lies heaven
  to kill most lost 
     beauty




	



           

 There is nothing 
  that is not slaughter 
    
    and all the distant afternoon 
         clouds settle
    where the spring moss flowering splinters 




	

                                                                                                                       
 


 Oh, born we died 
  at their call
 giving to our mouths
           ash






	

       




 And low, poised in the mind 
  that designed, 
   mother will, in we 
	   who make 
	 the goddess
	   radiant 

 The universe 
   is not a part but
     single, nothing.

Orgasm, a sky too bright 
 early before stars, poured
 scattering free homes and 
 pent, hurrying glass 




	

                                                                                                                       
 

the book of the hole
the last red door
the deer coming from the home

	 bring storms 
	 and an ostrich




	

                                                                                                                       
  Sage worms 
   moon-scented (sacred, 
   delicate, individuated, entamed, 
   dissolved, uncoiled, indecent)
      appal the sunbeams



	

                                                                                                                       
 

 To bless  the cloud 
  (emptied  unveiled bewitched  subdued) 
       a young voice levitates




	

                                                                                                                       
 



 I thought that nothing thought, 
 my hand  where I had loved you. 
 
 I thought we had died,  
 deeper than the quick. 
  
 Sometimes I saw a Summer, 
 and thought  of everyone. 
 
 In the vein of the hours, 
 prophesying never fading. 






	

                                                                                                                       





 Flesh like a foaming compact nesting
   battered movement to mend a mouth.

 We paid the horizons with flesh, 
   soothed the many-petalled sky. 
  
 I was forgotten.
 I in a pale grave. 
 I shrieking in the water. 







	

   



You took the first 
 room, and there had a vision to keep 
 a moment, for a moment cannot resist 
 talent which might rise into the earth. 
 



	





                                                                                                                       
 Brilliant and mercurial as the unconcerned 
 trimmings of an afterlife, the Receiver kept
 her vase face open softly to the last creek rose. 

 And crossed the border crater where 
 A rooster burned, outlined in cold petals.





	

                                                                                                                       

Silence lights the hills
 floating green, shallow flowing.

 maintaining with a joke, exile fangs, 
 as sandstone basks 
 in the desert vertebrae 


	

                                                                                                                       


 i-seen, random
 on the drowned train

 summer, then, helps them plunge 
 into the sea of love

   a turnstone 
 inspired by machines,
 a vast unconscious 


	





 Star-points insist
 Sun mould-black 
 Underground splinters 
 
 Phallus fogs our skin with dust, 
  and the Firebird, you, frightened 
                the core of my body 





	




                                                                                                                       
 Sing--mystery 
 
 She was not dead. 
 The bones of her day 
  faced the open lost old crab 
 carving incursions 
   under the ground 
  with his male gangster song: 
 
 		   "O, toilet ... "




	

              



 Angelic doves make my book  
 root sniff the metal 
 of inconvenient lions; 

 ebbtide scavengers 
 of delicate space 
 thinking of pain.




	

          



A daughter's flower. 
 She is like the winds
 circus wire, laughing

 circulatory, in the jaguar lights 
  dreaming the universe





	

                                                                                                                       




A HIGH-SCHOOL GUN 

 
 wander each night in shadows, 
  proud, plight, spoiled

 feed silk a Hurricane
 and see her pale miraculous hair 

 reveal what must be done 
 to the last endangered contraptions 
 






	

    





A love
  lifted momentarily
   from an avenue 
    of serpents

  Blue, the table, 
  the milk, on the pock-marked 
     telephone. 
 
 Now my mother, afraid of holding air 
   in her arms, stops the silence
      ringing in her mouth.







	

                                                                                                                       

My being sheltered 
destroyed screaming. 


	

    



 watching rain 
  pale fruit 
   wet 
    nestle  everywhere. 
 
 

 


	


                                                                                                                       
 
 balancing logos 

 like a curve of breath
 to the feet of her own ear

 she lay perfectly in birth 
 and round her calling tongue 

 held ephemeral literati 
 in hot innocent stains






	

            

  It takes quiet to feed 
     the Sea



	

                                                                                                                       


	The mist 
	  cramped 
	  clitoris
	  untied the wall.



	

    


    We are the sex
      of strangers,
      putrified, when alone.



	

                                                                                                                       

 Nowhere is the empty web of every day a Letter. 
 


	

        



   I sit in ashes ground.
 No matter, no, going here. The light?
 Indeed, understands. Because we wake
 In the aiming clothes of machines.
 




	



                                                                                                                       
	Deep 
	within my head 
	(before the lights 
	 naked polished
	  the storm) 
	   a change. 
	 



	

                                                                                                                       


	What will I think of you?
	If I hear you in the foaming
	back shadow swipe of my plastic knife 
	 silencing the mist.



	

           


   Thought walked the hills
     to think words 
    unweaved, placed on your skin.



	

          

 I come in, pushing underneath the sea,
 Keen to intrude, to celebrate entering.




	


       
 I am infixed hiding upon the broken ecstasy. 
           Everything I think I haven't sang.




	

                   




 Four bones kept me heavily dead.


 A secret, not meticulously, 
   started carving Spring. 
 
 A serious heart 
   awoke a sun, in the broken 
   and vagrant-fissured dust. 
 





	

                                                                                                                       


 I think in tilt, bicameral bereft 
  curiosity, shattering cultures and war.




	



                                                                                                                       


 the fires that count backwards for Berlin 
  comprehend the labours of earth

 the tumbling honeycombs of earth
  the seasons of perpetually chattering bedrooms
  the abyss of beginnings

  one would expect 
   when each thing
         is green





	

                                                                                                                       


sun-lit machinations
mushing among the matrixed flower
whispering our oscillating blood



	

          



 Her last weariness drooped into my pain 
        where the smoke-severed rich sea 
 Deconstructed the One Forgotten by fire.





	

                                                                                                                       

 utter grief wakes behind the hunger of songs



	




             
            demand the cessation of language


				 heartfelt
				 uninterrupted,
				 lined with laughter

				 words gleam 
				 in the sea 
				 where we walk





	

        



	TIMOROUS EYES 

	 Never touch blood. 
	 Awake the universe.

	 Above you 
	 the world
	 was eating shadows.



	

      





And I 
 think really 
 of that pain

 Older than I am,
   snarling 
   and deserted, 
     becoming my soul. 


     ~


 The indifference-resined world— 
  never quite touched.

  The bee
   a throbbing heart
    in the mind.







	




                                                                                                                       
NOTHING BUT THIS PLACE. 


 I walked the price of my dear beauty.

 Presence of passions, reeking grove,
 feathered and bright meadows; wild dark heaving
 unreasonable hatreds, a simple vow.

 How many anesthesiologists do you know? 
 



	



		                                                                                                                       
		 As one 
		 does 
		 one wrapped 
		 time.



	

            

 Shall we burn every year in the wakeful
 Blood and remember dominoes?
 


	

     

	 
	 I sat on meteors

	 in a church of old 
	 word—catastrophes 

	 found blank 
	 in field-flower 
	 prisms: 

	 fiends and satin-logic 
	 murmurings of night




	





                                                                                                                       
 For it All Requires Rearrangement


 Miseries walk in the manifold 
  secret light of the earth. 
 
 Our shadows lift
  the black brow 
  of branches, 
  swinging forever.

 Lifted in heartbeats or unhappiness, 
    desperate windows in us 
  Assault sprawled and butchered woods. 





	

                                                                                                                       



high on the idea 
 of young love

  sleepless : sickness 



	

           



SO OFTEN MOCK-HORMONAL -- 

 
 Clouded as a wire. hand-painted, 
  bars on which the strokes 
  of the arcing walls of tombstones gape: 
 
 We are pain, 
  coleslaw, moon apple 
  media whims, and white-washed
  stares, perched in a fresco.

 Everyone is gone,
       rendering love 
    in the sun's spires

       so calm and dangerous, 
     their forests pure and correct 
 their memory corner needles evolving 
      a being real dreamed thought

    before disappearing in a stream 
  of passion: wounded muffled light





	

      



AND UNKNOWN. 

 In the madhouse 
 he had already frayed the lobster 
 wove some intangible beginnings into predictions 
 pictures were made bodies
 and everything, unnamed -- cried:

 It begins in your hair
 iceberg rationalism, alone, 
 valour crackling 
  blood





	

                                                                                                                       




There we lay; some bedstraps crossing the edge of the sills, 
 shrieks of light costuming the waterfall against the pear.

 We come back into the crusted air, in the grave, 
  laugh in (exhaled, fanatic) 
   moss passion, where skin
    comes to praise.





	




                                                                                                                       
 It was still comparative
  a skein of forms
  full of glades

 protests and the clear pointed city 
  cutting out nimbostratus

	  we were following
	 hallelujah coupled sharks
	 thru the halted war 





	

          


	 
	 naked angel
	 visiting the stranger

	 because the rock
	 desired   wounds




	

          



 We all laboured to posture rhyme, 
 Which been lacking, on the outcrop 
 Among the tonguing temptation, and the sidewalk 
 Dripping fire




	

            



 The wind masters
 the raw crystal-formation
 belonging to open delay. 
 
 Virus, Triton, Rumsfeld, Armado. 
 Pipes shuffling suiciding blows.



	

          



 
 And I go,
 Ended in the gladness of the soul

 I say that every day is a morning 
   failing, confused and sparse

 I hold sleeping book—word powers; 
 I am a shrimp propellor. 

 And the daisies. 
 I believed I made.

    A black beak hung in my bucket. 


 


	




                                                                                                                       
Song of Sex 

 A woman's mouth is 
 painted on the horizon

 thickening its shining spring, the dark grass is poured 
 in her first tree, and the coated bud of the night grows 
 by the moon that puts her life against the day, 
 walking over old reason toward the dead 




	

                   


You will survive the bruises
from that euthanized trio
 


	






 I tore my gown, soft among birches.
 I absorbed the tongues of solitary animals. 
 I was the rockledge sun floating by the waters. 
 I saw bulbs gleam in the sweet blessed close-knit laughter of sorrow. 





	

         



 Constrained companions, 
 touch the grove
 unmated, by the sob. 
 
 Tomorrow, replace
 the spectacle itch:
 help the sufficient 





	

      


 And in the wrath
 Of this boat, 
 Strange cholera
 Pains take on, through a thing of hands, 
  a dreadful stain




	




                                                                                                                       
 Possums, goslings, hoodoo bustling
  ambiguous genre exquisite signs

 A shadow of honey 
  shudders





	

         



the sun in her cries to thorn-ridged, 
   lullaby. then scalps the bombs' burial

the grand section of the eye, a petal  
   trapped in jaw-to-ass sweat





	

                                                                                                                       
 


 and, so entering the way 
 which is human
 a thinning web of idols 
 blossomed
 home over sun

Confer, the mighty Crown 
  (Jove lay the mind)

 And then, the dew wrote
 mottled and pale wet 
 chance among thawed envy





	

              


 doom the time of austere enclasping deserts 
 and wasted prescription and inclusion 
 in the inauspicious world pawned intermittent grass. 




	



                                                                                                                       

 And this blood was to be counted
 Called for later if we returned
 it was to complete what things opened

 and the bare facade of its (destructive and ashen) will
 weaves every place like an old butterfat 
 curves crepuscule moss into meditation





	





                                                                                                                       
ACROSS THE DEAD — 

 Lambs in a sky 
  of frozen 
 rumination, hooting, 
  to distract us
  with retirèd doctrines
 
 Standing in great darkness, 
   hauling the wind, 
 rising, slightly cold 


 


	

                





AND THE ONE SHALL SCOLD FLESH 

 
       A great limping 
 Heart, soft on life — 

           apt to be ashamed 
 rode power into unendowed time

   went to its knee in a swamp
  of nourishing pills, - clean  
   watching the enthralled die 






	


                                                                                                                       
 And Rhinehardt 
 ran from the rayon fence 
  ran from its wrath

 And the world of authentic speed
  walking the bubbles home
   in the deepest plumes, 
     pawing your arm

 Numquam! O, I'm sorry 
          I had much-loved 
 yet careless, I die
 
 and what therefore I didn't say 
        seeps in,  living,
  returns, 1934-2014 
 
 As I ordered  the hours
 Rejoicing,    to take away 
               the world.

 A moth presses the old water  
   buys integrity from its heart



	

    


TO FIND. 

   life then, on the streaked floor 
     glistening, tamed, baked into odds: 
     wingbeats urging ego into delivery. 



	




                                                                                                                       

A FACSIMILE of topology

 Juniper within a long-lived house

 An identity subjugation bed

 Winter of the soundless camping: 
 as I walk on the grass where the children grow

 Compelled by a city's breath.

 Watches fires.

 for joy in her mouth



	

                                                                                                                       
  hairy 
  dog
  frenzy 


	

       

 
 we mocked rocks 
 at the invisible gate

 mimes, in the taxis of ken



	

         








 sour and barefoot, tattooed with water,
 those blossoms, old and sick, are songs
 melting denial, as wide as the earth, 
 on which we breed










	


                                                                                                                       
 




 On the brazen sands of the future, 
  rocks burnt the voices of the ocean:

			 unseemly entanglements, 
			 cages adopted  to last.







	

                                                                                                                       

 On the pulse of hello
 three words 
  rub the cup

 a bird flowing 
 as fresh as an old meadow 
  vagina

 The strength of wild feathers
 is all we have: 

 not the dead

 Eclipse All 
 

 Beautiful, too weak, I abate. 
 Dactylic and turnip blueberry, 
    higher full slate. 

 A Sibelius of hope, a gesture. 
 A striptease wreck dead path
    running into the lake. 

 Almost suspicious. 
 No one listens
    to the gods at home.






	

                


 
 Mother dies, and armies
 Dreaming of voices
   conspire. 
 




	

         





 Self-love is woe.

 to stomp on the wing 
             of death



	




                                                                                                                       
 

 Camden. Honey. Thoracic. Refugio. 
 
 Oak spininess hushed in horses. 
 Grizzlies coiling joy. 
 The river that is doubt.






	

                                                                                                                       




   Death

   fragile
 I'm calling 
  softly 
   the disappeared
 




	




desperate incandescent
petrified transvestite
lame ravenous Jesus




	

  


 And we Know Nothing of the Nest 
   the shivering armful of its silent surface
   gathering snake, rabbit and maverick
   in the kitchen of Endangered Imagination.




	

                 




TO THAT THOUGHT, I JOINED SORROW 

 with ardor once more
 to take away some hour 
 and stir its murmuring gutters 
 
 and dense, bark by the hedges
 hiding my head over the upper lip of my neck 
 noting no place where thought could tread 





	

        



I have no loss, 
 let them grieve and mock
  this Quiet
 




	





 So this keening wants to try,
  the hard seat of the Haloed.

 Perhaps the time that unaware, 
  Viaduct speckled, figures
 Vernal satisfaction and love.

IN THE NIGHT 

 self-absorption asks: 
	 should I do green? 
	 remember the kitchen scalding blue?
	 buy rubber cigarettes? 
	 double the hands, shrouded up like a tablecloth? 
	 change before one last bored effort at sex?




	

      



 
 I was seen dorking racehorses. 
 Teaching stones to sing. Opening 
 Airstreams through the maples. 

 I wanted to 
 whisper. 
 
 I'd give them a feel 
 I was doing nothing.






	

                                                                                                                       



 Louche mockingbird's heart on the sagging crest:
  so pathetic,

 Laugh to me, my heart 
 Grow on my throne like a stain. 

 Tread the sun with horrible chowder.




	

                                                                                                                       

And meaning all the things I was to see
in my heart, your name. 



	




                                                                                                                       
MR. BIBLE IS NOT GOOD 

 me, I am better
 me, clean earth 

 Mr Bible married such blessings 
 he loosened chubby silver quarreling. 
 
 I was the black slave plantations 
 where he had Churches and Sawmills.

 I was the target 
 crosshatching on a she-whale's 
 side hit by his harpoon.
 
 And his theft of death into heaven, 
 where death is enervated, I will not tolerate.





	

                                                                                                                       
    everything is afraid to sleep 
 and motion destroy:  
  yawning doubt.


	

      




Satan fruit-warmed

 eyewhites and thatch 
 spit, with dead Angels 
 curled against the menopausal backlight 
  
  suffering
       snug sad lives
        destroyed by trivia






	

               



  Isn't it incredible how Armageddon
insults reality? Darkening its fragrance 
 so that this small morning begins 
       with these light cries? 
 



	




                                                                                                                       
WHAT WE MUST TAKE TO THE END. 

 imprison me, Bardo 
 clouded symbol,  
  winter glass, pinewoods, 
  chest ground void, 
  sun pincers, mute brick.




	

                                                                                                                       
CANCER 

 Much like a machine,
  its undershirt is rivulet gasoline. 
 
 And it is the duty, the stone, and the abyss 
  hands of judgment. 

 And it is an attribute of honey, 
  when it frees the light of God. 
 

 


	

  

 I watched stars 
 know surrounding 


	


     
     And when Odyssey came to windmills 
   with the scent of the harbour
 I was a man, though I had to sleep 
 and slept in the crying way of the moon: rose-amber, 
 upholstered at three-forty-five. I could see nothing 
     but to write this as it burned.



	

     



Hot dolphins sack 
 the horizon where men in scorned Infection 
  command an abyss. 

  Not Infected with 
 the pleasant old 
 inimitable meditation of dreams

      but an Infection 
       within my throat 
    driven by quartz light to fire.





	





 I've kissed my dreams
     on your tongue.





	




                                                                                                                       
 Pride throws him on the moss, the grave 
 molten bars that tiptoe down, smoking
 the sound of yellow blooms, curled 
 on a film of champagne horses.





	

                                                                                                                       

 
 "In the future, we have to spend to die."



	

  

 
 Moon 
 stirred the grief 
 of man.

 Wet PCBs
 and bourbon
 of a distant accumulated shroud.



	

                                                                                                                       

	There was the sky again! 

	 And now we die 
	 In a mall
	 As sacred slaves.

 Along the swelling ridge of eagle's willow estuary 
  a searching wolf roams the hardwoods

 Among rivers born 
  dripping from the hills

 Where sun 
  strikes earth. 




	

                                                                                                                       
 
 
 I have seen restless words pitying the experience 
 of human history, the immaculate shadow 
 beating in the music of Nations 

	 the cross of pressure 
	 on beauty to purify. 
	 


	

          



THE YEAR'S HEART 

 still in its fallen glowing lax
 radiating Congo bright shirt 
 wondering if the burning clouds
 and rice closed in its flowers
 get their wars from random catalogues





	




                                                                                                                       
A MILD PACKAGE AROMA 
 
 I think with some indifference, the music of the heart 
 composed of soft birch buds and eucalyptus
 is an encumbrance,-- nothing else.




	


                                                                                                                       

 We perish in these arteries, 
  these books done for the poor. 
 
 Sad afternoons flensing the cycles of the lily,
 The radio, a stone, pecked-over, in dusty rain. 




	

                                                                                                                       

 Words sleep to sing to each other.

 Ah, to the Church I came in September 
 triumph burned into my coherence
 torrents enclosed merrily in my amazement 
 to fuck soot-blooming wood-nymphs
 in that ignoble place where absorption denied pain.





	


                                                                                                                       
A TINY 

 Chamber of frozen breasts
 in bed, mouths silent 
 calm, each sweet glass thigh meadow 
 mouth, a blotted spurter, a pious 
 bowel. Puzzlement unrehearsed.



	

                                                                                                                       
Locusts 

  Leaned through the field with conclusions 
    I couldn't remember, lusts tangled 
       and clamped, lured by music 
    in the dark, through the old city 
      to the cruel heart, gene pack.


	

                                                                                                                       

		 Side glistening 
		 and blue 
		 with the wind

  we came back to their villages 
   beneath their sickly lights
  where stains evicted streams into dust 
		 
		 folded up 
		  a hurricane 
		 to light the pier
		 
		  sutures 
		 where insects invited 
		  night onto the shore


	

                


This is the journey: spasm scream.

 War smells better. The fallen star,
 the bitten deer, the tracked fireflies, 
     the sweat of green dust.

An underground orchard, clay 
 touches in the fields. Alone: 
 its shadow ripens constellations 
     of foaming tears.




	


 Illuminated whispering
 cut the Damasque throat 
 
 voluptuous muscle 
 of precision, releases

 the fragile bark of perfumes, 
 solemn flowers, clear days 
 
 The smell of metal


	

                                                                                                                       
 
 the sun was on the floor 
     new-grown, dozing and waiting 
         as if in snow



	

                         


Sometimes I too betray the world behind my tongue.
 I let Sight, who is not apprehensive, speak.

 My avocado self makes me burn
  a message that slips from the womb. 
 
 


	

       



behind that most abundant froth 
stand the stained rods of virtue

 an existence some remember 
 and when profitable exalt

 		   ~

	 on this lake 
	  rain drives 
	   my tongue






	

      



	we did not chew
	gold in the abyss

	 nor triumph 
	  over trauma's
	   singing body 




	




I am with everything 
 perceived:

 A catheter memory of a happy childhood 
 Where life wouldn't end on some trampoline. 

 My bike, big vases, and a strewn arbor -- 
 All that I have become summon lies.




	

                                                                                                                       

the spirit of the heart 
was the chemistry 
 which welcomed delight



	


         


 
 On the live sea, a sentiment.

 A holy boat caught in an oblique 
 odor; frightened, carved from its 
       sleep, buds.





	

    



She never puts it in verse: 
       does not embed skin 
               in the telling.

 She, in self-denial, receives the rats.

 In her wing-burdened arms are mint walls, 
    and mists that sing of plums.




	




                                                                                                                       

In the fruit of fungus stand signs: death breathing
 starlight, birds immune to curses,
 cliffs of actions, the swaying dawn
            of love's tranquil frost.






	

        



 After many poems, I'm like
  smoke among sea-waves
  diving thrust-out blurry





	




 Along the Sun’s wondrous beam of axioms, 
    love mates with the coffins.




	

        









		         myths 
		          wake  
		          home 
		         light











	

 





Death's lifeless skin torches individuation, 
  enclosing it inevitably into depths.

 Leaving the formless 
  unremarkable name of hope
 at the door of the garden in the throat.

THE GATE 

 Should I drive on empty?
 
 as I methamphetamine
 smooth over the slow
 enslaved flame



	

 




 When I will be gone?
 Murmurest at the murmuring 
 Seams of an hour's quick burning grace






	

       
       To Abstraction 
 	   Bring Artifice


	


                                                                                                                       
 Lakeview, up the hillside, on the land 
  where misshapen goats watch precarious nature.

 Here hunger looms: 
  prison! dogsleds, caveman gaseous, lexicals all-at-once, 
  and sandwich's stench.

 Art doing a sublunar polestar protest all alone.



	





         Everyone who seems to be living came 
				from a dream in the sky
				muttered light of larva.
				 




	

                                                                                                                       

	my ecstasies happened
	 and limped as mist

	 agonized unpatterned gulps
	 lump dwelling in thumping 
	 enlanting indecipherables

	 


	

         


A fear of earth turned back to its heart. 
A machine sleeps there in the bridges it renewed.



	

                                                                                                                       
	Plutocracy Buffet. 
	 
	 "Metamorphoses?" 
	 Our resentment is here.

	 Waving at the sun, 
	  to take penitence

	  in a gilded bathtub
	  of cold silk 
	  on Facebook. 


	

                                                                                                                       

The light of sound on the body, 
convinced of ashes, in stillness

 choleric mites, and crop green, 
 queries fit to O0000OOOO, 
 falcons to a stratagem.

 I am so bitter. 
 Why must I feel so complete?
 


	


   

 If singing I bring you to be
   unbroidered in an orchard of vagueness

   bringing thrush home with Sappho
   to understand the long-forgotten





	




                                                                                                                       
Still I lie like a tree 
 where the lone stone light unwrappable 
 counterturns up from your face 

 and the last recycled scrawny texture
 of snow dented spring, the car 

 red clad in rust; turns my weight reading 
 to spare your mastery, plucks a hum 
 directly from the hole.





	

                                                                                                                       
 

 Yield to the garden of union 
   murmur an elemental storm

   chrysolite ecstasy
   primeval stain



	


                                                                                                                       
   hemlock tumult of the self

	   dejected bird 
	   tucked nectar


	

                                                                                                                       

Repent sweetness, 
 peering through the dry splendour

 She appeared in 
 Every thought

 As acoustic chalk: 
  Virgin to the obsession petal



	

       

in my head
mud and waves



	

    



 Flood-tide at the sea, 
 pealing. Rattles, flames: 

 And you who loomed unhindered flaking 
 in the amber bandages
 of self-inflicted 
 specialized disability
 
 Worthless till 
 proficiency, hobbled near
 a dry reflection of Midsummer 
 calm.

 There is nothing but this forever! 
 



	


                                                                                                                       
Trade

 The Pains of Weepers
 For Laundry: Deathcolored, White 

 Mouths: faint and interspersed 
 On a nameless Page, Striplings

 Shrieks and swift Ghost Pulse
 Comical vermin sullen Stones.



	

      


We are the lure of love

  Anything, even non-placed
  plunging mud. Or a sleep:

     cold and elemental 
     seething in itself





	

           


Erase the copse and soar, 
	 but do not go higher than the waves 
	     or stray over the broken orchard 
	  
 Tides strewn with chastity and bones 
 Televisions underfoot, trampling mimesis 
 Reconstructing an unbearable descent

 Stacked and scorched absence,
 Filtered sweat, and choreographed desire.





	

                                                                                                                       



	 for the abundance
	  of the hope 
	  of the wind: 

	 yawning, 
	  I focus 
	  on the playground.

 His rifle scrawled in his lap 
 Horrid eyes in an awful cave

 I have suffered forty years
 Times manifold like the Swans mingling 

 Cold as the puzzled Wind
 Where the ships beat away

 For I am not here 
 And I do not pretend 

                       


Stout Fields Next to a Butterfly 
Philosophy's Strangled Neck       

 Contrived to mix eternity,
  conceiving to unite careless 
  murder, salacious and vapid science 
  and to leave thirst, heart-piercing 
  strong and deserted, snowblue in granary dust 

         



At The Last 

 I felt a kind of writing
             in the heart 

 I found the one who made me 
 years ago, thinking of dust

 I gathered my dissolved dreams, 
 and hid patience in this book.






                                                                                                                       
Goddamn Winged 

 Hurts are a perfect ending 
 For the vacancy of years.

 So in fixed light and silence 
 And the numb flack of July

 Mothers of each family 
 Drag a law toward old men 

 As they decide on the graves 
 for us human potatoes 


          



O We are Reptiles 


I dance now in the the old lagoon, 
 plow the driveway, look and blow out air, 
 gnaw a great breeze, dark and
 wild as the yawning 
 years, while my many little children, 
 seditious, make jewelry water.

Peep 

 watch him watching the gray 
 morning over a hermit river
 
      



 Deep in a deadwood pool 
           source shakes. 
 
 Euripides' gods will die!

 Even as time-mama-phanic stars 
      taunt paths with pinwheeling 
                  statistical loops. 


                         



After Months of Kneaded Ratios 
 
 
 Hundred-year-old avocados,
      feed the hammer knife 
 deliciously captured blood


                  



 We scaled the ochre darkness 
 tracing green reeds over the corkscrew hills 
                along dim blue limbs of light. 

 Each at every block of the prayer
  planted an eye to see the cradle:

				        a peacock on a pillow, 
			      a tongue under a frozen sky.


               



Lost As Silences 

 Start from the country, a sorrow
  weed that bends a postcard dark. 
 
 It's one more excellent foolish 
  fire to die from. 

 Attractively, its heart-honored flames, 
  call on bellies to protect circulation.


                                                                                                                       
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I open 
 my dark eyes
 abhorring my life.





     


Quiet -- 

 
 Recall this world, 
  have no hope to endure. 

 It's then so eloquent
  as if a book


                                                                                                                       
 

 Pan Moves Erratically Over a Different Bridge


 He waited, much rapturous over the world, 
 hoping the sun's scarce writing on a clouded lake 
                     might spell birds or mermaids.


 And he can't remember how to make 
  the flawed arguments of names 
                  into separation.


                      



 That day the artist-god: a half-dead entity
			 enormous, arrived ermine-bright
			                    full of rust

 Sadness kept reflecting intelligence, valerian 
   wrinkling water, the studded horned doorways, 
                         rolling dry upon rocks. 


                 



Concealed 

			 wolves. 
			 avaricious.

 sparsely placing translation-bracken thorn
  fatigue-smoking fingertips behind ash-gray 
             zealous whole-flour purgatories


                


 With the fierce light
 Of a great strangering
 Imagination entered a lazy sky. 
 
 Real air 
 Circled the hub. 


                  


 Calm, back-lit in the brain,
 considered praise or fear stems. 
 
 As a brown hawk draws in granite, 
 surely, finally, flirtatiously

 Weary apprentices stare
 at pools pale with scum.


                                                                                                                       


I earned the blue light 
 It was my happy surge, my song 
 I drew the glass, met your eyes
 trembled, and said: "By you ..." 

       




Dinosaurs 

 honeyed grief 
 spit  out 
 the last cloud 




                



Dinna Levertov 
Waits for you
With an anatomical truth
Suspended in Green jelly. 
 
 

 


She unwrapped love, 
  yes, so familiar: 
 
 Mildew, pigeons, shrubbery, 
  death! An enticing devotion:

 Silent conviction sponge 
  the line between bodies. 
 
          


 
 I am continuous:
  anticipating midnight incessant, 
  blushing truths,

 Boulders 
  doodling deepening
  causes to sing 
 
 A sweet cliff
  to extend over. 
 

         




Gagging Eve

time wriggled off alone 
 past the schadenfreude 
   celebration of those unheard



      




121311 


 The milky labor of a rainbow: 
 life-giving clumps of empty inscriptions.

 Laughing willow-vicious
 fluffy reproachful precedents 
 
 Destroy 52% of truth.



                



And when the head dwells in the green 
 gutters and moves that horizon 
 where the body wanders 
 and the stones are blocked with
 the long bones that anchor the sun, 
    the heart, and its rider, gleam. 
 
 
                                                                                                                       
 
 
 
 
 
 In the loss of the hope of what 
  it is to take in this morning 

 The storm or the stream 
  where no one will look




                    



 Warm wide-open Orchard-smooth
 tender-unconscious compliant-Present!


                                                                                                                       
 


 Grief's forklift-curled 
  deep-green blood-eyelids 
  guide the day to lyric's 
         
         defenseless mire 
         fire, desires
        
        huddling 
        unstated



                                                                                                                       



 We are lavender drifting through this 
  square, our settled mountains do not answer.

 by such an unchanging beauty

 follow the raw air
 past the wired roots

   a curl that counts pity

 Out of the heat beyond land, 
  the oblivion of the heart,

 The waves are broken.

 The dreams of the soul 
  the first songs of the isle, 
  the breath of the wild, 
  the clear wind.



                 






 Two whistles, two thousand scrolls. 
 I am all the way into the question. 
 
 Somewhere, my chewed branches, 
   my gray birds, my goats, and
   my hands incur immense flowers, 
   as though my nerves were a suitcase.





          





Savagery 


 Riots brush Jericho Necrotic access 
  across the screaming Beasts of skies; 

 What want intent?

 I have wandered so much seeking 
 peace, -constantly dissatisfied

 accepting noise as madness, rejecting 
 the war faith, glistening naugahyde

			 diving for the common honey 
			 body hides in resistant hole 


      


 'Tis time to curse this day 
     since the world's bliss is in me, 
     and the world is lonely. 
 

                                                                                                                       
 
 


 
 
 Sonnet 
 
 
 My heart is behind me, the wind turns to 
 Shadow on the fallen grass. I have thought 
 Something alone with my reason as it 
 Sits in the cold stream eating raving hints 
 Cleaned in the springs of the mixed ibises.
 Every stone a breast, a subjection
 Which can never lighten this scar loan mouth. 
 A note swimming awake through dead polite 
 Delight. Such soft ripe accents of spirit gain 
 Enough lechery to veil the canker 
 Trivia. Restraint! Random temptation!
 Consummation uprisen from leafmould,
 Wanders self-denial protoplasm.



  



    

                                                                                                                       
 hammers retexturing
 the roads, a dozen trees peel
 the wind and reveal the blood 
 of a distant solar landscape. 
 
 
 
 

 



Omen Solitude in which the Bomb Prays

	for the last bridge, with a clock 
	 in the river of the sky
	  knows that it is not

 Somewhere one or two short years 
  Spawn thru cracked and yellow light,
  Leaking unpredictable conversations. 

			 Raining passionate heat, 
			 A hundred colors hissing.

 sleeping 

 and every thing was thereon tired 
 with no discordant motion but 
 the dark bud chug numb of spring's weeping neck 
 
 no more than one speaks of stars, or of what 
 the brink repeats up and down as it loves

  drawn from nature's  latest  dream 
 illuminates the edge of these fervors like 
  a thoughtless poet 
            

 because this world is the end 
 there is room 
 for old age 
                    



 Where cruelty and gristle whisper 
  tiresome grief infantalises dead 
  cursed creation, perennial 
      and stubborn as a lock.


               





 Think of the grave as a wall
    anarchy crafts from flesh

 The gloss of a kennel 
    with sky for feet

 the sap is done with the wounded 
  and just the soul 
 is down

 I know what I say

 loose in tender fields 
      on the glossy lawn 
  she would drop the dark

 and in the field of the field
  complement returning with a fearless wing! 




                

 Vortextique Approves 
               





 Now we say it is as if the bells dropped out 
   as if the humming lights are beating 
   nascent heads sequestered everywhere

 Nantucket light, the wind-like splitter wings 
   bent, the lashes and the face bent, 
   and the trial bent in bed 
	 
	    bees and angel 
	      make assured poets
	      				bent




                                                                                                                       




She goes inside the window for me 
  to brush the hidden land


   






		       This morning gentle rain 
		    tongues light frosty snares 
	   snaking thru tinctured sentences.

  Hollowness comes, curdling to scatter
            longing intervals connected 
  by climax. Idle, gone, a future caged

	 swoons inhaling someone's story, a 
	  wanderer dazzled by rolling light.





                                                                                                                       




This godawful grilled pool. 
Puglia righteousness flesh curl. 
Inquisition tinsel. 
Institutional curtains' bull. 


                        




  empty banks burst across 
  the maternity bridge 
  lugging absurd sandfleas 
  from the unpremeditated
  abacus of language








			 Deep in my core 
			 my body holds 
			 each word.

 And as young Penelope casts
   a flawed fable to the centre

 Sunlit vines seed diamond shadows 
   on maple leaves in the old depths.

 A light autumn rain ticks all night 
   to feed the worms a silent clock.

 Clear off the masks 
  which guard night: 
     I want reason to be crying, 
     Let everything else last! 
 
 Choose a dream now, 
  hunched, overwhelmed:
     I want a place clean of words,

In the throats of the old trees: arguments. 
 Born of this story, you see the dead 
    funereal silent road in the forest 
         as the last fragment.

 No One Has Ever Met


 On the sad fields that drink
 The cold wine of dark night 

 Not in forests of sacred shapes
 By quiet poplars whose
 Faces never asked to be put aside

 Nor in fire where crowds 
 Reveal the peace of survivors

 Down the river, my people are not mine. 
 
 I see them in their bodies 
   moving into houses 
 
 Scolding women scooped 
   up from the shadows 
   of the dead 
 
 I am the first to see 
   the fallen light 
   of the sea fail

 Thus the city spirals 
 Do not breathe any sound

 We are what described them.

 Our lives are still still still. 
 Our fields turn time into sorrow.

 We shove a great trouble from a beige town.

 I liked everything

 When I glanced in your eye,  
 I saw a bull in a good cloak. 
 
 I watched you suffer,
 glittering and gleaming,
 in an ashy room.



            



 Go! 
 
 Leave the hospitals

 Leave the canyons

 Leave flesh lost in power

 She is dying.
 It is morning. 
 Shadows are heavy.

 She enters the Hudson.

 Best seen with 
 Eyes that do not exist.

 Paris died,

 hueless, disease flaming, 
 
 It radiated a final earthlessness, 
 A sight to stab bombs, 
 Organic censure.

 Over sweet graves of human thrones

 I am green as the weight 
 of an autumn sculpture 
 
 The target of a mattress 
 left by a stranger 
 
 In the mouth of the world, I am
 a body pretending to be a knife! 
 
 A home-made brine-bird 
 weeping Trakl phrases.

 Seedless exposed, 
 Perfect slaughter.

 And as the long, curling cage of night turns blue, 
 its slanting blossoms fall in slow brandy breezes, 
 Driving the hills from spring to that same ground, 
 Where moss slipping on the whole swell of the sea 
 Taught my heavy life how to fill trees, with song. 
 





                                                                                                                       




 And in the morning I pull on my hands 
 and look in the rooms of light.


 Photons are very cold 
 And they carry out 
 Days that are poor 
 That know nothing 
 and think words beautiful. 
	 

	 The sky is our heart.
	 The mountains our head.




                        



 I realize that in a way,  
 what lives in the world, 
 lives in misfortune 
	 
	 in a sea, alone, 
	 mirrored, hidden 
	       by process.

 The sun came to me. 
 
 


                                                                                                                       



 In that garden, arms forgave
 the fermentation of seclusion

            



 No one is sure how the world knows

 Well what is it, that which is the soul?

	 
	 Surely none of the ground:
	  filled with its own love and plans; 
	  the dreamt pleasures of the day 
	  more silent wins on the battleground 
	  of pendant and ominous squid

	 
 And maybe not even the bones of women 
  sturdily creeping past pastoral quiet

 Nor the mineral of some future's 
  dim soil, its spiral shadows
  flinched from an ancient obelisk

 Nor a ring in the field 
  a flower reaching 
  about the thin curled sun

 Nor the hours gestating in an oak 
  stained & sleeping in eternal height 
 
 Nor the flick of a naked shrine 
  in the shadow of our blood

 Nor the solitude of engines
  handcuffed in eggs 
 

	 I throw on a golden-crowned ark 
	  a parliament of languor spruce, 
	  and snorting thug-soup
	  save a spool of realization 
	  a convenient despondence
	  designated as incredible.

 the way to that last promising difference:  
 craggie sacrum torn, sobbing, behind the milk

 Alone, among the voiceless 
 Aware of being the precision of happiness 
 A strong reflection of light made fluent 

 Bearing those whose own human glee can never 
 Bear a stranger's smile, or an animal 
 Who holds the centre of the dry knots

 With a living scream 
 In the freakish evening 
 Of your swamp 
 
 An ungraspable 
 All wanders
 On drunken terms

 Singing lazily 
 Of an exit

 Lord of the Flowers I Love


 The luminous well wilded presences 
  peacefully, all night, working 
  the weak sounds, and the mountains 
  with their fingers in the sky, and 
  the flash of orchards swaying into snow 
  as flowing beige silhouettes. 
 
 Long after that year when we met 
  light escaping the river wind, 
		  lived every morning 
		  in time's completion.

by the boat, we will reach 
 where we have been, and each other 
 own a good world to tell




                 






 Hurricanes, narrating
 concussions, wrinkle 
 in every tribal room. 

 On cool weekends 
 old pills, at meals, 
 stroll over stubble. 

 And in the veins 
 between lives,
 faces catch in 
 thoughts.

 If we do not love 
 ourselves, completing 
 the acute beauty ends.





                  




 And now, it is Bryant's iambic

 Chasing candies before his nap, 
  which looks at the door mistakenly to argue:

 That this heart is a certain smile of 
  an old old innocence bathing in the sea

 To where I was a temple,

 Wanting In One Abandoned Phrase

 
 To you I held the horizon.

 But the dying angel, 
 which I feared,
 went first to you.

 What I want, I am. 



                 




 
 I'm happy! I'm a tangled meme 
 trampling untranslatable

 I don't taste the names
 Of the prayers increasing inside my eyes. 

 My streets lead toward an empty restaurant;
 Walking plum north, I am laughing diamonds.

In The Fist Of A Dry Problem

 
 That solid elegy movement, that is this 
 one in two, each lip, travelling to the next, 
 a brain, trimming the bled wheels 
 of peril, or regret, arranging  
 the unknown inside, tuned to a shred 
 of swollen smoke, feeding to grow.
 



                



 And now the lights 
  marry the fish, 
 And I'm happy, having fun, 
 On this blustering day 
 Carrying the grafts of the drums, 
 To the Whiskey-Whizzgigs oil-permeated 
 Formal Medici account; easing to rest 
 Within the leper's world.

 I take courage from my bed. 
 I do not breathe.
 
 I listen to the light. 
 Heart creeps into eye.

 Roaring with song, 
 Hands in the ditch. 
 
 To the grave, I say, 
 To hear feathers tread.

Flarings 


 this morning gazes at statistics -- 
  its muscles pounce, grazing
      sleeping data

 undersea 
 insomnia sings,
  staining bushes 
   with mourning 





                                                                                                                       
 





 I am the blush of love-root,

 Three feet out.

 Embroidered on the corn

 And then the hour's art 
  sped within, impaled 

 I end in my lips. 

 And from what friends are not long gone, 
 I sometimes draw dust, suck thefts 
 With gold wings, photogenic 
 Love flying down 
 As I turn and turn.

 Meaning in the more that has never been.

 Blood turns into meat, 
    each forkful 
   guiding progress.

       I have no companion.

       I hear the ground sing.




  






Thirty Years 

 No one could say
 I do not care.
 
 Infinite time, waking! Yet,
 What hurts me most is the last moment. 
 
	 In this dream 
	  a woman is shaving 
	  an airplane 
	  as her bowels
	   flower.

 A sweet apple-bee breath Coltrane

 I love it

 the manifold frost before summer
 the sky like a flower 
 the lines on the ground where the gulls are

 & the wind that rises to keep 
 the green water prodigal





                  




And Grandfather's
				pigeon-shit
				silken-sailed
				crone arms

 attain the final play, 
 bathed in kindness,

 concave, uneasy, screaming, quenched
 his descendant sex walks

 in analogy thru a thick kleenex good-night

The Divine Peach  

 Exists as a layer of Albion ephemeral 
  chaste wit gnawing false unknowns

  An animal holding so much delight 
   it breaths without seeing the moon



       


Said The Seer 

 Lend me a treasure. 
 Migrate to and fro.

 Go where the horizon needs to be loved.

Peas
 on the windowsill
 green and very young. 
 
 The bosom of the Creator is sad. 

 Morning is shattered by some festival 
   that only Love will find. 


   





Eyes keep clouds under bricks.

 And things 
   have long been 
  the same as they are now, 
   days are the same as any other days, 
      and souls are eager to know love.




                                                                                                                       





 He suffocates me:

  because the truth is 
  born when he is here

  in his quiet head 
  through his bones

  thinking the iron 
  touch of the dead

As Made in Dreams 


 Music suspends the agony of words. 
 Reason slams, far away, into the back of the sun.
 Delight releases fangs to guide nowhere. 

 A riddled playground
 Covers the frame. 
 
 Weathered masks
 Become shelters.




      




 On this great night 
 I must write from you! 
 
 Give a world in which 
 I do not need to be.

 Let myself be invisible, 
 No more than a dumb image.

 My heart bright 
 Like a sad 
 Broken ember. 
 



                                                                                                                       
 




 Phrenologist's Intramural Tubing Nirvana 


 tripwires 
 taxicab, tidal 
 weeknights, hurricanes

 pivot-bidding foxglove-beautiful 
 pre-spring taper parkway-gliding 
                  groves where sex stipples me. 

 A kept shudder carcass embalming depth.



                                                                                                                       



I break the tenderness of must --
  voyage clean to warmer brooding 


                                                                                                                       



Perhaps each shadow 
 in your shoulders 
  shortcutting fire,
   rises, to take in
 jettisoned hot dreams

 Beyond the hills where 
 a faint wind caresses

 some trees flower before dawn

 I smell the air

 I thought I was a place too astonishing to read.
 I lived in the mirror in the middle of my heart.

 I stretched the spools of my hands; I mapped time, 
 retrieved a blade of blood from a hissing dark. 
 
 I saw nothing.



                                                                                                                       





The Measured Wish

     aspired to meaning, a meadow 
          poured on starving flames,

     a quilt of secret somber flesh, its sugar 
    coinciding with something found 
 
 and when it laughs 
 driving thru the night, deodorized
  hopes swinging from the rear-view 
   gather cold sudden uncertainties. 
 
 
 
 
  
            


 my pillow on my hip 
 not my hip in my hands
 
               



I am born in the dark

 called into flesh 
 to slaughter death 

 a country that smells of dreams 
 children that eat the words of hired worms



             





 I thought to myself: this might be 
 a nice way to be healthily buried 
 in a contemplation of speech.

 Each day, light wakes, still, bewildered,

 And all that is absolute is restored
 In that vigor of your human body. 

 A temporary floating kettle fragrance
 Born to bite, tie shoes, and calibrate time.

 A hearth as large as an ancient empire, 
 An artist trash-pile seeking a goddess.

 A console owned by love and death, a mad 
 Being reaching through fear to resilience.









                                                                                                                       
 



 Her husband shouted holding his child 
  sped sharply to the door 
  on the ice dropped her baby.
 
 Her brother struck her, and missed,
  then held her, and took her
  back, haunted.

 For the soul is a kind of singing of

 A curve of jubilance and lace 
 Carving a jagged fallen sky

 Each poem is a protest against comprehensibility.


                                                                                                                       




            from the stone sprouted vines

       at the end, the poem meant nothing
      
      ice cried out
      for help with love lost

The Lines of the Family 
 
 in some seasons we fight, 
 and have to stretch for a guidebook 
 
 wild forest cedars catching 
 cavernous eruptional 
 menacing sunlight, sipping rain 
 for faint fingers of information 








DARKNESS 

 
 is that instinct
 to eat uncertainty
 
 uniforms subject 
 to contradiction 
 
 dead doubts breaking









my hand
scented 
by the sculpture of you

 you, who 
 have peace 

 while for me, hell ascends 
 to settle around the street 
 a sun broken by the morning








 

 what will be done 
 let's make it she
 
 till she cupping 
 an uncontrollable
 alder 
 
 shows him 
 the her 
 in which 
 children 
 will









PLAY 

 
 he lay at her knees 
 and used a smile 
 to tie her hair










hypothetical lilies 
are no way  to care












 i love you for such artless
 steps at my door, like a bee 
 inside a dress, seeking milk 











 men all fear 
    the flesh

 and yet on weekend's torn nights
 after the hydrangea settle
 realize mind's moist transcendence










 
 those steps dreamt 
 
 of a regular gesture 
 of acid tracing a base

 ephemeral ills aching
 as flames in the silt










placed in an ocean 
that sways beneath a confused 
and ungraspable light


	   a map 
	   becomes 
	   an anchor
 







answers beat 
up questions







filtered
subtle animals
with sunny dispossessions 
 
 delight
 in the swamp weather 
 of this generation
 
 smell the former
 rough treasure
 dispenser 

 touch smouldering
 dreary willow's 
 radiant notes 









family troubles
 seeking micro redemption 

 elegantly unannounce 
  pre-determined acts










nothing awakens
the withered mist

its violins dreaming of cauliflower trees, 
the shape of redwoods, a river wandering

 it passes again everywhere 
 sharp lines of cellophane

 a branch of consonant sunsets mixing 
 dust and herbless ash from mercury 









my phone lets sweet rain
 and birds in the deep current 
 remind me of sorrow

 lines shed by the ground
gravity-scented 
  to wake decay
  
 








i watch the shortest sound 
 of darkness, admire me
 on my long way 
 out of nothing










PAIN 

 
 two hundred minutes 
 curve from the leaves 
 that plan the beautiful 

 that happen to erase
 a dispute, or a moment's future

 that dawn simply in birth's objective:

			 to seed space, inside 
			 you, to evade 
			 retrieved language 
			 











in the strange indifference
 of the week's implacable
 bread, each flower was finished

 it's flesh lets the night lie open 
  as it makes the tangled questions

 		    look at every new leaf
 
 







like imaginary milk
she grows softly 
and tries to live






 can you tell me why you now 
 give me this sign, as style?

 snare a robin, drink sand
 & hook nowhere, to matter?





 the idiocy
 my rhythms create 
 
 out of a bit
     of water smells




a butterfly 
licks littoral
sweat off camera  
cargoes folded before a pig









 in the hope of joy 
 i know the same
 dreaming 
 that fingerprints 
 call 'self-expression' 












  there was a moment 
 in great thick socks
  where she decided

			 i can't 
			 let myself 
			 be hurt 
			 








Plunging her hair into rain.
She says: you need to be loved.







 to echo the ocean's light
 the poison of its elms 
 pruning stars

 that reach to her 
 self the trunk 
 of a mistake









 patient blue images 
 wrapped 
 and showered

 i have a cat too 
 that's new 

 and horses, harmless 
 blue figments

 there is a catch: 
  their skins are not locked
  their infusions warm nothing











 
 i kept a cardinal 
 in my inbox 
 shining

 and 
 a few times, 
 i heard or 
 felt its stench. 












 deified 
 did i consider it 
 home? what with the music 
 every morning, and my mockery 
 poured onto the roof, and the buried 
 cold calls of heavy earth's fear

 singing over remnants 
       of synthesizers
 












 the young story's 
 graying ventricles 
 cool into a lone depth

 as she rolled on to catch him 
 flinging cracked borders from the puddle

 and then won his process of choice 
 blushed home, belonging like joy 











 we were busy 
 in the enormous
 hardwood internet forest

 pebble wristwatches 
 gathered around new 
 story feeds left 
 to rot in the sun 
 of public despair











 when anger rains
 human war

 languages 
 of happiness
 are stomped into dust













someone  

 buried a cat
  at a picnic 

     with a banker 
     designing the dull logo 
          of solitude

			 & other young shapes 
			 half-buried by famine 
			 










 moral tongues 
 decivilize dying

 a garland
 of contentious pills 
 
 the pierced shock 
 of a tree

 a night
 silence











  orchids 
  see soul
  kiss trouble










 and the pain 
 of another's company

 noticed in its benediction
 sends thoughts home 










 never greet the lover 
 on the rocks

 or the children 
 between the houses 

 or the fleas 
 on a forbidden sun

 drowning forever 
 in rooms somewhere









 when sweet must come 
 even from a forgetten 
 secret 
 
 and time comes to hold
 the noise of the dead

 as eunuchs come to sunday tea 
 
 and the many fruits 
        of a secret 
 little moon come 

  to willow rip 
  budded feet 
  on the sun 












i want
 guaranteed demands

 laden and hacked 
 at placenta gate











COWARDICE 

 
	the  clock 
		 soon     uncertain
		 disappears   in us











the rubble wildly-wailing 
 shows you its pedigree, writing 
                swamps onto your flesh










 mama insisted 

 on making a corpse
 from the untold tales 
 of fake vagabonds
 
 to roll in a whisper 
 with a keel of silk 

 	where the earth waits crystal still









body was at ease 
 a wind between 
  skin and mirror








 a hero, 
 undestroyed, 
  died, across from, 
      what was mine.










GREAT LITTLE SOUL. 

 
someone carried you
past the private incorporated
 abandoned sweetness 
                     of walls










 an excited pine-tree 
 watches the sky 
 twist augurs of substance 
 into weary tears







Luria's Illnesses 

	kicked the fists
	where songs stab out







ghetto dreams
kill them all:

 ex-jocks, myal boys, 
 hearth lords, fruit elders

  they are not only tongues









 
 peace writes with 
 dissolving stars 
 (all gold) 
 
 a strange bird,
 old and shattered
 rising from its fetus 
 











 implacable vision 
 walking through the stone summer streets
 treading on fissures of crushed oblivion. 

 stoops in glad naked 
 gloomy invented time










 coulee honey. 
 babylon maple. 
 cherry creek.







high-dive 

 i have 
 no blessing or wit, nor 
 pictures of wordly passions. 
 
 i find my way into everything.
 i wish less lives.









 the bible: its delicate wrecked tongues
 rise into the sky, thick with hours, 
 to dance in a shrine at midnight,
 and leak thunder to make many 
 methods of uniform uniforms
 prison dried under stumped
 unknown birds with lips, 
 the music of the prize 
 to tend the state 









fuck the seed fund 
 of faint encrypted feelings







 
 i remember his point. it was to say:
 
 				when i say 
 				nothing, i 
 				learn. 
 
 







 you remember how her fingers would give 
 a wish to what must be unmoved

 you invent the fatigue of light 
 a shadow awaiting soul

 you leave her more and more within borders 
 rinsing her belly with maps and rules

 you seed a garden strewn with unspoken
 rented contradictions












 i nuzzle sea-sands
 that goddess exactly made
 to seek my hand, and there 
 find burdens  become desert 
 a wing of accumulated doubts







 hands gleaming sweat 
 in her bed in the forest







 that long summer
 we dragged the gully 
 light toward the quiet 
 impossible hopes of sparrow-flocks 
 








 a wide rain of fire filled
     an empire with nipples

 a spice of truth sprouted as a garden 
  in your ear, your watched your words 
                    become wind









what shall we gain?
less yearning? 

fragment ragged warning smoke?
 perhaps our solitude?

 and in spite of ourselves 
  the odd gift? 












 i pushed home 
 the closed
 delicate bodies 
 of babel 
 
 being
 a season
 of valleys
 
 bone's positron 
 twentieth-century 
 heart-felt  dogma












	folded asleep 
	 in the core

	 is a word 
	  never 
	   loved









 
the poet fainted 
beneath the moon 

among dull pink and beautiful knives, 
where the earth had fallen out of the dark

	+

 and there is no fate
 in our thoughts 

 they live 
 in fresh smoke
 clearing the engine's glaze










 the lie 
 will die


   glimpsing an orchid 
       carrying a dawn

 









beauty moving on 
 an electrode hill

	 i listen
	 using time 
	 to play 
	 the earth 









 we enter a hard world: 
 everything again 
 waiting  
 
 we burn a rock 
 in the moist speed
 of being born

 we count many pillow-like weeds
 abandoned on the pavement











EVERYTHING 


 rides up to the borders
 gathers around your bed

+

 i feel its all as clear 
 as if i have forgotten all my life, 
 and naive, all is unread, uncanny, following all











 
 Self-Lost


 perhaps time 
 was speaking about a bird, 
 a creek oiseau creature 
 bonded to wet surface
 
 or a hunter 
 serene, knee-deep in water 
 near the river bottom
 that trembles as it rains










 in that garden, 
 the hiss of wood, 
 in circular darkness 
         is incessant










 
 a human gaze hushed
 at the root, alive 
 in a loop 
 of unbearable messages













 time tells me it's not known at all 
 
 it whirls in exhilaration 
        an absent blessing

 a human complaint behind its breast 












 	only flames
 	heed why happiness
 	stitches earth into play

	          to devour love

 









 even slow attention
 now, too, must obey 
 delusion
 











 for something to know what it was
 and hurl the last massive stars
 out of heaven as wasted light

 nobody must be missing











this family cannot flow, and so
  dies in this chair of dust 









 
 being a taste, you have no 
 concerns nor questions to dance












 i know the fresh edge of an invisible
 winter mesh, a liquid wind exploding









 
 the sky you haven't wanted enough 
 the lake of your own crying fists

 that for the miracle you

 return to morsels
 in sharp brine

 breath shine 
 & shadow ash









in the room that comes before day
 place begins longing










 i am reflection 
 spent in pity

 a river of potatoes

 wise familiar words 
 dreaming a distant star

 forlorn hearts
 letting years sing














 
   this song calibration
 has no need for a wound

      blue lime crumpled 
      in the plum  smoke 
 
         books  becoming 
                 flowers

 











NATURE 

 
 no one can think 
   to learn
 
 a mirror spins 
 straining facts
   to love










NEVER FORGET 

 me 








 In The School Of The Birth-moment 


	 waving 
	 writhing 
	 melting 
	 floating
	 singing
	 flashing
	 breaking










 sorrow knows how to hear 
 what time will not tell
 
 







 of all that we most know 
 the law of each other 
 is needed
 









night's sun kept
whispering to god 
to come taste the bile

 the walls of fog sweeping
 over bright screens, tender 
 soft electronic blessings



 








consolation

 and there are no pearls 
 no holy poet's work to loathe 

 just temptations and torsos 
		    rubbing branches
		      over the wrecks 
		       of homeless faces 




 








SHARK


the price of his glittering house 

 the air that lambs him
 in the torn smocks 
 on the blood flow 

 and the shack 
 bleached glow
 cock blunders

 show the heart speech where
 the ocean will be destroyed. 












ALL 

    the grace  of seized
    certainty-free sleep

    is an oddity 
    best-expressed 
    dead











 summer says: of course 
 all things begin free 
 
 in ambitious recurring
 bright days, where sacrifice 
 revives faith for no purpose










STONE 

 
 the disordered moon in the baby is 
 welcome to become, not art nor dust, nor 
 a wrinkled voice, but driftwood, peacock-shrine 
 cut, through the fresh lungs, a lubricity 
 reads, in sadness motes, a meager vitality









 
 he's she? 
 past engines, 
  otherwise extra. 
 
 i have spoken 
 of all the things 
  fucked. 
 
 so it can leave me 
 when it sings wars. 
  we agree. 













 love the world

				 your voice 
				 this moment 
				 is
				 










 in an impossible way 
 life must be 

 faith in a house 
 somewhere shattered











TONGUE 

 and your silent cinema imitation of green 
 photographs and summer rocks 
 drives the sunset to cut 
 water

 you'll exult less 
 when you feel more














distances 
 made in confused cries 
 pluck a stalk of infinity
 
















 love becomes dust 
 grated used-up
 not good for anything

 











 in three 
 enigma-born 
 dream-poems

 a blackbird sits in my hair


 










gate husks the certainty 
of swimming fitful winds 
 
 vents threaten me from the dead contrary
 night with muses fed on uncensored data














 the selfish 
 wind shield

 its eyes barbecue 
 regulations sleep

 its book severs meaning's 
 immutable grief surfaces

 human things 
 hidden in the eyes 
 of fruit












 i love the swampy pear 
 as always, more saint than calf 
 a home saturday once designed 
 
 by hunger's hornbill 
 an art of tiny hands

 my father hates
 any land you live on












DEATH, A HOUND 

 fused blue and cultured 
 eats cutty-shark manure 
 reins of static liberty

 like flat stars within a sacred leaf 
 emptying swans out of a hollow skin 
 
 the everlasting 
 claw of the teeth

 bone-broke
 brainless 















PRIVATE ROOM 

 in the opposite sense 
 is twice cherished, or 
 scrubbed away
 into electron flecks 
 of backbone 
 complaining walls











OUTSIDE i am scared

 flouds 
 mr. folk 
 pariah ether 

 cities dangling
 by the blanket 
 tangent olives

 forgotten hoahwah
 story mesa 
 breeze clocks

 something has happened to x 
 








 a destiny
 body made 
 
 a crossing 
 escapes 
 the tongue 
 
 my board 
 smells of
 nostalgia 
 








my lips 
cascade
melanomas

almond orange
cry clear
looks









 north over fountain's snow-covered winds
 ears strike a supervised precedent

 to disperse the sea's 
 warm seal of hard 
 enslaved cameras










 you hear the house see

 imagining a queue of leftover
 animals linked in sexual 
 chronology










in the arms of this muted 
 loneliness 

 nothing moves 
 micromanaging 
 
 the sudden perseid bones
 of resistance wounds

 and ruelle water
 battered by forty years 
 of artistry










 
 
 sunday, six-hour star, honey, the lone sun.

 death becomes an alchemical favorite
 a big funeral sentimental 

 web buzz raft









Dub nerve chorus 

 the logs are asleep
 and ore a winding intent 
 deep within a chain of houses 
 perceived swallowing light
 snakes in the distant air




















 saw what i say i know

 you land
  inside me 
 like sky 
 
 i forget my eyes 
  to kiss 
 your hands

























 
 
 
 i wept here
 across the milk gates of the factory 
 while my father began to erase 
 money with a mouth-sternum-navel-cleft
















 i have suffered the 
 intimate nerve thoughts 
 of rock dry 
 conspiracies swirling
  wonder














THIN HEART 

 
 here, awake, hold me 
 at your bosom, let no scorned 
 grass politics clanking muffled 
 pierce the salt meadow

 blurred feeling
 wound enough 
 to guess














SPEECH


 enormous hollows flung bright 
 from the pewter array
 pilgrim moment 

	 fear 
	 to sing
	  enthusiasm 
 
 as when i left a pair of dead 
      kids rigid burning

    prayer owner's upheaval 
        after hate 
      made the point in me 
 











 3:49 dawn, always 
 here, i regret
 the wind in her blue coats 
 
 salmon-pink alloy 
 cucucurrucued evaporating










 a fading brightness of horses burns the way 
 sometimes a sun somewhere in america was 
 
 measured in a riderless decline, a 
 sparrow-flock of angels in a plague of suns










militant 
 tongue asking 

 shadow to jump 
 through defeat

 bridges 
 shooting fanged agony
 from honey machines

 pine-dark dogs 
 tar canku rows

 hitching friezes 
 where ancients sleep













I see

 night cause this saying

 what follows spying on
 the effect of the rest

 planted on mountain's peak 
 love demands all-love-forever












time-girdled, imploding
    they wake for love 












don't take him back. right away. 
 flames, like stories, die.













 let love ripen again, 
 let your bones pass over this universe.














 we did not know 
 the glow of things
 the shine that made
 day swallow our paths










dead water
etched into 
 unicorns

  oil-coil & pork-sky dreams
 double-hard, darkening-wild
              snowblue hands











 only nothing 
 the feeling to be
 such separation















		 we are born
		 stalking 
		 last-gasp 
		 lust










 raw pods of rainbow hair




 
 old meals 

 my soul already wanting to lift 
 nowhere,          bent barefoot 
 by the fence          with rain. 
 











every wave 
 is a model
 logic farms














 mankind sustains abominations 
	 money-hungry and happy








 orchids to pencils
 one antiquated dot 
 
 rare charity 
 in violet harm 
 bridges  crime
 
 one hour of such надо, raised a way 
 of casual birds, a beard addressing napalm







					 we have forgotten
					 we were raised 
					 to pause













 i love how you watch the glass 
 that separates me from
                the photograph












 sin. 
 
 i, the falcon, 
 planted the southwest
 scratched soil 
 flew trembling thru fog











mind is a smudge


oxygen wax 
 
 veins 
 in the bleachers 
 of the visual propeller

 peasantry car meat

 misery piers 
 ninja planets








 
 
 i sit at home 
 a sky in a photo
 
 a sliver of flesh
 burned with light 

 brandishing 
 nothing
 
 an adamant singing
 declaring  the sun 
 











 my story is 
 like a voice
 which sings 
 when it cannot











 sit, cry no longer, find 
                      a calling

		robot offers 
		ignite answers

		we are mattered 
		   fate rhythms









Sipping on Estrangement 

 
 he sighs over early-closed flaws
  contextless phone calls missed
  flights that stopped the fruit of together 
 








 sicken 
 silent 
 sad

 even though 
 the world 
 is planned 
 similitude 
 
 paper-thin 
 self-effacing
 lost dreams
 come to smother
 happiness









 beautiful men thresh flora diamondine 
 impolite free sandstone parcels
 
 where the headland pliant 
 satisfaction bore deep scars






 
 i'm not saying we're right 

 stone lifts naked
 magazine oil egos

 a punished bird 
 unbeheld morphs 
 into silk blood









 love struggling
 along the field

 redeeming gestures
 of ochre sea-spray

 winter's precise 
 guarded  amazement







in the womb 
 of manhattan 
 scattered on gloss 
 between pine and snowy wires

 anguished yum 
 on fluted agave's 
 discarded pavement 
 











 big and clear 
 wrapped in ignorance 
  
 i count things 
 i am  dreaming










 the future slid preying on us 
 in the peak of the dawn light








 archived orphan tumours
 cut home in whore steps







 a never-ending winter
 opened the long odors
 of an impending  song








	 language 
	 throttled
	 trees










death-spasm
twist of stars
ate dog time 
 
 wept
 a button
 spurting









 mouth ranged into the street
 whirling translucent in the hope 
 of some other







  people told dead 
 heaped empty webs 
       sloth yarns











 our hearts returned to 
  weather the fallen 
  debate of the floor

 recalcitrant 
  rings screwed in 
  narrow undulations

 burning cliffs 
  silently pitted 
  with gas bridges










 hiss light 
 and cure kin 

 whistle at the guard of blood 
 
				          when 
				 chance laughs
				   death feels










 

 i toss love down
 i get up

 even the sound of god 
 ignores me

 i build a table from the horizon










by your slurried window, 
 the only place you never are

 rabbits listen, and  
 a great stone spasms 

  birthing a shy 
 inner metaphysical  
 springtime









 
 dawn 
 commandos oil
 the formalist you 
 
 ah, the sum of homes 
 
 a cloak of paper bowing among mangroves 
 a desiccated summer glowing in the wind

 asleep with swans










like the doctor
 whom the words ash 
 in cargo

 i lean 
 to thrill
 disguised

 meditation 
     bridge 
     crumbs 
 










 a mole attitude
 blooms in the real poem

 a statuette of rain
 a pet kept by a crowd










 
 
 i have not always been   
   what i was, so i am happy
   when they come, and we is sick. 
 
 we have you, they think 
    to wake without, and 
    soap the mountain.
 
 i want to talk to you with you
   until you forgive me.

 w/out u, i'd have 
   no birth at all 
      no childhood.













 the enigma 
 of this leaf bloom
 cures the backyard

 what's to come after the house
 expiration? you do not want details
 about it: that last need of being

 you hide yr pain in pride's moment 
 taste a future known only in symbols











 a seer furled 
 becomes hush endless

 offal, a friend
 caught in a vinyl mirror

 a rage of telegrams; a legless 
 animal burning; an invisible 
 floating rock










she wants an inflammable 
 scrap horse in bed

he knows any good aggragates
 will be sent ill-luck

she notices courage's small legs swell
 as she touches him, he blinks shuts











why tell them 
 everyone is ravaging nothing

 foreshadowing neglected
 synonyms weaving 

 a pulse of lakes 
 i need to watch you -- 
 














the worst 
 is love 

 that deflection daoist 
 poet held like the pen

 void, unwanted 
  human nature

  united with the floor
  you are taken and cry













 summit of contractions 
  those odd antique stones groping 
     a row of afterthoughts 

     	 +
		 
		 i fetch a false arrow 
		 and sow  power

		 to save one mocked
		 bulging
		 strangeness











 adversaries thread 

				      a trance for 
				 imprisoned
				   fledgling trees
				  
	soil swaying 
	 like molten bones

	     bread hardened 
	           into words

		        walking dusk 
		           into desolation














 every day a woman 
 passes through a dark alley 
 of industrial beech light 
 
 touching the apple-red agaric wings 
 washing a glossy hare in horikoshi mustard 
 
	 sipping resveratrol
	 to awaken the heart











 nature

 tells someone 
 about anywhere
 
  nothing fails













		    bless me empty
		          softened
		             heavy

    in a throbbing chair
          of blood hunger

 something burns the grace 
  of eternal loss, becomes
       a polyphonic canker














Being answers


 a cage with no retreat 
 a bowl of sturdy moments

	    & wonder
	    goes on 

			    before they 
			    declare you

			    	   over












 i will open 
 a holiday 

 at a little distance
 from unlistening

 and touch
 only the almost 
 beautiful enough

 at the edge of the poem
 offer weeds as gifts













    acumen
 describes
 the night

 rescues moist
  bravery, and shakes
    
    as thirty pills shoot 
    a wire into awareness 

 
 







in the covenant of women 
 a path quickens

		   all afternoon 
		        it rains 
		 
      each place falters 
   catching the light

 dying to display desire 
         or lack thereof 










 beauty

 physiological 
       in time
    not heaven

 wakes a handful of confessions

 stands, letting midnight
 play within it, grinning










 a flutter 
 of rendition
 speaks of god 
 
 as if he or she were alive
 in water striking literature 

 no duplicate 
 tasks to improvise 
 
 not even death,   marked 
				   to talk 
				   to this spot 
 
 nothing makes it the word 
 of my seizures  against 
 the stillness of hope 
 
               past 
             space 
          implies 
     endorphines












 one lover's back
 pulls holes from
 the field's sand 

 damp with empty blood




	 life juice
	 locked within light
	        shakes stars
	 
	  unflattering hills 
	   flail into prayer 




 a trough
 of lovers call
 feelings a mistake 
 
 their glittering 
 squinted jurisdiction
       sublimates care 
 













 two blossoms 
 turn bed
 into garden 

 book 
 a pulsing sky
 within water


 undulant
 accursed
 moments

 full thrill 












we talk 
 what others
     think










 a kiss is
 a cardio problem

 stitched 
 felt 
 satellite lines

 indignity
 whiffs of emotion

 a mud echo 
 shut into the hours 
 beneath slang










Inside
silence

 beyond 
 what i am thinking

 i am alone
 and will never be born


			  time eats 
			  the words 
			   of worms













come, speak me

life will still 
be just this 
 








 
 as stars spent
 words they could not 
 feel

 their green hands
 cut odor

 all i have done
 at last, becomes
 a stem











the shape of doors

 remind me of wheat 
 beneath the plumage 
 circling echo

 a narrow nadir 
 open and tuned

             a gun 
           inside the shed
          smearing shadows











 hoax children
 no longer turn
 stones into air 
 









 i sit on salt 
 my mother said

 phlegm, so necessary 
 only a wretched scent of sleep
 belongs to higher things










she runs home
to the soft-conched bush

to explain how the child 
 didn't like me, and how it

 means nothing because
 i am listening to you 











to eat is to be known, to get 
     glittering self nectar 
    from flesh meditation 
 
   to remember what
 you must see, perhaps 












 

 
 beautiful anemones
 
	   sounded 
	   wounded 
	  confused

			   only if 
			    you go

			     hours 

	   bell
	   sweat 

	  on sunlit ground
	  in full-unfolded

	       riff stroke madness












	 for       me 
	 here forever 
	 it was rough 

	 loud    silk 
	 sweet spikes 
	 mist pattern 
	 
	 crow  paralyzed 
	 highway chladni
	 harp reservoirs
	 
	 dirty    harm 
	 death darling 
	 plink    wood

	 tinging prime 
	 dis-obedience 
	   










 could we have said, 
 again, what 
 is precious

 what the sagacious 
 howled small cynical
 great narratives 
 had convinced
 the mother 
 blubbered mind 
 to like

 and to borrow my ear 
 so we might 
 shut in them 
 the beautiful
 feeling pieces










 it starts in the morning 
  out of the heavy-winged 

 veins of
   reason:
 
 
 the first 
    singing 


     +


	 behind me 
	 a thing is
	    kneeling

	 unable to keep 
	      any secret 
	 within its reach 












 
 
 in one bones 
        again 
 there is rock

	 & a tree 
	 eating
	 a potato

	 a chair
	 covered 
	 in honey

	 a sparrow
	 on a bus
	 smiling












 in the morning two days later 
 blue sounds strike the valley
 
 and with judgments crack
 what has always been invisible
 









 when a dream shifts 
 its position 
 
 it shreds the whine 
 of inherited stones









 she lies on her back in the field 
 and feels the screams from the city
 eat into her beautiful ears








germinations
 turn death 
 into sex







microbial sympathy routine








 like the heart of a lake 
 we are wounded with time

 bound by blood's secret
 dust of favorite things 
 
 bright
 quarrelling
 valley











THERE IS NOTHING IN ME. 

 except pandas
 stirring empty 
 unknown shadows

 lovely ink of blatant
 transparent fleshless 
 copious corpse clouds 

 motor virgins of lichen 
 whispering that the body 
 destroys what she planned 
			 
		amputated wings 
		in an abandoned cradle











 a hope i thought i achieved
 toiling in the alley  
 
		 like a trip 
		 without baggage











 to thank the mess, she said, is not right

 maybe its a favor to drown
 what life shows in books 
 
 i hate to find this page in my body

 printing me till i live to explain
 how-to become old, die without fret 










Spring frowns and falls 
 towards the world 

 crowded with yarn
 irrigation light

 a robocounter
 in the fields 

 a beach 
 sparkling 
 
 arms and breasts
 appearing from folds

 dirty clouds
 budding taut  
 drench the sea 










 mercy passed on the next book 
 of those not speaking love -- 
 
 we know that they stayed small, optically- 
 positioned to pull in the breath of people










freedom is what nobody is:
 a core absent mystery 

a gleam sewing faces into inaction
  as if there is not enough to do 

plastic tape-roll peeling rocks 
 to reveal little meatlockers 









this strange 
summons visits
    every brain
 









in that ancient room-- 
 there was something 
 the opposite of home

 an answer snail, 
 a pentagon econolodge 
 a mad silly translation of time
 a chimney before dawn, a trickle of cold
   loam pointing with your whole hand
   			  toward fermented windows
















ballad's concussion 
 concludes in drool

that's the way it is 
 it licks anyone who looks 













 
 do you even see me? 
 when i am not in bed? 
 
 and do you see your mother's 
 fingerprints in my mouth?

 and the petals on your neck 
 trembling with rules?
 
 and the sparrows 
 in the swamp 
 carving hopes?

 or the sun 
 playing ancient cellos?












Some of that rain
 stabs reveries 









 
 a foot-path for what is crushed 
 a pure horror gulag fountain 
 
 every grandmother runs through it 
 












NOTHING 


 we saw eyes dream

 in home-sick skin jails 
	    
	    wrappers, 
	     greater than any 
	   distance, thought 
	      around the body 















Woman God


 let's be clear
 each day is a lever


	     the naked church
	      refuses to take grief 
	         into the machine 
 












 
weeding self-pity
 

 black cars moved 
 over a sagging cloud 












Last Tone From The Ancient Fabric Of A Child


 curling on her lap, the hush 
 of oak trees, a silver trout 
 with winged horns, and a soft    rain 

           thoreau shows how narrative
              floating awake like that
 cryed for years in the blue sin











Where We Stand

 today we gave our money
 to feed one life

 our emotions weighed
 our replacement 

	 we held the deep 
	 paths of the wind 
	  
	    to make sure  
	    united chaos 

	 wasn't a transitory 
	 lotus breakthrough










 pills by sour peaks. 
 my neck calligraphy.
 
 unwilling bread sculptures.
 rooting mountain poster rock.











 the end is filled

 its ample hands 
 hovering over bright snow

 its white horns rolled 
 in cellophane startled 

 touch sheets of sludge
 from the dryhtlic dance-off










 joke rage
 
 
 before that 
 at the point 
 at which i'm still 

                     here 

    people's skin
    devious amid melting fists 
         ate buckets of births










 restless stuff
 absolves disorder

 what is it i mean by this? 

         i harvest foliage 
         that burns my heart

			 i am
			 a sinking boat 
			 on a locked tide
			 









 
 
 we won't trick minds
 
 or ascend
 with touch 
 to join the stars 
 when you die

 	





		   complicated fumes 
		   root in numb fire














chant 
love
each day

sing a spectacular music 
outstretched in the grasses

forget your animal body consumed 
by light expanding fogiveness









music on the floor, 
 poised asleep on the edge outside of things 
 in some place  where molten

 mosquito rock 
 intelligent shows
 possibility pity










 my heart eats ashes 
  others love me 
 
 i like it at home
 i have these analogies

 i feel lulled in with sides
 a еспредельщик contigous grin 
 
 a solace that stares as it grows











angel 
 of structure, i fall like a tear 
 into torture ditch code: 
 c,d,d,b,b,a,b,a,a,c,b,b,b,c,b,d,b,d,c
 
 i see the hunter pushed, head up 
 into the bathroom, preening. 

 i hear you shut the takeout box
 that bears my name
 heaped before the tv













 whitman's fake appetites
 make the x listen back









in the golden hotel 
 eating cake 
 despair gates
 
 clockwork cusp of sycamores 
 lined up, yawning, seduced,
 lost in wonders' fibrous machinery

 endless anomalies
 dusting the dross 










 1000 amber deaths, & a little wind 
 set out to remember lyric stone 
 debtors' trysts, power salience











bitter future anaphor
 
 a forgotten echo
 bare and for sale

 a vast sweaty
 stolen wild residue

 fading bereft
 limp salt rim

 ruins 
 sufficiently used
 becoming archives













during this dance 
  sky cracks 

  and lust
  (a rubber ducky)
  watches 
 
			 tyrant-haters 
			 gang-fight 
			 










 
 i. 
 
 the countless salt 
 in everything


 ii.

 a word, a tiny word, 
 round as mercy


 iii.

 a lifetime lit 
 by speckled rags 













 after the perfection of the feast 
 we were not supposed to note loss 
 
 or brick-strewn trickle grapes 
 sagging where payrolls whisper







 i remember the sounds of heaven within the whale 
 








 and so the waif 
 (sheathed chasing 
 crowded water) 
 watched the village breach

 clamouring with time 
 at the entrance to a velocity 
 where expectation slipped

 
 
 





infinity sometimes
is a danger 
tearing despair 
from the pattern-book of dream






the true road was commotion 
 an overgrown aim 

 behold my mind by the sea. your 
 side under my mouth, succumbs. do 
 i create you? ready root glare 
 of my body, an email flood 
 that tries to let light in






 thread distances
 before they pass 








 open the chaos

 a flying tongue
 squeezing language

 				

 let relations 
 come home 
 to illumination 









evanescenct war


 imagine tomorrow 
 just received 
 an unreal fever  










long ago now 
 a secret mood 
 hid behind 
 an abscessed hand 
 
a suffering god palsied 
 with wrongs
 became the land
 as it rained












 p. placing her hands 
  on the lyric and tubes 
  of stone
 
 remembers the singing 
   wind, hanukkah 
  cleopatra intercession
  pleasure

 shoots my lap 
  flute, that curse of father's 
  jagged letter savanna 














FRANTIC 

 stirred and fragrant as any dream 
  reaching she reverts me

 we spoke for a moment
  left 
   in love 
 
 for this is the year
  we pass the heart sirens 
  bleeding pause 
 
 the pale impossible noticed 
  bronze-gold spaces

 the ribs that fill this bed 
  with song-book hammer valleys 
      beating dirt into smiles 













the paralyzed priest 
remains undiscouraged 
 
 Idomeneus singing until
 the flower of heart's 
 caress scatters 
 

         beauty holds 
          a cold bell











 river tore 
 around the bricks

 ushered and scrubbed 
 past the meditation 

 up to tree 
 on a fjord 
 to warn you 













having seen fear
invoke drama

 i watched in distress 
 my teenage txt recede
 into gutted emptiness
		 
		 ancient words
		 waiting in the sea 














 reboot all installer code
 awake as a lifeless alert

 










 you're the first thing i saw:
 the scent of grief, fresh-washed

 useless grime enclosing
 a weakness amphitheatre

 honey-suckle's embryo trench












 morbid grass on dead 
 clouds moldy sloshes 

 the decaying nameless wise shadows 
 and the reflections of the welcome 

 a clique of suspended penetration



 





Utfus


dolphin mustard with milk 
of rum and pale summer wood 
 
 frogs around the altar
 the fingers of a child

 a yak-hair table
 at the heart of yes





 
 biased thought      making 
 a rainbow from lawn chairs








I Wish To Be Closed In The Intimacies Of Love
	 

	 a pool open 
	 to the bottom of history 

	 children floating
	 on fluted rain 
	 
     the deep cream of an unerring land













until 
 time-lapse pollen and water-clock care 
 swarm regret visionaries in a chorus
 of flesh-traded brand-new raving

mouth 
 will release  a shadow 
 of sewers among swamps 













 because they were screwing 
 on our hairy chairs 

 and splintered particles
 were escaping through 
 a fine hole facing a fire
 
 rages, disenfranchised, 
        conjoined cliffs 
 











 get upon her 

 spread and drunk 
 crammed in

 clinging to a weight of coffins











 where ashes 
 never-living

 softly beat
 a disturbed task 
 












		with a frown 
		full of honey 

		 i surrender
		 to a past 
		            
		    where passions 
                imagine me 
















 john cool gasps,
 grasps twilight black

 blue ashtray glass, picks
 green flowers shooting

 hidden among 
 green stalks. wakes 

 everyone who won't enter 
 the beauty. the ceremonial

 celadon paths that run 
 to see coyote flaws spring












 
 solitary huckleberry 
 in the bright bottom of the void










 
 Fleece-hustle Taste

 I summon ash, pine-forests 
 and bubble-awe high-risk flocks











a flame rare, endures, nothing 
but a cataract of foam-flecked talk
that cries out, upright and massive
for the troubled stink of sleep











the house they dragged 
 out of the daylight 
 talked 

 









 clay
 argues with the moaning
                     sun 
 







 
 i think  of glitch
 sex prairie wolves

 tattered     books
  
 who seem to write the fool 
 and kiss     the nest home













 xiii 

 i cannot dream you  
 beauty   diseaseed
   smooth in my bed













 orchestra isolation 
 without ambition's mushroom
 cut bones into the color of isms










  
 poetry flows in joy 
  above what moans 

 all climb her 
  light 

 to drink warm 
  wine 

 and gaze at 
  bearded spines

 huddling in the brain 
  leaking wet cochineal spice














waves
 a broken ledge 
 a pool of bright fronds 
 a jail bulletin
 a metronome 
 a death-note 
 












 in this model
 the ground
 doesn't matter

 and life floats 
 toward loss
 leaving lullabies 














folded breath

 approaching a wall
  of mild appropriated 
   saturation

 peak
 transparency

 where words
 scratch self 
 with speech milk













 so often dust like the feet
 of an illegal tree 
 comes to spill the muses












 
 this afternoon 
 all the sunlit 
 songs of water run 
 toward cool mute twilight



 
 








 
 devil's muscle draws
 empty cream, brick 
 jockstrap roar 
 and hungry skulls 
 quiet and young

 that's the wisdom 
 of this dead thistle














Forewarned In His Sleep, Honey-Gold Baby Worked For Me 


					 to smash 
					 the mottled now












birds belong 
 to undulation songs

 a repertoire of moves 
  arisen in accident 

















 i am ur-cantos, 
     uncountable mock-solar-flares

  “peace” clamped to saran-wrapped 
 inmates in mass-market holes of fate

 		let us wash this ground and go on
 














despairing and incomplete 
 in a lonely cage of gentian
  skin       drifting 










	 torrents of dna

	 scuffed ledges 
	 where lambs 
	 feather mouth 
	 cinnabar fields












 angry are their paths thru the games 


 sounds are dry here, their souls 
 mandela in america

 death is the shadow truth 
 of meat, apollo's peace 
 
 now even when they can will it,
 and even if they shield a heart,
 they are alone, lost in steps





 






 a post-hypnotic score
 weight 

 reading her pattern
 shudders











CHANGE TOO LATE

 
 on the last crucial rail of light, 
 the void does not see the vaulting
 turning air, nor cities folded 
 as they lie at home, dwelling in
  venus' orbits














 adorned duress 
 inside gown albatross

 arranged red tents 
 and stonecrop unities

 reverence the way 
 they're mutilated 












 they listen on these nights  
 to an elegant shift

 forgetting the tracks 
 inside the interface

 they want to be 
 platform sediment 















i smell code 
 assert blood















WORLD 

 
 opened his past 
 perfect eye 

 his team impossible 
  lowland  enclave 
 of pompous clothes

 his mint weather-hen 
  swirl of dappled bowl 
 executive-proved awakenings









 together at a picnic 
 of pastel-drawl deeds
 and sensitive velvet-ice









 
 show me, once you've fallen too far, too long 
 in blue, through my dream where mother hidden 
 and free shines, while dad hearing me, writes not 












 a mind in pain i am 
 tearing at cherished words

 the body's fresh rewards 
 scarcely felt as growing 














 Kerygma 

 in the latitude of the way, they choose 
 to sleep, letting the law of things
 pack white wet privilege 
 
 we enter with those folk, 
 bound in the name of you. 

 to sing: i am digestive soul 
 perched numb on an old wise song
 for i ask nothing out of love 













 
 every spring must
 kiss the stream 
 bent with snow 

 prisoners without feeling
 rinsing the valley in a knot
 of enflamed breath
 
 










 
 i am smoking a persistent nazar: 
 a field encompassing maps, colony- 
 lines, slave-reading light as it grazes 
 its primary-braid of north snow-gestures










 Calm always deep Hyperion
 is an island stuck 
 in sherbet like a shell 
 inhaling regret tallow 










 sick driving
 a plastic code
 and the perfume 
 of crackhead matrix 
 cornbeef jumps stinking 
 over her high birthday skin
 hernia leashed to altar-stains 
 











 a muse calls to its peers: 

	 an om orb, at home in the market, 
	 a resilient heart thicket,
	 a thin statue, bare-legged,
	 a guest, thrown out, pacing 
	 chronos who sells ringing

	 nothing filled when alone 
	  believing knows












 
 
 i hear obedience weeping
 swallowing gravel

 as the cold old one waking 
 says: what is broken is bad















 Perhaps They Crawl


 to lecture the carnival flower 
 to rust the chilled reptilian cicadas 
 to leap-frog monuments 
 to chide dewy plates floating like flax

 in these a kind of gratified order has happened













Who Came To Shit Visions and Desire?


 Poetry with a beautiful mouth 
 cheating the sunset out of pain













Hard Flower 

 
  a tree's child
  calls a rock 
  to the agitation 
  of vegetable touch















 now i am chalk.

 and i regret to be
 the yesreaderyes -- that 
 heart anecdote taken from me

 i'm old and rare and torn
 
 and i am sure voice now realizes 
            sound is an acid jail.


















 We Number It 
 
 
 iii 
 
 and point the mountain's lines 
 and swarms of autumn
 toward my dad's hut

 where he said i thought 
 it was what you wanted. 
 
 i cannot taste you, 
 the way the cherry relaxing 
 tastes voices or analogies 
 as pieces of african rock, 
 sea-gull, doorbells, or grape.
















 in between, friendship
 was a difficult love story

 slow endeavours 
 to access her belly 
 to dry her eyes

 i am not talking, nor am i waiting 
 to see perhaps if it fits 
 explicitly in this impeccable














 racing with breath 
 in perpetual pain

 guarded like emptiness

	 remember 
	 that god 
	 is looting

	 quiver
	 sufficiently perished -- 

	 inherit yourself 
	 
	 there is no zero here 
	 




	







 
 time engulfed us 
 to nibble this willow 
 
 bed 
 deep
 swells

		 the significance 
		 of a misplaced heart
		 in a fierce tent of ribs
















I Am Writing To 

 the bullets & the windows

 water is too confident 
 nothing is empty 
 
 i've no room for that














 spider 
 listens

 opening 
 love 

 as it instructs 
 soft dismal knowledge

 to imagine
 living exiled 

 among stories
 of a sea-worm soul














dawn fields

 kicked upward laughing 
 at their own flood

 constricting the smell of snow
 to where shining first went


















Mind By This Clay Breathes
 

 unconstructed and ensouling, clear. 
 windy and numb, reversing. 

 later a landscape is spined out of it, 
 a victimized bump, and desire below, speaks.



















The Last Bliss 


 those bright lines 
 in our spine
 are silence

 i am kept
 in a movie 
 in a coffin 
 in the gutter
 in slender sounds
 suspended over a lake












 my third instinct
 through a graceless
 angel cyclone cuts holes 
 into angry infinite blues













 shadows sang 
 to the holy woman

 her wounded hair
 seized the gate

















I Close My Face On The Stems


 a photo of candles 
 on the path
 where i am born 
 
 air shining 
 by the box of answers 
 in a summer room 
 
 i am eating 
 the sound 
 of a heart
 to calm the moon
















 

 the song's air
 supposed the wrong thing 
 
 sliced the tender
 last book
 
 shaped a picture
 with rules
 
 made time
 wiretap space

 removed
 our content 















 the scent of things in things 
 holds a serious bitter radiance

 body's mind, light-footed as nothingness,
 promised an entire cloying rumored lice-oil
                    love    reconfiguration

















 for what is not is what is 
 in the hole day forever whole
 
 head must break off hand 
 to choose an hour 

 draw on a puddle 
 of faded butter 
 a rumor of the sun














i will write three short dreams today. 
 
	 
	 in the first: i touch a prurient 
	 cheese, then purchase a nose. 

	 second: rivers run inside walls
	 looking, unsuccessfully, for windows

	 third: a blossoming lignum-vitae
	 offers a sauce of pleasure
	 to dead ruined letters 











melody believes in meat 
 
 darkness hard 
 revolution fossils 








how does one paint grief 
 on the elegance of the infant








Light Was Wasted On Us


 the night is full of comments 
 
 all-new roaches 
 fluffing death

 my heart is thinking how 
 i miss your presence











 balance laughs 
 a secret joined 
      to progress











 convergences leak 
 a precocious blood-lust

 as naturally as one might
 hold a howitzer 

 i was saying 
 this always 
 in bed 











 
 There Is No Therapy Now


 liberty, dying, receives a future
 melody written to forget

 wrought in the garden heart
 haunted by the climbing

 boastful 
 celebrities, choking 
 inside discards bags 











 forests and darkness
 require guns

 beloved curieux 
 madness 
 under the oaks

 toys disappearing 
 in a roar of primeval
 being

 while in many minds 
 some interior kind prometheus 
 constellation scuffed
 construction star
 burns in the shadows 
 
 and at the edges of it 
 is what i am not sure 
 











it once seemed 
that wisdom came out of each word
and phenomena sang a rainbow 

 how is it that the poetry of miracles 
 understands substance as a barren 
 shuffling of books and roots?











 phony corrupt
 gushing counselors 
 breed juxtaposed 
 on the table

 river 
 light 
 faces 
       the ocean

 we wake 
 to go again










 i am happy as i chant 
 past suicides 

 gesturing at glands
 broken in me



	  like me 
	 the grass 
	 brings in 
	 a body 
	 sometimes 

	 awakened 
	 to hear
	 the hidden
	  free i 











hungry songs 
in your etymologist 
 crown leap out 
 remarried 
 same-sex 











  talkers ween with fear
  the south lawn studs 

 patiently vague
 worksong raw 

 swimmers who
 deceptive glitter 
 among thrush waves

			 plankton
			 solace 












 there's a vein 
 in this song, a zeal 
  useless
 chrysalis of silence












 
 limbs. 
 i remember, 
 one.










 under the feast pulse
 in the mouth of nothing

 above humpback rhythms where
 people sign crosses, my father

 plays with a beautiful
 quiet bivalve of doubt

 a wind full of foxes and pebbles 
 flashing cuticles of saint thigh 
 








yet you
 found what you sailed for 
 to hide the clearing, no need 
 of doubt, no need to end 
 in your centre stone pain









And Die 

 to have a choice, to live 
 cling to paved wanderlust

 play the tender sheaves 
 of their graves

 a packet of warm blood 
 and blind abdomen lice 
 crying up from the sea











Our Witty General Woes



	  diamond unperplexed 
	 she spends her language 
	  expiating rotating cages 












 the light smells
 bent-winged 
      of crimson
        dreaming












 at the end 
 drawing dust 
 on the face 
 of fantasy









Your Metal Be Done 
 

 grief (like bees)
 redeems an archipelago
 inside a mirage






 
 tyrant flux







 the room stands

 	physically 

      	when i fall






 a bird in the asylum
 its mouth leaks home







 you are born enough 
 no doubt you can be      beautiful

 








 my body is sutured labyrinths
 a love nourishing mind thirst







NEW 

children emerge from the wreck 

				 flaw ordained 
				 pinioned dead 
				 rumour poised











Grief Circles Forgotten Trees


 what i can't remember 
 of this place 
  sings itself

 outside there is 
  a dog, a beach,
  stones, a console, 
  a highway, planes.












 and we are hungry, we say 
 for the ideogram devotion 
 
 we discuss, it is assumed,
 the cold balcony shit god









 a little moment
 migrated into fingers 

 & ha! 

 flow by ashen
 contemplation 
 
 oak united naked 
 damp water smoke

 to love the seizure 
 wit broken entrance

 i remember the word 
 laid hot to sweeten











 so people went to the prison 
 the racist ruined black wind

 the fresh emblem of the wandering echos 
 a gap gurgle stew of twine turbid doors 











Hate The Same 


 i almost wanted to do this 
 to hear you talking

 but no, i live my name
 enumerating 
 its couplets, ignore 
 my tongue 

 until i am a glock swat 
 invitation 
 halting wounds












Toothless Sextalk


 husk drawn to the sludge
 lips, rewarded with rain 
 
 overcome by dust
   engines unfold










 a starved whim gently stands
 wrapped in possibilities







 for troilus, the year  
 during which i'm dead 
 was dangerous










i hold a zen love
 spun

out of perfect insects
 shuddering in the wind 
 
 i draw my cedar back to wine: 
  ripening  satisfied













You Woke

 
 summer dawns 
 inside bread 
 & wild grass

 long skies 
 drunken butterflies 
 cream whispers 

 sound makes us 
 dwell and fall

 







tender sticky and open

	you stand 
	  at the rose door
	and crawl inside

 Febris

 Think of the fertile poor 
 And old humble hubris



	
           


	 
 A rainbow's heart loosed everywhere
 A stale ceremony  of heaven drowned.




	
                                                                                                                       

 
 
 
 In this world 
 I am one of the arguments.
 
 


	
                                                                                                                       

	 

	 The heart is the dead 
	       air of the soul



	
                                                                                                                       


	 
	 The Messenger 
	 
	 Is the dead one who is born.
	 She is the first of the sun.




	
                                                                                                                       


 In the heat of the heart of the thing 
     I find grass in the sky
         and water at a place of storm
 
 

	
            







	 Cold white and absolutely red, 
	 The tortoise air used to speak
	 What need counted in the heart

		 The eyes of the gods  
		 Hidden in a dark sun








	
        





		kelp covered the mess 
		on my side of the bed

		it was in love with 
		  my mother's 
		     unseen eyes





	
                                                                                                                       



Oh, I cannot say how to seek feeling 
And not the pain that is summer to gods.



	
                                                                                                                       


The Golden Wheel of the beautiful
 	       it's a simple business. 
 
 Yellow leaves reflected in blood. 

	 The future 
	      dumb as a stick vulture.

	              A dawn bursting. 



	
                                                                                                                       



	 We are laid 
	     in the overwhelming book 
	     in the blue-green storm. 
	 
	 The place that is always involved 
	 In the words that are life, listened. 

	 


	
                                                                                                                       


	You 

 Earth's green arcade of reason 
 Sprouting in the hot winter
 Glimmering ideas strewn in blown water

	Abhorre

 I hold the dark full (glass eucalypt) onanist
      downward defiant drenched drooping erect
    				        droning brain-dead 




	
                                                                                                                       


 When celebration
  took flight
  some practice stored 
  enough for servitude.

It penetrated some wounds: 
  outbound, bodyisms 
  humid deities, hairy passions,
  faked daffodils.



	
                                                                                                                       



 Fretum castoffs, breast-bone-bots; 
             meat-links,  vida-fortuna,
 puzzling cavities,  work-cot water-jets. 


 Truly, this love wears itself.

 
             Narcissus: condensed quiet 
  jewel of newly-enlightened enthusiasm
   -- a difference where every envelope 
                               vanishes.



 Rung and handled, you don't know how 
 Inserting Titanic into the network's 
 framed breathlessness taunts Styria. 




	
                                                                                                                       


	A raft of milk 
	   the size of a bird 

	     a Death—Sharp magician 
	     a Stygian Bridge Sleeping
	  
	 I saw the soul of my own hand was sweet. 
	 You ate me.
	 We felt the pleasures of the earth and death. 
	 



	
                                                                                                                       


On the mute side of the shop 
 no money would have been born. 



	
                                                                                                                       

 
 And the long bright order of their eyes 
 Came on the uprising of heroic mysteries 
 And now they are an annual product of time.
 


	
                                                                                                                       



 long anguish, all over the world
 the vast soiled trembled roaring

		 	love made things
		                      die


		            tragic warmth
		             glistening
		           means the tomb




	
                                                                                                                       



	 Crotch-of-moss
	 multi-track loop

	 I kill it now. 
	 Ardor, reawakened, jerks.

	 The sea said:

	 I was one of the Old Mountains, 
	 And a young man at the end of a war. 
	 
 The world had no doubts about the woods.

		 A cold rain 
		 Fell on white 
		 Empty branches.

		 


	
                                                                                                                       




I touch the long mirrors of an abstract land 
	 
		    and the crotch 
		   of my dry heart

	  a little rag of fern

 A Rite

          The night    is gone
called to penance by all women
pulled with love into the eyes 

			  a long &  lovely 
			  coiling    juice 
			  enters its heart 
			 
	 --  she will not know why 
	 
	 
	 
	 
	 

	
                                                                                                                       




	 
	 Blood  
	  wildly 
	  ungratefull
	   riots. 
	 
 All falls in heaven 
     down to the end. 
 
 Trees open graves in walls. 

 Serene boats shine 
 Shouting in a wind 
     that we unfold. 






	
                                                                                                                       



in the old lovesick meadow
 lepers died 

   like soft 
   tumbling necromancer
   darkness




	
                                                                                                                       



Death shines, 
	 See there:
	 It skirmishes. 
	 
	 Rare and loaded with fake silk laughter 
	 It queries  the Lamb's sun-pure  Beyond.


	
                                                                                                                       




 cilia opening
 hazy throats:

 compromise scrap, feather:
 emptying the compact life. 

 Pocket-watch goodness. Wistfully 
 Outside us, waits, and crucifies
 Wants' dishevelled circuitry bed.





	
                                                                                                                       




I am the only one of the one who has left me 
	 

I am the one who is not the one who loved me

	 In Memoriam A. H. H. OBIIT MDCCCXXXIII: 5 
	 
	 
	 As morning springs so quickly from the ground, 
	 Light's song flowers in the meadow's long hair.

	 We no more hear the stars once so long there, 
	 And the faintest reeds of summer's wide wave.

	 A soft warm air heavy with the sun's breath 
	 Touches the eastern hills with slow showers 
	 Wet woods rush to cover the crumbling hills. 
	 





	
                                                                                                                       





		Ghost 
	 was the second one 
	    to make a clock

			 and now it 
			 is the one

	   written in the forest 
	 by the light of the sun 
	 as it mourns the moment





	
                                                                                                                       




	 They are born in their graves; 
	 Their bodies need and make destruction. 
	 



	
                                                                                                                       


	 
	 CHRONOS 

	 The light of birds 
	 leapt out of the sun 
	         like pillars. 

	 They are all things.
	 But there is nothing there. 
	 
	 
	

	
                                                                                                                       


 Like chocolate fervour on mucus stairs 
 blue excesses of bankrupt blood creapt

 In summer naked, orange, hinged crawling 
 the barnacles of marble obscura me/you/i 
 


	
                                                                                                                       



It was to fall to him 
 The revisions, molten in the hidden.

The dream remained, sang the yew, 
	 clasped whorl horns like dew, 
	 knew the occupant's tramp flu. 

As demi-god detachable 
	 holiday algorithms do.




	
                                                                                                                       



And I have not seen the great old one 
	 Who is the poet of the dead 
	 Who is not the one who is 
	 Not the one who knows.

 By the glass dawn silence of the heart
	



	
                                                                                                                       



 I have to say
 That your smile 

 Is the sound of me
 Is the wound of me
 Is the round of me

Auto-body Corrupt


 Fog is already
   underneath the slaughter arbor, surveying
   Playboy-knocked stupendous fire-rain. Dissected, it suspects
    the gales that spurt within the bed, 
                            sing of sin. 

 Feeling the breast fraught with watery swiftness stir. 



	
                                                                                                                       



Abarbanel

 The consolation he was afraid of 
     garlanded sand

 (&) Why should it matter more than

 Tortoise fields: bosoms.

 The Beloved 
 
 
 The day I saw you was a great bird

 I could not see the sound of the tree 
 I could not see the secret of the dead 
 
 In the flowers of the architecture of night 
 I did not hear waves twisted in the sun 
 Nor hear the stars emitting silent sounds. 
 




	
                                                                                                                       



And the things of love 
 acknowledged all the pain of language, and the wise 
 of the living, and the sense that made them still 
 in that world which is an untainted great spirit

	 Loved me




	
       






 My heart is red within my hands
 A life I weave & stop, the best 
 I have not to feign, nor will I 

 Drink the frolic fat sprouting pale 
 Hive that warmed me with a sweating 
 Voice in my mother's mind, my blood

	In The Flame-Flamingo Sky-Light 

 Lamma, satyrs, bibles, pathless cobwebs, old secrets, a general star, all the world and the heavens, a beach at low tide, a song that binds the glide, flesh like the fayre, two cashiers, wood, snow, a fiery sea, a singer, an arm.



	
                                                                                                                       




 There was thus, the heart at its source. 
 The outline of a dream, an ancient strange. 
 Life, too steep for sight, or [[blank]] yes.

Diamond skies 
 Vital cold-blooded disingenuous,

	 She loved seriously 
	   Blind, there in the Third

She opened her legs to find deep

        suns half-lost 
        stung with flame 
         glutted singing


	    more conscious than ever

						she wept

	 a chafing tune puncture from the head's deep 
	     
	       typo 
	 weeny repentant tillers of cocola Aviv:
	 pawns 

	 or sad-lidded tiny-stroke truck-farmers. 
	 

	 					 The boy stares flat.

 The Argument of the Dead Man 
 
 
 I was in the middle of the river 
     and the wind was a blue blue

 And the deep night of the morning 
	 was a child being born
	 
 And a calm heart lay on the dewy grass
     somewhere unperceived bleeding







	
                                                                                                                       





  in that summer house, hours 
                   lying down, thinking

  how the blood, succumbing 
  without loss, works to heal
      imaginable and solitary tautness





	
                                                                                                                       



 May the wet moons of your quick dark heart 
    graze, counseling travellers, leaving 
  anemony happiness,
 watching it all, being warm. 
 
 


	
                                                                                                                       



        By the anxieties of wounds
             in desired structures 
              hold the sharp hairs 
 of sickness floating in the blood 
					 

					 Summer asleep 
					 Lifts flowers 
					 Curled sheers



	
                                                                                                                       



Into the crowded harvested sunlight
A swan all essential in haste and so very sensible



	
                                                                                                                       





And although Equality does seem rugged, --
	Tanned at Cannes, & acting in sextuple 
	Teeming hijink parades with passionate 
	Implacability -- self-appeasing & fearfull
	     it smells of forgotten names given to soul. 






	
                                                                                                                       





Excited by the violence of wont, I am 
  seated, betrayed in mitochondrial
                               waters. 
 
 These are dreams. Difference walls
     belonging in possibility 
       only to forgiveness. 

 



	
                                                                                                                       



Preaching: Hedon. 

Folly is no dream blush, nor
	 a decisive icon, stiff-backed 
	     among networks, flung  
	         to become the world's bait. 
	 
	             Mountain debris
	 descends with recollections. Seizes 
	 at nausea. 




	 
	
                                                                                                                       



     dew-bedabbled dams
    pained weep isobars 
	 an anxious gale of lovers



	
                                                                                                                       




	 a thin-bribed iron-hearted fire 
	    embroidering spare 
	     emblematic bushes, pauses 
	 by countryfied sunny homes

such flawed days, saturated in moisture, 
such raw space, uptilted in jostled years

         foresake illusion ill-furnished 
	             until blue  Wisdom, 
	               illicit reappears


	 							haw!






	
                                                                                                                       



                                                                                                                       






Cycle


Summer night 
    on the land.

Then sun 
   in the first breath 
      of early morning 
	
Stars lying down 
   on frosted grass

A soft fire
   in the sky
	 
A wind 
   reading 
         trees

And then night again.







	
                                                                                                                       





	To Be 
 an old man

  a thousand times, a tuft 
	  of grass that seems to be,

	          a way for the window 
	    to own the precision of the sun. 
	 
 
 
 
 
 


	
                                                                                                                       



	 The blood of the city is not a bath
      and the magic of the night occurrs
           on the other side of the road
 


	
                                                                                                                       




	 We have no time at the end for 
	      the shore where it kneels 
	 And shakes the secret shadow ropes
	    of the sea, twisted like a tree 
	 In the streams of the moon. 
	 
	 
	 


	
                                                                                                                       



   In the tomb of the world, the knowledge of 
                    man of a woman is a child 
                       that seems to be happy 
	 
	             It is these wounded who hear 
	       a wild strain of the night singing

	 
	 


	
                                                                                                                       



 
 At the end of the forest (a place
             like a bird), people 
                   call storms 
                     repose. 
 

 


	
                                                                                                                       




 The sun does not return 
 Wrinkles of the snow grow 
 
  Ghosts mountains 
      eat flowers of loves past





	
                                                                                                                       








All That I Know Of All That Is Left


	   I know your blue throat, 
		  writing as you sleep. 
			 
		 Smoke-wreaths howling 
			  over the hot sea 
			   to see my voice 
		fall so near your feet. 

		 To see the wild light
		        as rain breaks
		        into thin snow 
		            as i pause
		         on the stairs 
		     above the kitchen. 

		 These are minutes to worry 
		     about. The rain caught 
		rushing at windows, begging 
	  to hear the garden in the sun. 
	 





	
                                                                                                                       






Sharpest Vegetarian

  
 He caught the plastic bird and stood by the wall.

 Now when the bird would try to burn him with a blow, 
    to make him bleed and be vengeful, a wild mortal 
           child, hunted by the place, tickled water. 






	
                                                                                                                       



see them sleeping: 
  hair newspapered
  limbs a maze 

an early inedible light 
  leaking a timid sweetness



	
      




We Stand at 53


	 In the darkness of future weather
	  in a heaven where the self of the sun 
	  can be seen beneath summer's lightning


			 In endangered ought, 
			 where sex is asylum.





	
                                                                                                                       





Wht steals the pure mutant atom? 
A voice fucked by blood. 
 
 Summer, unthinkable, 
 Thinks of an assisted toilet
 Buffeting the meadow it tumbled from.





	
                                                                                                                       



we whip the new
	 path

	 hungry to git amour

	 a coral glow barbie 
	 jerking a long plague
	           of passive attention 
	 



	
                                                                                                                       




Are you Ready To Eat Chain? 

 Grimaces. Half-trained voices: dark ground. 

 Even erosions pausing. Calfing.
 Adorations full of prehensions.

 Moralists embracing in remote hospices:
  switchboards peddling inexplicably inauspicious 
  limits honed from unreasonable ambitions, 
  newly-hatched schemes struck down as they are overtaken.





	
                                                                                                                       



The House of Life: 
 
 
 To be a thing of the world 
       a thing in the world
                     a song. 
 



	
                                                                                                                       




         where rivers enter the sun,
   afflictions of this world become 
     dissolute questions, rooted in 
                       blind bodies.





	
                                                                                                                       



Add a pact 
	 to the end of the rising 
	 and welcome the incomprehensible seed. 
	 



	
                                                                                                                      




Leave me here to watch over the storm

    Save the story of that hour 
	 its likeness to a vein 
  opening the afternoon I was born





	
                                                                                                                       



Life is no longer 
	 the greatest word 
	 in the presence 
	 of trees 

	 a raft

 Friendship 


      I choose years where less 
    Is sown. Let innocence roam
    To love a cruel clever foam.

 All words are orphans! I guess
  The times you hurt descend to 
       Make you hold me in blue. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


	
                                                                                                                       




Thrive, holy. Keep
  the sound of heaven 
  rhetorical; your bark 
	 a delirium rebuffed 
	         by the sky. 
	 

	 


	
                                                                                                                       




And I think them singing,

Swollen amused and undressed
 sirens chuckle over coffee.




	
                                                                                                                       




	Loss -- Wonderful -- 

 Sometimes the cathedral 
 			eats revenge:
 			hundred-fold
 			base-vacancy
 			spit    from 
 			yearning-seed. 
            
             A bent  
               wistful parable. 

 


	
                                                                                                                       






What Is It For 
 

	 A world that is not world
	 The dead who are not dead
	 A dream that is not dream







	
                                                                                                                       

	 

	Who is the one who makes me 
	 
	
 A kind of identity, a kind of a 
	    saint, a child in a tree, 
		a red bird under the sea.

	 There are dead 
	 in the mountains 
	 in caskets of oak 
	 in the sway of decay

Something made this world 
to hear the lost
voices of the dead 


	 Each summer of the earth 
	 The sun harvests latent lives 
	 Voices leak out of a void all alone

	 
	 
	 



	
         






	Poem Of The Sacred

 
 when I was nine 
 and happy to see faces
 seeking a sweet and wild sun
 
 I could see the sounds of women 
 and in the word of my mother's body 
 sense flowers in the breast of my mind







	
                                                                                                                       




The Thick Blue 

 
 Air offered during the world's destruction
	 Is only a little slow wind 
	 Smiling in an archive of hair
	 




	
                                                                                                                       




 Until the world stood under that bright cell 
 On the high roof of the river
 The women moved and tossed
 And all creatures fell



	
                                                                                                                       




	 Born to a selfish death
  a meadow-sweet all-night keyboard 

	 I breathe a giant diamond



	
                                                                                                                       




  You must keep an emergency over my tightness 

	    in your body I cease
	       avoiding my life




	
                                                                                                                       



Neuropathology of crepuscular devotion. 
   Autumn preserving impossible curves.
   Dahlias cuddled together with vines.
	


	
                                                                                                                       



	 
	 And I am 
	 And I am not the one

	 I am not 
	 The only one who is 
	 
	 I am not the only one 
	 I am not 
	 

	 


	
                                                                                                                       



   Inviolate: All 

		 
		 leafless rain
		   whispers
		    a poem 



	
                                                                                                                       



The flower of clichés

	   blot  powdered   kindling  
	   in the glowing   cat

Lips a silent fire in   the dark




	
                                                                                                                       


	 In the End 
	 
	 
	 I saw a mountain 
	  membrane 
	 Of  darkness 
	 Spring  from a shadow

	 


	
                                                                                                                       



   volcano  anchored  anarchy 
	 
	 


	
                                                                                                                       



Timid laundromats
eat tyrants, each 

Extra-Inning wall
contour  stripped



	
                                                                                                                       





but now a primitive part, just one 
	 
        an intense irregular enigma 
	  of my childhood      in denim

	 leopards on tv, a battery box 
	        -- this grift world

	      earthy in its weight 
	     made    sentimental

	    endurance  a voice
	     like a sea flapping

	       contagious as dust





	
                                                                                                                       




 Fat! Fat! Fat! Fat! Fat! 
 I walk on the highway, look at me.

The Importance of South


One needs a thirty-seventh day: 
A peaceful, neglected, raving huge prophet mall. 
Fish-net thistles, abandoned pinstripes, demon worship.

Rockets waiting in a cup. Precocious
Rocks doused in impossiblities. 
Roots in the sun on the hill. 
	 






	
    


	Be The Same. 



	
                                                                                                                       


 
	 
	 I am Woman, I am the Woman, 
	 The world's my love. And the soul of the sea 
	 Tossed from the deep lake of the sun.

	 The river is full of ice. 

	 All is shadow,

 Lush flukes of waste 
  in funereal concussions

    where a single star
                    waits
 


	
                                                                                                                       



The building came in streams,— 
   strands crossing the front door. 
A nakedness at the end of the hall.


	
                                                                                                                       






Turtles prepare. Travelling over dark
Green land to see a warm voice touch a wall.

Driven to a cry of wild radiance.


	
                                                                                                                     

A replica of time curved at the end 
Fears the sight of an artificial is. 


	
                                                                                                                       

Speech winks and conceals its poor hands, re-  
Senting an audience it did not Will.


	
                                                                                                                       

Gypsies meekly urge the mangroves to taste 
Creativity's gratified beauty.

 The wood was torn with purple silver. 
 Romantic larkspur struck the past.

 Outside hours informed depression:

book, even a fragmentary one, has a center which attracts it. This center if not fixed, but is
displaced by the pressure of the book and circumstances of its composition. Yet it is also a fixed
center which, if it is genuine, displaces itself, while remaining the same and becoming always
more central, more hidden, more uncertain and more imperious. He who writes the book writes
it out of desire for this center and out of ignorance. The feeling of having touched it can very
well be only the illusion of having reached it. When the book in question is one whose purpose is
to elucidate, there is a kind of methodological good faith in stating toward what point it seems to
be directed: here, toward the pages entitled "Orpheus' Gaze."

Introduction
Why is it that, notwithstanding all the other means of investigating and ordering the world which
mankind has developed, and in spite of all the reservations great poets have expressed about their
own endeavor, we are still interested in literature? What is literature, and what is implied about
our learning in general and about its history, if it must be said at this late date that something we
call literature has never stopped fascinating us? Maurice Blanchot asks this question with such
infinite patience -- with so much care and precision -- that it has come to preoccupy a whole
generation of French critics and social commentators. Hence Blanchot's imposing reputation.
The list of postwar writers in France who have responded to his emphasis on the question of
literature and its implications for all our questions is long and impressive. Their names are
associated with the most provocative intellectual developments of recent times: not only have
Jean-Paul Sartre, Georges Poulet, and Jean Starobinski written about Blanchot, not only
Emmanuel Levinas, Georges Bataille, Michel Leiris, and Pierre Klossowski, but also Michel 
Foucault, Jacques Derrida, Jean-Luc Nancy, and Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe. 1 One way of
indicating Blanchot's enormous importance in French thought during the last half century is by
reference to Jeffrey Mehlman's commentary in the pages of ModernLanguage Notes

1A lengthy bibliography of Blanchot's works and of studies about him by others may be
consulted in Sub-stance, no. 14 ( 1976), an issue entirely devoted to his writing. Here, I
simply draw the reader's attention to essays by Georges Poulet, Jean Starobinski, Emmanuel
Levinas , Michel Foucault, and Roger Laporte, among others, which appeared in Critique, no.
229 ( June 1966). Jean-Paul Sartre commentary, "Aminadab; ou, du fantastique considéré
comme un langage," appears in Situations I ( Paris: Gallimard, 1947). Roger Laporte and
Bernard Noël Deux lectures de Maurice Blanchot ( Montpellier: Fata Morgana, 1973), should
also be mentioned. Emmanuel Levinas book, Sur Maurice Blanchot

Language Notes. 2 When Mehlman, certainly one of the most informed and lively interpreters of
modern French letters to an American readership, undertakes to bring this very modernity
radically into doubt, he begins with a reading of Blanchot's earliest publications: as though
Blanchot's work were a key -- the point to tackle. The present translation of L'Espace littéraire, a
book from the middle of Blanchot's career which elaborates many of the issues central to his
entire work, should serve to help Americans understand what is at stake in an ongoing
assessment of contemporary French thought.
It would be wrong, however, to imply that Blanchot's writing has escaped until now the attention
of serious readers in this country. In fact, his work has influenced a good deal of recent
American criticism whose object is to question the critical enterprise itself and its relation to the
nature of writing. Blanchot provides a model of literary study because, as Geoffrey Hartman
says, his criticism always goes from the work under discussion to the problematic nature of
literature. "He illumines, therefore, the literary activity in general as well as in this or that

( Montpellier: Fata Morgana, 1975), is of particular interest; Pierre Klossowski wrote an essay
of that same title which is printed in Un Si Funeste Désir ( Paris: Gallimard, 1963). For
Jacques Derrida's reading of Blanchot, the reader may wish to see "Living On," in
Deconstruction and Criticism ( New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1979). Finally, I
note a volume to which Jean-Luc Nancy and Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, among others,
contributed, Misère de la littérature ( Paris: Christian Bourgois, 1978). Here, the essays
cannot be said to be on Blanchot. A short piece written by him, "Il n'est d'explosion . . . ,"
opens the book, and by implication, the "literary space" to which the authors of the following
texts feel they belong.
2
Jeffrey Mehlman, "Blanchot at Combat: Of Literature and Terror," Modern Language Notes,
French Issue, 95 ( 1980): 808-29. Mehlman's essay draws attention to Blanchot's political
writings during the 1930s. Indeed, between 1930 and 1940, Blanchot was an active
contributor to right-wing journals in France (see Jean-Louis Loubet del Bayle, Les
Nonconformistes des années 30, Paris: le Seuil, 1969). The war ended this particular -- and, in
light of his subsequent reputation, surprising -- engagement, but not his attention to political
issues. Blanchot's literary reflections after the war led him to take, notably in 1958 and in
1968, a different sort of position entirely: a leftist one. He was, for example, one of the 
initiators of the manifesto called Le Manifeste des 121, supporting the right of Frenchmen to
refuse to serve in the army during the Algerian War (see the volume intitled Le Droit à
l'insoumission [ Paris: Maspéro, 1961], which assembles, around the manifesto itself,
numerous texts attesting to the political debate it elicited). The relation between Blanchot's
initial political views and his later ones, and the connection between these views and his
critical and literary work, are very important and complicated problems which Mehlman
begins to elucidate. No doubt they have significant implications for contemporary French
thought in general. They require, in my view, a great deal of further consideration. I cite
Mehlman's text, not as the definitive word in this matter, but primarily in order to suggest
how much is generally recognized to hang upon Blanchot's writing: the very character of
critical reflection in France today.

text." 3
Paul de Man included in Blindness and Insight an important chapter on Blanchot's
reading of Mallarmé in which he examines central sections of L'Espace littéraire.
4
Edward Said,
to give another example, refers in Beginnings to Blanchot's reflections on the "origin" of
literature, and he too cites L'Espace littéraire.
5
In order to suggest the unusual character of Blanchot's appeal and the unsettling force of his
writing, we ought to include here another statement of Hartman's: "Blanchot's work offers no
point of approach whatsoever"; or even this remark of Poulet's, which I translate somewhat
freely: "Blanchot is an even greater waste of time than Proust." 6
For, surely, the significance of a
book like L'Espace littéraire lies in its constant association of literature's purest and most
authentic grandeur with just such expressions as "wasted time." It presents the literary work as
that which permits no approach other than wasted steps; it uninterruptedly expresses the
incomparable passion which literature commands.
Its purpose, even its mission -- for this is a term Blanchot somewhat startlingly employs -- is to
interrupt the purposeful steps we are always taking toward deeper understanding and a surer
grasp upon things. It wants to make us hear, and become unable to ignore, the stifled call of a
language spoken by no one, which affords no grasp upon anything. For this distress, this utter
insecurity, is, Blanchot states, "the source of all authenticity."
In dreams, Blanchot says, one sometimes thinks one knows one is dreaming, but only dreams
this. In the same way, the reader of L'Espace littéraire imagines that, alongside Blanchot, he is in
search of certain answers. He is aware, he thinks, of the difficulties, the dangerous confusions,
and therefore he is not at their mercy, but more than likely to see the light eventually or, in other
words, to awaken. He has et, however, to begin the dream; he has yet to see that he is in the dark.

By the end, the reader is able to make out some important questions: What moves a writer to
write? What is the origin of his undertaking, and how does this origin determine the nature of his
creativity? What is the role of the reader? How is the work's meaning communicated? How do
reading and writing relate to other human endeavors? How are literary, philosophical, social and
political history intertwined? Certainly, one does pursue these difficult questions in the pages of
L'Espace littéraire. One pursues them, moreover, through what are without doubt some of the
most perceptive and engaging discussions in existence on Mallarmé, on Kafka, on Rilke, and on
Hölderlin. This gratifying process, however, leads to where one thought it began: to the
difficulties, the questions, as though they -- the very obstacles along the way, marking and
measuring the approach ( "l'approche de l'espace littéraire") -- had been the answers already,
wonderfully transparent, though now they arise opaque and strange, and as though one were just
now, when long departed deep within L'Espace littéraire, ready to begin approaching it.
Such paradoxes are characteristic of Blanchot's work. They present to the reader difficulties of an
unusual sort: difficulties which it is difficult to confront, to encounter, problems it is hard to
know one is having. Hence the uncanny ease which one also experiences. I first discovered
Blanchot's critical work in a university course on fantastic literature. Ever since, it has seemed to
me that complaints about his abstruse qualities express readers' premonition of the eeriest
limpidity, their foreboding sense of the incredible lightness of the task before them. The muscles
they have limbered up in readiness will not be necessary. To be sure, Blanchot's books take for
granted a considerable erudition on the reader's part; he ranges familiarly over world literature
and philosophy. But they are not aimed at experts or connoisseurs, just at readers. And reading is
the simplest thing, he says. It requires no talent, no gifts, no special knowledge, no singular
strength at all. But weakness, uncertainty -- yes, in abundance.
It calls upon uncertainty, I was suggesting, about uncertainty itself: uncertainty about limits such
as those that distinguish the dark and the light, the obscurities of the work itself and its
elucidation, the inside and the outside of the text -- literature and criticism. Still,

'temps perdu'" ('Thus, much more radically even than Proust, Maurice Blanchot appears as a
man of 'lost time'" ( "Maurice Blanchot, critique et romancier," Critique, no. 229 [ June
1966]).

L'Espace littéraire retains plenty of the outward signs of straightforward discussion. Among its
paradoxes, moreover, there are, not infrequently, aphorisms, pleasing in their definitive tone:
"Art is primarily the consciousness of unhappiness, not its consolation," for example. Or: "The
central point of the work of art is the work as origin, the point which cannot be reached, yet the
only one which is worth reaching." In fact, L'Espace littéraire is practically the last book in
which Blanchot allowed himself such resoundingly definite postulates. It was published by
Gallimard in 1955 after a number of fictions (for example, Thomas l'obscur, L'Arrêt de mort, Le
Très-Haut) and several critical works (notably Faux Pas, Lautréamont et Sade, La Part du feu). 7
Thereafter, the relation between critical discussion and its object becomes ever more problematic
and the distinction between Blanchot's own critical texts and his fictional narratives less
pertinent. From L'Attente l'oubli ( Paris: Gallimard, 1962) to La Folie du jour ( Montpellier: Fata
Morgana, 1973) and L'Ecriture du désastre ( Paris: Gallimard, 1980), it is increasingly doubtful
not only whether literature is something about which one can adequately speak but also whether
there is any such thing as the literature about which we do, in any case, speak. In other words, it
is ever harder to be sure that questions such as "What is literature?" or even "Is literature?" are
not themselves already, or merely, literature. Is it into literature at last, or finally out of its
shadowy domain, that Le Pas au-delà ( Paris: Gallimard, 1973) would step? It is not possible to
say; it is possible only to retrace the step which, repetitively marking their separation, renders
within and without indistinguishable. The reader of L'Espace littéraire will be in a good position
to understand why this is the case, even if he must remain inconsolable.
In L'Espace littéraire, as in Blanchot's work generally, there is a continually implicit, and often
explicit, reference to German philosophy: especially to Hegel, to Heidegger -- whose meditation,
through the works of Hölderlin, upon the essence of poetry is particularly significant

7All the works cited here, with the exception of Lautréamont et Sade ( Paris: Editions de
Minuit, 1949), were published in Paris by Gallimard: Thomas l'Obscur in 1941, L'Arrêt de
mort and Le Très-Haut in 1948, Faux Pas in 1943, La Part du feu in 1949.
Both Thomas l'Obscur and L'Arrêt de mort have been translated into English. Robert
Lamberton is the translator of Thomas l'Obscur ( Thomas the Obscure [ New York: D. Lewis,
1973]) -- or, more precisely, of the "new version" of this narrative published by Blanchot in
1950, nine years after the first edition. Lydia Davis translated L'Arrêt de mort ( Death
Sentence [ Tarrytown, N.Y.: Station Hill Press, 1978]). These are, so far, the only books by
Blanchot, besides the present volume, available in their entirety in English.

or Blanchot -- and to Nietzsche. Blanchot's reading of Hegel bears the distinct mark of Bataille's;
likewise, he shares his approach to Heidegger with Levinas to a certain extent. And when he
quotes Nietzsche's hearty praise of suicide, we should also hear an echo of Kirilov's vacillating
distress.
With Hegel, Blanchot recognizes negativity as the moving force of the dialectic. It is the power
that informs history; it is death, creative and masterful, at work in the world. Indeed, Blanchot
hails the impending completion of this labor which is the realization of human possibilities, the
unfolding of truth. And he acknowledges that this progress -- whereby meanings are determined,
values assigned, mysteries solved; whereby man liberates himself from the unknown and
imposes his autonomous will in the clear light of day -- leaves art, the preserve of ambiguities
and indecision, behind, just as it suppresses and surpasses the gods, the mysteries of the sacred.
The work attains its ultimate and essential form, not in the work of art, but in that work which is
the gradual achievement of human mastery and freedom: history -- history as a whole, the total
realization of that liberating process. And yet, Blanchot's attention is dedicated to that in the
work which does not fit into this whole, this culmination. He has given himself up to something
belonging only to art, which will not settle for the status assigned to art by history's sovereign
movement (monument to man's creativity, repository of cultural values, or object offered up to 
pure esthetic enjoyment). In art Blanchot hears, murmuring with mute insistence, the very source
of creativity. And this source is inexhaustible. Truth and its satisfactions cannot finish off the
power of negativity.
This is the point at which we can grasp the importance of Bataille in Blanchot's thought. Indeed,
much of L'Espace littéraire reads like a conversation between Blanchot and Bataille, a
conversation that continues in L'Entretien infini ( Paris: Gallimard, 1969), and L'Amitié ( Paris:
Gallimard, 1971). We hear it in works of Bataille as well (in L'Expéience intérieure, for
example). 8
It is a conversation sustained by a common awareness of negativity as excess,
foreign to purpose. Death is an infinitely futile more, which will not serve to achieve anything.
Compared to this fruitless expenditure, the mastery which the use of death affords is perhaps a
poor thing; in any case, it cannot use death up. Death subsists, and subsisting, proves itself to be
a source of power

8Georges Bataille, L'Expérience intérieure, in Oeuvres complétes ( Paris: Gallimard, 1973),
vol. 5.

that power is powerless to exhaust -- a nothing that exceeds everything. Never providing
anything like satisfaction, it is unspeakably desirable. Both Blanchot and Bataille tell of desire,
or the experience of the infinite remainder: power, reaching as high as it can, longs to reach its
own possibility -- death, its very source and essence -- by undergoing the measurelessness of
impotence. Both writers name the contradiction in such an alliance, or the intimacy of such strife,
"communication." It risks, with the unjustifiable audacity Blanchot terms inspiration, all of
language, everything that might ever be communicated, and the whole world that words put at
our disposal.
Thus when Blanchot borrows Hegel's perspective and addresses us as if from the end of history
when all that can be has been accomplished, he does so, not to announce the truth as it discloses
itself in its realized wholeness to the mind whose comprehension is likewise complete, but rather
in order to make us hear what Heidegger urges: let the sole being -- man -- whose being stems
from his capacity not to be, affirm that "not," the most proper of all his possibilities and the one
proper to him alone, the possibility of impossibility (see Being and Time, sec. 50). This is the
possibility which everything that is possible hides; it has had, indeed, to be suppressed in order
that anything be possible, in order that there be a world and the history of this world. But it must
be resolutely acknowledged, if ever there is to be authenticity.
This demand is the one Blanchot associates with the work of art. The work requires death, the
source, to be in the work; it demands that in it the ending, which initiates all beginnings, swell up
as the essence of all swelling, all unfurling and flowering. It wants disappearance to come forth.
It asks in other words that Being, which by receding opens the space in which beings appear,
come into this clearing. The work asks that a retreat, an obscuring or effacement, show, or that
the forgetfulness which inaugurates thought return to it.
Whenever Blanchot speaks about this care, this concern in the work for the origin of the work,
we recognize his proximity to Heidegger. And all of L'Espace littéraire is imbued with care: le
souci de l'origine, le souci de l'oeuvre, anxious solicitude for a time before the time when beings 
supplant being and submit to the command of the objectifying, acquisitive subject; concern for a
time other than the time measured by the gradual reduction of the irreconcilably alien to the
homogeneity of all that is comprehensively mastered. To the extent that in the work of art the
impossible is realized as such, art alone answers, with true fidelity, to the requirement of
Heideggerian authenticity. Yet there is also in L'Espace littéraire, as in

all of Blanchot -- and this accounts for Blanchot's kinship with Levinas -- concern for being's
effacement itself: concern, precisely, lest it show, lest being be robbed of that indefiniteness, that
seclusion, that foreignness from which it is inseparable. Together Blanchot and Levinas reverse
the terms in which Being and Time poses the question of authenticity. Their concern is not to fail
death through very resoluteness, forgetting that only forgetfulness keeps faith with it and that
estrangement is its unique intimacy. The unconcern, however, which Blanchot locates at the very
center of his concern, as well as his insistence upon the irreducibly impersonal character of the
origin and his paradoxical way of making breach or tear synonymous with intimacy, turn this
book more decisively in Bataille's direction than in Levinas's.
The estrangement from death, moreover, which Blanchot considers to be required of the writer
by literature, even as literature requires of him that he greet and affirm death, determines that the
writer never, properly speaking, be favored with any requirement at all. He has no vocation; he is
one deprived of the very call that haunts him. That is why the quotations from Nietzsche in
L'Espace littéraire, which almost all express the admirably bold refusal to cringe and hide from
death, are presented with irony. The suicide manqué, indeed, even the baseness apparent in his
inability to face death honestly -- headon -- expresses more truly, perhaps, than anything else the
essence of death, which is always to elude an authentic confrontation. It never presents itself for
a duel, but represents itself; it comes disguising its coming. In fact, its essence is not to come at
all -- ever -- but ever to come again. In later works by Blanchot, the Nietzsche of the Eternal
Return is a constant reference. He is never cited in L'Espace littéraire, but he is never far.
For when disappearance appears, it is its apparition. Likewise, when the end begins, when it
swells and blossoms as the truth of all beginnings (and that it should, we recall, is the demand
Blanchot hears the work making), it is not the end itself that starts, and it is no real start that
occurs. Rather, the impossibility of there ever being a first time starts over again, in the guise of
an interminable ending. Then the work -- at the very instant of its apotheosis, its devastating
announcement that it is, and nothing more -- subsides, engulfed in duplicity; it enters "the eternal
torment of dying"; it draws the writer with it into this error which sustains no resolute being-fordeath.
It disguises what

reveals it and only lets itself be discovered by what perverts it. Is that why it always seems to
have the innocence of something never exposed, perfectly intact? Is it like a flower just on the
sheer verge of blooming because clouds of inauthenticity enfold and conserve it? No one knows,
as Blanchot regularly repeats.
His writing recedes toward such questions. They are the sole answers he presumes to propose.
"The authentic answer is always the question's vitality," he writes. "It can close in around the 
question, but it does so in order to preserve the question by keeping it open." Perhaps this is a
good way of suggesting once again the character of Blanchot's work which renders it somewhat
alien to us in this country, but also fascinating, like a mirror. The Anglo-American critical
tradition might be said to elucidate, and thus to honor, the actual object which writers offer us.
We take the work to be what artists make in the course of a labor, a struggle perhaps, to which
they alone are equal; or perhaps they bring it back to us from depths to which they alone
descend. Attentive to masterful technique and perfected form, we seek to comprehend the
profound achievement of the blackest text by Kafka, say. We try to do justice to its strong and
genuine character, even if we acknowledge shifty ambiguity to be the necessary vehicle of this
authenticity, or recognize playfulness as the special grace of this rigorous perfection, or
understand that misery is what this treasure holds, weakness what this awesome manifestation of
strength has to express. But the Kafka that concerns Blanchot is the nameless young man who
cannot seem to write at all. He is reduced to lamentable games. The author of The
Metamorphosis had to suppress and surpass him. The profundity of The Metamorphosis is, for
Blanchot, the infinite depths of uncertainty and futility which its perfection masks -- which the
work shows only by masking -- but which we seem actually to see laid bare sometimes when the
masterpiece, like Eurydice when Orpheus looks back, disappears.
To see something disappear: again, this is an experience which cannot actually start. Nor,
therefore, can it ever come to an end. Such, Blanchot insists, is the literary experience: an ordeal
in which what we are able to do (for example, see), becomes our powerlessness; becomes, for
instance, that terribly strange form of blindness which is the phantom, or the image, of the clear
gaze -- an incapacity to stop seeing what is not there to be seen.

I do not wish to overemphasize the problems of translation which I have encountered. By
comparison to many French critical texts currently being translated, this one appears quite
simple: word play, for example, is not striking in it, not immediately so in any event, and it does
not depend upon any unusual terminology. However, I would like to discuss here three
expressions in particular because they are something like the key words of the book; they also
permit me to restate in more concrete terms some of the issues I have evoked above.
The first of these expressions appears in the title: L'Espace littéraire. The word espace recurs
regularly in the titles of chapters: "Approche de l'espace littéraire," "L'Espace et l'exigence de
l'oeuvre," "L'Oeuvre et l'espace de la mort." It means "space," the region toward which whoever
reads or writes is drawn -- literature's "domain." But, although words such as "region" or
"domain" or "realm" are often used to designate this zone, it implies the withdrawal of what is
ordinarily meant by "place"; it suggests the site of this withdrawal. Literature's space is like the
place where someone dies: a nowhere, Blanchot says, which is here. No one enters it, though no
one who is at all aware of it can leave: it is all departure, moving off, éloignement. It is
frequently called le dehors, "the outside." Here we might think again of the dreamer we evoked
earlier in this discussion who, dreaming that he only dreams, falls back into the dream to the very
degree that he has the impression of freedom from it: it could just as well be said that he never
enters the dream at all; he only ever dreams he does. Literature's "space" is likewise inaccessible
and inescapable; it is its very own displacement or removal. It is the space separating this space
from itself. In this strange ambiguity literature dwells, as in a preserve. 
Yet "in" must always be taken back, for literature's space shelters nothing within it: it is also
called le vide, "the void." Sometimes it is associated with the anonymity of big cities, sometimes
with the gap left by the absence of the gods, but sometimes, too, with what Rilke calls "the
Open," or the "world's inner space," the intimacy of an expansive welcome, the inward yes
which death can say in the song of one who consents to fall silent and disappear. Or it is
connected with the interval, which for Hölderlin is the sacred, between gods that abandon the
world and men who, likewise, turn away from God -- the sheer void in between, which the poet
must keep pure. Almost always, it is the origin which is anterior to any beginning, the image or
echo of beginning -- that immense fund of impotence, the infinitely futile wherewithal to start
over and over again. Literature's space, in other words -- the

void which literature introduces in place of the place it takes -- is analogous to the "other time" in
the time measured by achievements: sterile, inert time, "the time of distress." But the very
freshness of every dawn is safeguarded in this distress and nowhere else, which is why literature
demands that we return there (though this justification is never granted), risking the clear light of
day in the name of sunshine, but more than just that: jeopardizing even this capacity of ours to
take risks in the name of something, for some purpose.
With considerable regularity, literature's "space" is described as exile or banishment, and the
writer as one wandering in the desert, like Kafka far from Canaan, too weak to collaborate in the
active concerns of competent men; but then, too, the desert is a privileged zone of freedom and
solitude, and if literature is exiled from the world of valuable achievements, it is also exempted
from the world's demands. It has to bear no responsibility for anything; it is kept safe to itself:
the desert is its refuge. Or it would be, if to be so gratuitous were not a grave danger for
literature, and also if the desert were a here one could actually reach. Kafka is never quite
convinced that he isn't still in Canaan after all.
Thus, l'espace littéraire, or l'espace de l'oeuvre, is the "distance" of the work, or of literature,
with respect, not only to "every other object which exists," but with respect to itself. The work is
remote from itself, or not quite itself. For example, when it isn't finished yet. But when it is done,
when it comes into its own, this distance persists: it constitutes the opening of the work onto
nothing but itself -- this opening, this vacancy. And since the work appears, then, as pure
deferral, a void or vacuum, it lends itself to being filled up with everything it isn't: with useful
meanings, for example, which multiply and change as history progresses. Or this void can
masquerade as the prestigious aura that surrounds the timeless masterpiece in its museum case.
Yet these apparent travesties, these various ways in which the work is misrepresented and
forgotten, sustain it; they protect its essence, which is to disappear. They provide it with its
"space," which is not its location. But this is not to say that literature is to be found anywhere
else.
I had thought of proposing as a title for this book "Literature's Remove." I hoped thereby to
capture not only literature's distance from the world, and not only this distance as literature's
preserve, but also that when "space" is literature's, it is space opened by that opening's absence:
by the removal of that very interval, which is kept, as if for some other time, in reserve.

"Remove" could suggest a reflective distance, and it might be thought that literature involves a
separation from the world permitting contemplation or critical interpretation of things and
events. This sense of the term "remove" is in fact operative in L'Espace littéraire. Or rather, its
mirror image is. For literature's "space," Blanchot emphasizes, is the resurgence of the distance
at which we must place anything we wish to understand or aim to grasp. Literature is this remove
coming back to us, returning like an echo; and now it is no longer a handy gap, a familiar and
useful nothing, but an unidentifiable something, the strange immediacy, foreign to presence and
to any present, of remoteness itself. It grasps us, and it removes us from our power to grasp or
appropriate anything whatever -- especially literature.
I have, in fact, used "remove" in the body of the text as one translation of l'écart, of
l'éloignement, sometimes of la distance, occasionally of la réserve. But l'espace, which should
surely be understood as related to these terms indicating separation (and linked thus to the
French word espacement), is always translated somewhat lamely as "space," primarily in the
interests of consistency. For the word espace is the main constant in this book, and if, in order
not to sacrifice the significance of its repetition, I had translated it, each time it appears, as
"remove," there would have been certain inaccuracies. "The Space of Literature," then, seeks to
preserve a semblance of what seems to have been on Blanchot's part a move to unify the book (to
give it the strangest unity): to associate in the title -- L'Espace littéraire -- "l'espace de l'oeuvre"
and "l'espace de la mort," the work's space and death's.
The French text practically always distinguishes between the word oeuvre and the word travail:
between the "work of art" and "work" in the sense of productive labor -- man's action upon
nature, his mastery and appropriation of the given. Thus, le souci de l'oeuvre, "concern for the
work of art" (which is also the work's own troubled concern), is regularly contrasted with le
souci réalisateur, "the concern for real achievements," which implies effective action. This real
purposefulness is the process by which history unfolds, by which darkness is made to recede
before the broad light of day. Man becomes free; he discovers his potentialities and fulfills them.
All this takes place in what Blanchot regularly terms "the world," or on the level he calls "the
worldly plane." The world is this historical process; it is its own gradual realization. But the artist
is ineffectual. He has no place in the world. It is not that he belongs to what we ordinarily think
of as the other world. If he is

allied to the sacred, this is because he belongs neither to this world nor to any other, but to the
"other of all worlds" in our own.
He is idle, inert, "désoeuvré." He is "out of work" to the very extent that his sole concern is for
the work. For l'oeuvre is impotence endlessly affirmed. Le travail, on the other hand, is
negativity in action, death as power and possibility.
L'oeuvre, then, immediately implies its revocation: perhaps one could say that in
Blanchotl'oeuvre and le désoeuvrement are translations of each other. The difference, in other
words, between l'oeuvre and le travail is that while le travail is diametrically opposed to inaction
and passivity, l'oeuvre requires them. Indeed, Blanchot frequently describes l'oeuvre, not as the
union of contraries, but as their restless alliance, their torn intimacy. He treats the word oeuvre 
the way he treats the word inspiration: the title of the section of this book devoted to inspiration
is "Inspiration, Lack of Inspiration."
I have consistently used the English word "work" to refer to l'oeuvre, the work of art. For travail
I have used various expressions such as "productive or purposeful activity," "labor," "effort,"
"real endeavor," "effective or useful action." I have most often translated désoeuvrement as
"inertia," thereby emphasizing the paradox whereby the artist's relation to the work, the demand
which he feels is made of him that there be a work, overwhelms him, not with creative powers,
but on the contrary, with their exhaustion. The approach of the work does not elicit in him the
strength to reach and achieve it, but immobilizes him. It calls upon his weakness, the incapacity
in him to achieve anything at all; it inspires in him a kind of numbness or stupefaction. When
Blanchot says of the writer that he is désoeuvré, I have written that the writer is idled or out of
work, thereby emphasizing how the work to be realized requires nothing of him, gives him
nothing to do -- perversely demands that he do: nothing -- but also stressing how the work
excludes him, sets him outside it. He never knows the work except as the terrible immediacy of
this dismissal. It must also be understood that the work thus presents itself to him as its absence.
Le désoeuvrement is the absence of the work, "l'absence de l'oeuvre." I come closest to
expressing this when I translate désoeuvrement as "lack of work."
Occasionally, Blanchot does use the word oeuvre to refer to something other than the work of
art: notably, to history as a whole -- completed history as mankind's oeuvre, the total realization
of

human freedom and the ultimate goal of humanity. The phrase l'oeuvre humaine en général
recurs several times in section VII where, precisely, Blanchot is stressing a tendency on the part
of the artist, who acknowledges only l'oeuvre as his task, to confuse this work with the work of
history. Or, if he doesn't make this mistake -- and to the very extent that he doesn't -- his
tendency to renounce his own task in favor of the other. I have translated l'oeuvre humaine en
général as "the human undertaking as a whole," or "the overall work of humanity."
Finally, in three or four spots, the expressions "to be at work" (à l'oeuvre) and "to go back to
work" (se remettre à l'oeuvre) appear in Blanchot's text. The writer, for example, inasmuch as he
is "out of work," can only ever return to the work (se remettre à l'oeuvre): reapply himself to it
tirelessly and uselessly, go back to what he cannot get to -- go back to work. Or the interminably
affirmative No, which keeps on revoking all achievements, is "at work" (à l'oeuvre) in the work -
- causing its presence endlessly to revert to absence, causing this regression infernally to emerge,
causing the inexhaustibly persistent presence of absence. These examples account, I believe, for
all departures from the general rule: "work" always means the "work of art," as opposed to le
travail, just as lucidity in the deep of night means the phantom lucidity of the insomniac poet, as
opposed both to the good sense of broad daylight and to the peaceful sleep, the honest oblivion,
which reason requires at regular intervals.
My translation of the recurring word exigence is awkward. This word appears, for example, in
one of the section titles quoted earlier: "L'Espace et l'exigence de l'oeuvre"; another section is
entitled "Rilke et l'exigence de la mort." What is the demand of death? What does the work
want? L'exigence de l'oeuvre means not simply what is required of the artist in order to make a 
work of art -- the skill and patience that give form and coherence -- though the work does
demand these. Neither is l'exigence de l'oeuvre simply the demand that there be a work, although
the implications of this demand are certainly part of Blanchot's concern. L'exigence de l'oeuvre
does mean the peculiarly harsh demand that the work makes of the "creator," which is different
from the demands of any other task: that all his powers be plunged in weakness, that he come
into an immense wealth of silence and inertia. But still more, the work's demand is this: that
Orpheus look back. That suddenly, desire should wreck everything -- the desire to look at the
dark when this naked mask is showing, and not when, veiled by clarity, clothed in the light, it can
be seen.

No one begins to write, Blanchot says, who is not already somehow on the verge of this ruinous
look back, and yet the sole approach to that turning point is writing. The form of the work's
demand is circular. It is like the demand Blanchot imagines being made of Abraham: that, having
no son, he kill his son. And thus it is like l'exigence de la mort. What is one to do to die? More
than everything is required, less than nothing is called for.

The Space of Literature



The Essential Solitude I



It seems that we learn something about art when we experience what the word solitude is meant
to designate. This word has been much abused. Still, what does the expression to be alone
signify? When is one alone? Asking this question should not simply lead us into melancholy
reflections. Solitude as the world understands it is a hurt which requires no further comment
here.
We do not intend to evoke the artist's solitude either -- that which is said to be necessary to him
for the practice of his art. When Rilke writes to the countess of Solms-Laubach ( August 3, 
1907), "For weeks, except for two short interruptions, I haven't pronounced a single word; my
solitude has finally encircled me and I am inside my efforts just as the core is in the fruit," the
solitude of which he speaks is not the essential solitude. It is concentration.
The Solitude of the Work
In the solitude of the work -- the work of art, the literary work -- we discover a more essential
solitude. It excludes the complacent isolation of individualism; it has nothing to do with the quest
for singularity. The fact that one sustains a stalwart attitude throughout the disciplined course of
the day does not dissipate it. He who writes the work is set aside; he who has written it is
dismissed. He who is dismissed, moreover, doesn't know it. This ignorance preserves him. It
distracts him by authorizing him to persevere. The writer never knows whether the work is done.
What he has finished in one book, he starts over or destroys in another. Valéry, celebrating this
infinite quality which the work enjoys, still sees only its least problematic aspect. That the work
is infinite means, for him, that the artist, though unable to finish it, can nevertheless make it the
delimited site of an endless task whose incompleteness

develops the mastery of the mind, expresses this mastery, expresses it by developing it in the
form of power. At a certain moment, circumstances -- that is, history, in the person of the
publisher or in the guise of financial exigencies, social duties -- pronounce the missing end, and
the artist, freed by a dénouement of pure constraint, pursues the unfinished matter elsewhere.
The infinite nature of the work, seen thus, is just the mind's infiniteness. The mind wants to
fulfill itself in a single work, instead of realizing itself in an infinity of works and in history's
ongoing movement. But Valéry was by no means a hero. He found it good to talk about
everything, to write on everything: thus the scattered totality of the world distracted him from the
unique and rigorous totality of the work, from which he amiably let himself be diverted. The etc.
hid behind the diversity of thoughts and subjects.
However, the work -- the work of art, the literary work -- is neither finished nor unfinished: it is.
What it says is exclusively this: that it is -- and nothing more. Beyond that it is nothing. Whoever
wants to make it express more finds nothing, finds that it expresses nothing. He whose life
depends upon the work, either because he is a writer or because he is a reader, belongs to the
solitude of that which expresses nothing except the word being: the word which language
shelters by hiding it, or causes to appear when language itself disappears into the silent void of
the work.
The solitude of the work has as its primary framework the absence of any defining criteria. This
absence makes it impossible ever to declare the work finished or unfinished. The work is without
any proof, just as it is without any use. It can't be verified. Truth can appropriate it, renown
draws attention to it, but the existence it thus acquires doesn't concern it. This demonstrability
renders it neither certain nor real -- does not make it manifest.
The work is solitary: this does not mean that it remains uncommunicable, that it has no reader.
But whoever reads it enters into the affirmation of the work's solitude, just as he who writes it
belongs to the risk of this solitude. 
The Work, the Book
In order to examine more closely what such statements beckon us toward, perhaps we should try
to see where they originate. The writer writes a book, but the book is not yet the work. There is a
work only

when, through it, and with the violence of a beginning which is proper to it, the word being is
pronounced. This event occurs when the work becomes the intimacy between someone who
writes it and someone who reads it. One might, then, wonder: if solitude is the writer's risk, does
it not express the fact that he is turned, oriented toward the open violence of the work, of which
he never grasps anything but the substitute -- the approach and the illusion in the form of the
book? The writer belongs to the work, but what belongs to him is only a book, a mute collection
of sterile words, the most insignificant thing in the world. The writer who experiences this void
believes only that the work is unfinished, and he thinks that a little more effort, along with some
propitious moments, will permit him and him alone to finish it. So he goes back to work. But
what he wants to finish by himself remains interminable; it involves him in an illusory task. And
the work, finally, knows him not. It closes in around his absence as the impersonal, anonymous
affirmation that it is -- and nothing more. This is what is meant by the observation that the writer,
since he only finishes his work at the moment he dies, never knows of his work. One ought
perhaps to turn this remark around. For isn't the writer dead as soon as the work exists? He
sometimes has such a presentiment himself: an impression of being ever so strangely out of
work. 1
Noli Me Legere
The same situation can also be described this way: the writer never reads his work. It is, for him,
illegible, a secret. He cannot linger in its presence. It is a secret because he is separated from it.
However, his inability to read the work is not a purely negative phenomenon. It is, rather, the
writer's only real relation to what we call the work. The

1
This situation is different from that of the man who labors and accomplishes his task only to
have it escape him by being transformed in the world. What man makes undergoes
transformation, but it undergoes this change in the world, and man recaptures it through the
world. Or at least he can regain it if alienation is not immobilized -- expropriated for the profit
of certain others -- but is pursued rather, right up to the world's own full realization.
On the contrary, what the writer aims at is the work, and what he writes is a book. The book,
as such, can become an effective event in the world (an action, however, which is always
reticent and insufficient), but it is not action that the writer aims at. It is the work. And what
makes the book the substitute for the work suffices to make it a thing which, like the work,
doesn't stem from the truth of the world, but is almost vain, inasmuch as it has neither the
reality of the work nor the seriousness of genuine tasks undertaken in the world.

abrupt Noli me legere brings forth, where there is still only a book, the horizon of a different
strength. This Noli me legere is a fleeting experience, although immediate. It is not the force of 
an interdict, but, through the play and the sense of words, the insistent, the rude and poignant
affirmation that what is there, in the global presence of a definitive text, still witholds itself -- the
rude and biting void of refusal -- or excludes, with the authority of indifference, him who, having
written it, yet wants to grasp it afresh by reading it. The impossibility of reading is the discovery
that now, in the space opened by creation, there is no more room for creation. And, for the
writer, no other possibility than to keep on writing this work. No one who has written the work
can linger close to it. For the work is the very decision which dismisses him, cuts him off, makes
of him a survivor, without work. He becomes the inert idler upon whom art does not depend.
The writer cannot abide near the work. He can only write it; he can, once it is written, only
discern its approach in the abrupt Noli me legere which moves him away, which sets him apart or
which obliges him to go back to that "separation" which he first entered in order to become
attuned to what he had to write. So that now he finds himself as if at the beginning of his task
again and discovers again the proximity, the errant intimacy of the outside from which he could
not make an abode.
Perhaps this ordeal points us toward what we are seeking. The writer's solitude, that condition
which is the risk he runs, seems to come from his belonging, in the work, to what always
precedes the work. Through him, the work comes into being; it constitutes the resolute solidity of
a beginning. But he himself belongs to a time ruled by the indecisiveness inherent in beginning
over again. The obsession which ties him to a privileged theme, which obliges him to say over
again what he has already said -- sometimes with the strength of an enriched talent, but
sometimes with the prolixity of an extraordinarily impoverishing repetitiveness, with ever less
force, more monotony -- illustrates the necessity, which apparently determines his efforts, that he
always come back to the same point, pass again over the same paths, persevere in starting over
what for him never starts, and that he belong to the shadow of events, not their reality, to the
image, not the object, to what allows words themselves to become images, appearances -- not
signs, values, the power of truth.

Tyrannical Prehension
Sometimes, when a man is holding a pencil, his hand won't release it no matter how badly he
wants to let it go. Instead, the hand tightens rather than open. The other hand intervenes more
successfully, but then the hand which one might call sick makes a slow, tentative movement and
tries to catch the departing object. The strange thing is the slowness of this movement. The hand
moves in a tempo which is scarcely human: not that of viable action, not that of hope either, but
rather the shadow of time, the hand being itself the shadow of a hand slipping ghostlike toward
an object that has become its own shadow. This hand experiences, at certain moments, a very
great need to seize: it must grasp the pencil, it has to. It receives an order, an imperious
command. This phenomenon is known as "tyrannical prehension."
The writer seems to be the master of his pen; he can become capable of great mastery over words
and over what he wants to make them express. But his mastery only succeeds in putting him,
keeping him in contact with the fundamental passivity where the word, no longer anything but its
appearance -- the shadow of a word -- never can be mastered or even grasped. It remains the
ungraspable which is also unreleasable: the indecisive moment of fascination. 
The writer's mastery is not in the hand that writes, the "sick" hand that never lets the pencil go --
that can't let it go because what it holds it doesn't really hold; what it holds belongs to the realm
of shadows, and it is itself a shade. Mastery always characterizes the other hand, the one that
doesn't write and is capable of intervening at the right moment to seize the pencil and put it
aside. Thus mastery consists in the power to stop writing, to interrupt what is being written,
thereby restoring to the present instant its rights, its decisive trenchancy.
We must start questioning again. We have said that the writer belongs to the work, but that what
belongs to him, what he finishes by himself, is only a book: "by himself" corresponds to the
restriction "only." The writer is never face to face with the work, and when there is a work, he
doesn't know it; or, more precisely, even this ignorance is unknown to him, is only granted him
in the impossibility of reading, the ambiguous experience that puts him back to work.
The writer goes back to work. Why doesn't he cease writing? Why, if he breaks with the work, as
Rimbaud did, does this break strike us as a

mysterious impossibility? Does he just desire a perfect product, and if he does not cease to work
at it, is it simply because perfection is never perfect enough? Does he even write in the
expectation of a work? Does he bear it always in mind as that which would put an end to his
task, as the goal worthy of so much effort? Not at all. The work is never that in anticipation of
which one can write (in prospect of which one would relate to the process of writing as to the
exercise of some power).
The fact that the writer's task ends with his life hides another fact: that, through this task, his life
slides into the distress of the infinite.
The Interminable, the Incessant
The solitude which the work visits on the writer reveals itself in this: that writing is now the
interminable, the incessant. The writer no longer belongs to the magisterial realm where to
express oneself means to express the exactitude and the certainty of things and values according
to the sense of their limits. What he is to write delivers the one who has to write to an affirmation
over which he has no authority, which is itself without substance, which affirms nothing, and yet
is not repose, not the dignity of silence, for it is what still speaks when everything has been said.
This affirmation doesn't precede speech, because it prevents speech from beginning, just as it
takes away from language the right and the power to interrupt itself. To write is to break the
bond that unites the word with myself. It is to destroy the relation which, determining that I
speak toward "you," gives me room to speak within the understanding which my word receives
from you (for my word summons you, and is the summons that begins in me because it finishes
in you). To write is to break this bond. To write is, moreover, to withdraw language from the
world, to detach it from what makes it a power according to which, when I speak, it is the world
that declares itself, the clear light of day that develops through tasks undertaken, through action
and time.
Writing is the interminable, the incessant. The writer, it is said, gives up saying "I." Kafka
remarks, with surprise, with enchantment, that he has entered into literature as soon as he can
substitute "He" for "I." This is true, but the transformation is much more profound. The writer 
belongs to a language which no one speaks, which is addressed to no one, which has no center,
and which reveals nothing. He may believe that he affirms himself in this language, but what he
affirms is altogether deprived of self. To the extent that, being a writer, he does

justice to what requires writing, he can never again express himself, any more than he can appeal
to you, or even introduce another's speech. Where he is, only being speaks -- which means that
language doesn't speak any more, but is. It devotes itself to the pure passivity of being.
If to write is to surrender to the interminable, the writer who consents to sustain writing's essence
loses the power to say "I." And so he loses the power to make others say "I." Thus he can by no
means give life to characters whose liberty would be guaranteed by his creative power. The
notion of characters, as the traditional form of the novel, is only one of the compromises by
which the writer, drawn out of himself by literature in search of its essence, tries to salvage his
relations with the world and himself.
To write is to make oneself the echo of what cannot cease speaking -- and since it cannot, in
order to become its echo I have, in a way, to silence it. I bring to this incessant speech the
decisiveness, the authority of my own silence. I make perceptible, by my silent mediation, the
uninterrupted affirmation, the giant murmuring upon which language opens and thus becomes
image, becomes imaginary, becomes a speaking depth, an indistinct plenitude which is empty.
This silence has its source in the effacement toward which the writer is drawn. Or else, it is the
resource of his mastery, the right of intervention which the hand that doesn't write retains -- the
part of the writer which can always say no and, when necessary, appeal to time, restore the
future.
When we admire the tone of a work, when we respond to its tone as to its most authentic aspect,
what are we referring to? Not to style, or to the interest and virtues of the language, but to this
silence precisely, this vigorous force by which the writer, having been deprived of himself,
having renounced himself, has in this effacement nevertheless maintained the authority of a
certain power: the power decisively to be still, so that in this silence what speaks without
beginning of end might take on form, coherence, and sense.
The tone is not the writer's voice, but the intimacy of the silence he imposes upon the word. This
implies that the silence is still his -- what remains of him in the discretion that sets him aside.
The tone makes great writers, but perhaps the work is indifferent to what makes them great.
In the effacement toward which he is summoned, the "great writer" still holds back; what speaks
is no longer he himself, but neither is it the sheer slipping away of no one's word. For he
maintains the authoritative though silent affirmation of the effaced "I." He keeps the cutting
edge, the violent swiftness of active time, of the instant.

Thus he preserves himself within the work; where there is no more restraint, he contains himself.
But the work also retains, because of this, a content. It is not altogether its own interior. 
The writer we call classic -- at least in France -- sacrifices within himself the idiom which is
proper to him, but he does so in order to give voice to the universal. The calm of a regular form,
the certainty of a language free from idiosyncrasy, where impersonal generality speaks, secures
him a relation with truth -- with truth which is beyond the person and purports to be beyond time.
Then literature has the glorious solitude of reason, that rarefied life at the heart of the whole
which would require resolution and courage if this reason were not in fact the stability of an
ordered aristocratic society; that is, the noble satisfaction of a part of society which concentrates
the whole within itself by isolating itself well above what sustains it.
When to write is to discover the interminable, the writer who enters this region does not leave
himself behind in order to approach the universal. He does not move toward a surer world, a
finer or better justified world where everything would be ordered according to the clarity of the
impartial light of day. He does not discover the admirable language which speaks honorably for
all. What speaks in him is the fact that, in one way or another, he is no longer himself; he isn't
anyone any more. The third person substituting for the "I": such is the solitude that comes to the
writer on account of the work. It does not denote objective disinterestedness, creative
detachment. It does not glorify consciousness in someone other than myself or the evolution of a
human vitality which, in the imaginary space of the work of art, would retain the freedom to say
"I." The third person is myself become no one, my interlocutor turned alien; it is my no longer
being able, where I am, to address myself and the inability of whoever addresses me to say "I"; it
is his not being himself.
Recourse to the "Journal"
It is perhaps striking that from the moment the work becomes the search for art, from the
moment it becomes literature, the writer increasingly feels the need to maintain a relation to
himself. His feeling is one of extreme repugnance at losing his grasp upon himself in the
interests of that neutral force, formless and bereft of any destiny, which is behind everything that
gets written. This repugnance, or apprehension, is revealed by the concern, characteristic of so
many authors, to compose what they call

their "journal." Such a preoccupation is far removed from the complacent attitudes usually
described as Romantic. The journal is not essentially confessional; it is not one's own story. It is
a memorial. What must the writer remember? Himself: who he is when he isn't writing, when he
lives daily life, when he is alive and true, not dying and bereft of truth. But the tool he uses in
order to recollect himself is, strangely, the very element of forgetfulness: writing. That is why,
however, the truth of the journal lies not in the interesting, literary remarks to be found there, but
in the insignificant details which attach it to daily reality. The journal represents the series of
reference points which a writer establishes in order to keep track of himself when he begins to
suspect the dangerous metamorphosis to which he is exposed. It is a route that remains viable; it
is something like a watchman's walkway upon ramparts: parallel to, overlooking, and sometimes
skirting around the other path -- the one where to stray is the endless task. Here true things are
still spoken of. Here, whoever speaks retains his name and speaks in this name, and the dates he
notes down belong in a shared time where what happens really happens. The journal -- this book
which is apparently altogether solitary -- is often written out of fear and anguish at the solitude
which comes to the writer on account of the work. 
The recourse to the journal indicates that he who writes doesn't want to break with contentment.
He doesn't want to interrupt the propriety of days which really are days and which really follow
one upon the other. The journal roots the movement of writing in time, in the humble succession
of days whose dates preserve this routine. Perhaps what is written there is already nothing but
insincerity; perhaps it is said without regard for truth. But it is said in the security of the event. It
belongs to occupations, incidents, the affairs of the world -- to our active present. This continuity
is nil and insignificant, but at least it is irreversible. It is a pursuit that goes beyond itself toward
tomorrow, and proceeds there definitively.
The journal indicates that already the writer is no longer capable of belonging to time through the
ordinary certainty of action, through the shared concerns of common tasks, of an occupation,
through the simplicity of intimate speech, the force of unreflecting habit. He is no longer truly
historical; but he doesn't want to waste time either, and since he doesn't know anymore how to
do anything but write, at least he writes in response to his everyday history and in accord with
the preoccupations of daily life. It happens that writers who keep a journal are the most literary
of all, but perhaps this is precisely because they avoid,

thus, the extreme of literature, if literature is ultimately the fascinating realm of time's absence.
The Fascination of Time's Absence
To write is to surrender to the fascination of time's absence. Now we are doubtless approaching
the essence of solitude. Time's absence is not a purely negative mode. It is the time when nothing
begins, when initiative is not possible, when, before the affirmation, there is already a return of
the affirmation. Rather than a purely negative mode, it is, on the contrary, a time without
negation, without decision, when here is nowhere as well, and each thing withdraws into its
image while the "I" that we are recognizes itself by sinking into the neutrality of a featureless
third person. The time of time's absence has no present, no presence. This "no present" does not,
however, refer back to a past. Olden days had the dignity, the active force of now. Memory still
bears witness to this active force. It frees me from what otherwise would recall me; it frees me
by giving me the means of calling freely upon the past, of ordering it according to my present
intention. Memory is freedom of the past. But what has no present will not accept the present of
a memory either. Memory says of the event: it once was and now it will never be again. The
irremediable character of what has no present, of what is not even there as having once been
there, says: it never happened, never for a first time, and yet it starts over, again, again, infinitely.
It is without end, without beginning. It is without a future.
The time of time's absence is not dialectical. In this time what appears is the fact that nothing
appears. What appears is the being deep within being's absence, which is when there is nothing
and which, as soon as there is something, is no longer. For it is as if there were no beings except
through the loss of being, when being lacks. The reversal which, in time's absence, points us
constantly back to the presence of absence -- but to this presence as absence, to absence as its
own affirmation (an affirmation in which nothing is affirmed, in which nothing never ceases to
affirm itself with the exhausting insistence of the indefinite) -- this movement is not dialectical.
Contradictions do not exclude each other in it; nor are they reconciled. Only time itself, during
which negation becomes our power, permits the "unity of contraries." In time's absence what is 
new renews nothing; what is present is not contemporary; what is present presents nothing, but
represents itself and belongs henceforth and always to return. It isn't, but comes back

again. It comes already and forever past, so that my relation to it is not one of cognition, but of
recognition, and this recognition ruins in me the power of knowing, the right to grasp. It makes
what is ungraspable inescapable; it never lets me cease reaching what I cannot attain. And that
which I cannot take, I must take up again, never to let go.
This time is not the ideal immobility which the name "eternal" glorifies. In the region we are
trying to approach, here has collapsed into nowhere, but nowhere is nonetheless here, and this
empty, dead time is a real time in which death is present -- in which death happens but doesn't
stop happening, as if, by happening, it rendered sterile the time in which it could happen. The
dead present is the impossibility of making any presence real -- an impossibility which is present,
which is there as the present's double, the shadow of the present which the present bears and
hides in itself. When I am alone, I am not alone, but, in this present, I am already returning to
myself in the form of Someone. Someone is there, where I am alone. The fact of being alone is
my belonging to this dead time which is not my time, or yours, or the time we share in common,
but Someone's time. Someone is what is still present when there is no one. Where I am alone, I
am not there; no one is there, but the impersonal is: the outside, as that which prevents, precedes,
and dissolves the possibility of any personal relation. Someone is the faceless third person, the
They of which everybody and anybody is part, but who is part of it? Never anyone in particular,
never you and I. Nobody is part of the They. "They" belongs to a region which cannot be brought
to light, not because it hides some secret alien to any revelation or even because it is radically
obscure, but because it transforms everything which has access to it, even light, into anonymous,
impersonal being, the Nontrue, the Nonreal yet always there. The They is, in this respect, what
appears up very close when someone dies. 2
When I am alone, the light of day is only the loss of a dwelling place. It is intimacy with the
outside which has no location and affords no rest. Coming here makes the one who comes
belong to dispersal, to the fissure where the exterior is the intrusion that stifles, but is also
nakedness, the chill of the enclosure that leaves one utterly exposed. Here the only space is its
vertiginous separation. Here fascination reigns.

2When I am alone, it is not I who am there, and it is not from you that I stay away, or from
others, or from the world. So begins the reflection which investigates "the essential solitude
and solitude in the world." See, on this subject, and under this title, certain pages in the
Appendixes.

The Image
Why fascination? Seeing presupposes distance, decisiveness which separates, the power to stay
out of contact and in contact avoid confusion. Seeing means that this separation has nevertheless
become an encounter. But what happens when what you see, although at a distance, seems to
touch you with a gripping contact, when the manner of seeing is a kind of touch, when seeing is
contact at a distance? What happens when what is seen imposes itself upon the gaze, as if the 
gaze were seized, put in touch with the appearance? What happens is not an active contact, not
the initiative and action which there still is in real touching. Rather, the gaze gets taken in,
absorbed by an immobile movement and a depthless deep. What is given us by this contact at a
distance is the image, and fascination is passion for the image.
What fascinates us robs us of our power to give sense. It abandons its "sensory" nature, abandons
the world, draws back from the world, and draws us along. It no longer reveals itself to us, and
yet it affirms itself in a presence foreign to the temporal present and to presence in space.
Separation, which was the possibility of seeing, coagulates at the very center of the gaze into
impossibility. The look thus finds, in what makes it possible, the power that neutralizes it, neither
suspending nor arresting it, but on the contrary preventing it from ever finishing, cutting it off
from any beginning, making of it a neutral, directionless gleam which will not go out, yet does
not clarify -- the gaze turned back upon itself and closed in a circle. Here we have an immediate
expression of that reversal which is the essence of solitude. Fascination is solitude's gaze. It is
the gaze of the incessant and interminable. In it blindness is vision still, vision which is no longer
the possibility of seeing, but the impossibility of not seeing, the impossibility which becomes
visible and perseveres -- always and always -- in a vision that never comes to an end: a dead
gaze, a gaze become the ghost of an eternal vision.
Of whoever is fascinated it can be said that he doesn't perceive any real object, any real figure,
for what he sees does not belong to the world of reality, but to the indeterminate milieu of
fascination. This milieu is, so to speak, absolute. Distance is not excluded from it, but is
immeasurable. Distance here is the limitless depth behind the image, a lifeless profundity,
unmanipulable, absolutely present although not given, where objects sink away when they depart
from their sense, when they collapse into their image. This milieu of fascination, where what one
sees seizes sight and renders it interminable, where the gaze

coagulates into light, where light is the absolute gleam of an eye one doesn't see but which one
doesn't cease to see since it is the mirror image of one's own look -- this milieu is utterly
attractive. Fascinating. It is light which is also the abyss, a light one sinks into, both terrifying
and tantalizing.
If our childhood fascinates us, this happens because childhood is the moment of fascination, is
itself fascinated. And this golden age seems bathed in a light which is splendid because
unrevealed. But it is only that this light is foreign to revelation, has nothing to reveal, is pure
reflection, a ray which is still only the gleam of an image. Perhaps the force of the maternal
figure receives its intensity from the very force of fascination, and one might say then, that if the
mother exerts this fascinating attraction it is because, appearing when the child lives altogether in
fascination's gaze, she concentrates in herself all the powers of enchantment. It is because the
child is fascinated that the mother is fascinating, and that is also why all the impressions of early
childhood have a kind of fixity which comes from fascination.
Whoever is fascinated doesn't see, properly speaking, what he sees. Rather, it touches him in an
immediate proximity; it seizes and ceaselessly draws him close, even though it leaves him
absolutely at a distance. Fascination is fundamentally linked to neutral, impersonal presence, to
the indeterminate They, the immense, faceless Someone. Fascination is the relation the gaze 
entertains -- a relation which is itself neutral and impersonal -- with sightless, shapeless depth,
the absence one sees because it is blinding.
Writing
To write is to enter into the affirmation of the solitude in which fascination threatens. It is to
surrender to the risk of time's absence, where eternal starting over reigns. It is to pass from the
first to the third person, so that what happens to me happens to no one, is anonymous insofar as it
concerns me, repeats itself in an infinite dispersal. To write is to let fascination rule language. It
is to stay in touch, through language, in language, with the absolute milieu where the thing
becomes image again, where the image, instead of alluding to some particular feature, becomes
an allusion to the featureless, and instead of a form drawn upon absence, becomes the formless
presence of this absence, the opaque, empty opening onto that which is when there is no more
world, when there is no world yet.

Why? Why should writing have to do with this essential solitude, the solitude whose essence is
the dissimulation that appears it? 3

3We will not try here to answer this question directly. We will only ask: just as the statue
glorifies the marble, and insofar as all art means to draw into the light of day the elemental
deep which the world, in order to affirm itself, negates and resists, doesn't the language of the
poem, of literature, compare to ordinary language as the image compares to the thing? One
likes to think that poetry is a language which, more than others, favors images. This is
probably an allusion to a much more essential transformation -- the poem is not a poem
because it contains a certain number of figures, metaphors, comparisons; on the contrary, the
poem's particular character is that nothing in it functions as an image. So we must express
what we are seeking differently: in literature, doesn't language itself become altogether
image? We do not mean a language containing images or one that casts reality in figures, but
one which is its own image, an image of language (and not a figurative language), or yet
again, an imaginary language, one which no one speaks; a language, that is, which issues
from its own absence, the way the image emerges upon the absence of the thing; a language
addressing itself to the shadow of events as well, not to their reality, and this because of the
fact that the words which express them are, not signs, but images, images of words, and
words where things turn into images.
What are we seeking to represent by saying this? Are we not on a path leading back to
suppositions happily abandoned, analogous to the one which used to define art as imitation, a
copy of the real? If, in the poem, language becomes its own image, doesn't this mean that
poetic language is always second, secondary? According to the common analysis, the image
comes after the object. It is the object's continuation. We see, then we imagine. After the
object comes the image. "After" seems to indicate subordination. We really speak, then we
speak in our imagination, of we imagine ourselves speaking. Wouldn't poetic language be the
copy, the dim shadow, the transposition -- in a space where the requirements of effectiveness
are attenuated -- of the sole speaking language? But perhaps the common analysis is
mistaken. Perhaps, before going further, one ought to ask: but what is the image? (See, in the
Appendixes, the pages entitled "The Two Versions of the Imaginary.") 

II
Approaching Literature's Space



The poem -- literature -- seems to be linked to a spoken word which cannot be interrupted
because it does not speak; it is. The poem is not this word itself, for the poem is a beginning,
whereas this word never begins, but always speaks anew and is always starting over. However,
the poet is the one who has heard this word, who has made himself into an ear attuned to it, its
mediator, and who has silenced it by pronouncing it. This word is close to the poem's origin, for
everything original is put to the test by the sheer powerlessness inherent in starting over -- this
sterile prolixity, the surplus of that which can do nothing, which never is the work, but ruins it
and in it restores the unending lack of work. Perhaps this word is the source of the poem, but it is
a source that must somehow be dried up in order to become a spring. For the poet -- the one who
writes, the "creator" -- could never derive the work from the essential lack of work. Never could
he, by himself, cause the pure opening words to spring forth from what is at the origin. That is
why the work is a work only when it becomes the intimacy shared by someone who writes it and
someone who reads it, a space violently opened up by the contest between the power to speak
and the power to hear. And the one who writes is, as well, one who has "heard" the interminable
and incessant, who has heard it as speech, has entered into this understanding with it, has lived
with its demand, has become lost in it and yet, in order to have sustained it, has necessarily made
it stop -- has, in this intermittence, rendered it perceptible, has proffered it by firmly reconciling
it with this limit. He has mastered it by imposing measure.

Mallarmé's Experience
Here we must appeal to references that are well known today and that hint at the transformation
to which Mallarmé was exposed as soon as he took writing to heart. These references are by no
means anecdotal in character. When Mallarmé affirms, "I felt the very disquieting symptoms
caused by the sole act of writing," it is the last words which matter. With them an essential
situation is brought to light. Something extreme is grasped, something which has for its context
and substance "the sole act of writing." Writing appears as an extreme situation which
presupposes a radical reversal. Mallarmé alludes briefly to this reversal when he says:
"Unfortunately, by digging this thoroughly into verse, I have encountered two abysses which
make me despair. One is Nothingness" (the absence of God; the other is his own death). Here too
it is the flattest expression that is rich with sense: the one which, in the most unpretentious
fashion, seems simply to remind us of a craftsmanly procedure. "By digging into verse," the poet
enters that time of distress which is caused by the gods' absence. Mallarmé's phrase is startling.
Whoever goes deeply into poetry escapes from being as certitude, meets with the absence of the
gods, lives in the intimacy of this absence, becomes responsible for it, assumes its risk, and 
endures its favor. Whoever digs at verse must renounce all idols; he has to break with everything.
He cannot have truth for his horizon, or the future as his element, for he has no right to hope. He
has, on the contrary, to despair. Whoever delves into verse dies; he encounters his death as an
abyss.
The Crude Word and the Essential Word
When he seeks to define the aspect of language which "the sole act of writing" disclosed to him,
Mallarmé acknowledges a "double condition of the word, crude or immediate on the one hand,
essential on the

other." This distinction itself is crude, yet difficult to grasp, for Mallarmé attributes the same
substance to the two aspects of language which he distinguishes so absolutely. In order to
characterize each, he lights on the same term, which is "silence." The crude word is pure silence:
"It would, perhaps, be enough for anyone who wants to exchange human speech, silently to take
or put in someone else's hand a coin." Silent, therefore, because meaningless, crude language is
an absence of words, a pure exchange where nothing is exchanged, where there is nothing real
except the movement of exchange, which is nothing. But it turns out the same for the word
confided to the questing poet -- that language whose whole force lies in its not being, whose very
glory is to evoke, in its own absence, the absence of everything. This language of the unreal, this
fictive language which delivers us to fiction, comes from silence and returns to silence.
Crude speech "has a bearing upon the reality of things." "Narration, instruction, even
description" give us the presence of things, "represent" them. The essential word moves them
away, makes them disappear. It is always allusive; it suggests, evokes. But what is it, then, to
remove "a fact of nature," to grasp it through this absence, to "transpose it into its vibratory,
almost-disappearance"? To speak, but also to think, essentially. Thought is the pure word. In
thought we must recognize the supreme language, whose lack is all that the extreme variety of
different tongues permits us to grasp. "Since to think is to write without appurtenances or
whispers, but with the immortal word still tacit, the world's diversity of idioms keeps anyone
from proffering expressions which otherwise would be, in one stroke, the truth itself materially."
(This is Cratylus's ideal, but also the definition of automatic writing.) One is thus tempted to say
that the language of thought is poetic language par excellence, and that sense -- the pure notion,
the idea -- must become the poet's concern, since it alone frees us from the weight of things, the
amorphous natural plenitude. "Poetry, close to the idea."
However, the crude word is by no means crude. What it represents is not present. Mallarmé does
not want "to include, upon the subtle paper . . . the intrinsic and dense wood of trees." But
nothing is more foreign to the tree than the word tree, as it is used nonetheless by everyday
language. A word which does not name anything, which does not represent anything, which does
not outlast itself in any way, a word which is not even a word and which disappears marvelously
altogether and at once in its usage: what could be more worthy of the essential and

closer to silence? True, it "serves." Apparently that makes all the difference. We are used to it, it
is usual, useful. Through it we are in the world: it refers us back to the life of the world where 
goals speak and the concern to achieve them once and for all is the rule. Granted, this crude word
is a pure nothing, nothingness itself. But it is nothingness in action: that which acts, labors,
constructs. It is the pure silence of the negative which culminates in the noisy feverishness of
tasks.
In this respect, the essential word is exactly the opposite. It is a rule unto itself; it is imposing,
but it imposes nothing. It is also well removed from thought which always pushes back the
elemental obscurity, for verse "attracts no less than it disengages," "polishes all the scattered ore,
unknown and floating." In verse, words become "elements" again, and the word nuit, despite its
brilliance, becomes night's intimacy. 1
In crude or immediate speech, language as language is silent. But beings speak in it. And, as a
consequence of the use which is its purpose -- because, that is, it serves primarily to put us in
connection with objects, because it is a tool in a world of tools where what speaks is utility and
value -- beings speak in it as values. They take on the stable appearance of objects existing one
by one and assume the certainty of the immutable.
The crude word is neither crude nor immediate. But it gives the illusion of being so. It is
extremely reflective; it is laden with history. But, most often -- and as if we were unable in the
ordinary course of events to know that we are the organ of time, the guardians of becoming --
language seems to be the locus of an immediately granted revelation. It seems to be the sign that
truth is immediate, always the same and always at our disposal. Immediate language is perhaps
in fact a relation with the immediate world, with what is immediately close to us, our environs.
But the immediacy which common language communicates to us is only veiled distance, the
absolutely foreign passing for the habitual, the unfamiliar which we take for the customary,
thanks to the veil which is language and because we have grown accustomed to words' illusion.
Language has within itself the moment that hides it. It has within itself, through this power to
hide itself, the

1Having regretted the fact that words are not "the truth materially" -- that jour, by virtue of its
sonority, is sombre and nuit brilliant -- Mallarmé finds in this shortcoming of our various
tongues the justification of poetry. Verse is their "superior complement." "Philosophically, it
remunerates the lack in languages." What is this lack? Languages do not have the reality they
express, for they are foreign to the reality of things, foreign to obscure natural profundity, and
belong to that fictive reality which is the human world, detached from being and a tool for
beings.

force by which mediation (that which destroys immediacy) seems to have the spontaneity, the
freshness, and the innocence of the origin. Moreover, this power, which language exercises by
communicating to us the illusion of immediacy when in fact it gives us only the habitual, makes
us believe that the immediate is familiar; and thus language's power consists in making the
immediate appear to us not as the most terrible thing, which ought to overwhelm us -- the error
of the essential solitude -- but as the pleasant reassurance of natural harmonies or the familiarity
of a native habitat. 
In the language of the world, language as the being of language and as the language of being
keeps still. Thanks to this silence, beings speak, and in it they also find oblivion and rest. When
Mallarmé speaks of the essential language, part of the time he opposes it only to this ordinary
language which gives us the reassuring illusion of an immediacy which is actually only the
customary. At these junctures he takes up and attributes to literature the language of thought, that
silent movement which affirms in man his decision not to be, to separate himself from being,
and, by making this separation real, to build the world. This silence is the production and the
expression of signification itself. But this language of thought is, all the same, "ordinary"
language as well. It always refers us back to the world, sometimes showing it to us in the infinite
qualities of a task and the risk of an undertaking, sometimes as a stable position where we are
allowed to believe ourselves secure.
The poetic word, then, is no longer opposed only to ordinary language, but also to the language
of thought. In poetry we are no longer referred back to the world, neither to the world as shelter
nor to the world as goals. In this language the world recedes and goals cease; the world falls
silent; beings with their preoccupations, their projects, their activity are no longer ultimately
what speaks. Poetry expresses the fact that beings are quiet. But how does this happen? Beings
fall silent, but then it is being that tends to speak and speech that wants to be. The poetic word is
no longer someone's word. In it no one speaks, and what speaks is not anyone. It seems rather
that the word alone declares itself. Then language takes on all of its importance. It becomes
essential. Language speaks as the essential, and that is why the word entrusted to the poet can be
called the essential word. This means primarily that words, having the initiative, are not obliged
to serve to designate anything or give voice to anyone, but that they have their ends in
themselves. From here on, it is not Mallarmé who speaks, but language which speaks itself:
language as the work and the work as language.

From this perspective, we rediscover poetry as a powerful universe of words where relations,
configurations, forces are affirmed through sound, figure, rhythmic mobility, in a unified and
sovereignly autonomous space. Thus the poet produces a work of pure language, and language in
this work is its return to its essence. He creates an object made of language just as the painter,
rather than using colors to reproduce what is, seeks the point at which his colors produce being.
Or again, the poet strives -- as Rilke did during his Expressionist period, or as today perhaps
Ponge does -- to create the "poem-thing," which would be, so to speak, the language of mute
being. He wants to make of the poem something which all by itself will be form, existence, and
being: that is, the work.
We call this powerful linguistic construction -- this structure calculated to exclude chance, which
subsists by itself and rests upon itself -- the work. And we call it being. But it is from this
perspective neither one nor the other. It is a work, since it is constructed, composed, calculated;
but in this sense it is a work like any work, like any object formed by professional intelligence
and skillful know-how. It is not a work of art, a work which has art for its origin, through which
art is lifted from time's absence where nothing is accomplished to the unique, dazzling
affirmation of the beginning. Likewise, the poem, understood as an independent object sufficing
to itself -- an object made out of language and created for itself alone, a monad of words where
nothing is reflected but the nature of words -- is perhaps in this respect a reality, a particular 
being, having exceptional dignity and importance; but it is a being, and for this reason it is by no
means close to being, to that which escapes all determination and every form of existence.
Mallarmé's Experience Proper
It seems that the specifically Mallarméan experience begins at the moment when he moves from
consideration of the finished work which is always one particular poem or another, or a certain
picture, to the concern through which the work becomes the search for its origin and wants to
identify itself with its origin -- "horrible vision of a pure work." Here lies Mallarmé's profundity;
here lies the concern which, for Mallarmé, "the sole act of writing" encompasses. What is the
work? What is language in the work? When Mallarmé asks himself, "Does something like
Literature exist?," this question is literature itself. It is

literature when literature has become concern for its own essence. Such a question cannot be
relegated. What is the result of the fact that we have literature? What is implied about being if
one states that "something like Literature exists"?
Mallarmé had the most profoundly tormented awareness of the particular nature of literary
creation. The work of art reduces itself to being. That is its task: to be, to make present "those
very words: it is . . . There lies all the mystery." 2 But at the same time it cannot be said that the
work belongs to being, that it exists. On the contrary, what must be said is that it never exists in
the manner of a thing or a being in general. What must be said, in answer to our question, is that
literature does not exist or again that if it takes place, it does so as something "not taking place in
the form of any object that exists." Granted, language is present -- "made evident" -- in it:
language is affirmed in literature with more authority than in any other form of human activity.
But it is wholly realized in literature, which is to say that it has only the reality of the whole; it is
all -- and nothing else, always on the verge of passing from all to nothing. This passage is
essential; it belongs to the essence of language because, precisely, nothing operates in words.
Words, we know, have the power to make things disappear, to make them appear as things that
have vanished. This appearance is only that of disappearance; this presence too returns to
absence through the movement of wear and erosion which is the soul and the life of words,
which draws light from their dimming, clarity from the dark. But words, having the power to
make things "arise" at the heart of their absence -- words which are masters of this absence --
also have the power to disappear in it themselves, to absent themselves marvelously in the midst
of the totality which they realize, which they proclaim as they annihilate themselves therein,
which they accomplish eternally by destroying themselves there endlessly. This act of selfdestruction
is in every respect similar to the ever so strange event of suicide which, precisely,
gives to the supreme instant of Igitur all its truth. 3

2A letter to Vielé-Griffin, 8 August 1891: ". . . There is nothing in this that I don't tell myself,
less well, in the uneven whisperings of my solitary conversations, but where you are the
diviner, it is, yes, relative to those very words: it is; they are the subject of notes I have been
working on, and they reign in the furthest reaches of my mind. There lies all the mystery: to
establish the secret identities through a two-by-two which wears and erodes objects, in the
name of a central purity."
3We refer the reader to another section of this book, "The Work and Death's Space," the study 
specifically devoted to the Igitur experience. This experience can be discussed only when a
more central point in literature's space has been reached. In his very important essay, The
Interior Distance, Georges Poulet shows that Igitur is "a perfect example of philosophic
suicide." He suggests thereby that for Mallarmé, the poem depends upon a profound

The Central Point
Such is the central point. Mallarmé always comes back to it as though he were returning to the
intimacy of the risk to which the literary experience exposes us. This point is the one at which
complete realization of language coincides with its disappearance. Everything is pronounced
("Nothing," as Mallarmé says, "will remain unproffered"); everything is word, yet the word is
itself no longer anything but the appearance of what has disappeared -- the imaginary, the
incessant, and the interminable. This point is ambiguity itself.
On the one hand, in the work, it is what the work realizes, how it affirms itself, the place where
the work must "allow no luminous evidence except of existing." In this sense, the central point is
the presence of the work, and the work alone makes it present. But at the same time, this point is
"the presence of Midnight," the point anterior to all starting points, from which nothing ever
begins, the empty profundity of being's inertia, that region without issue and without reserve, in
which the work, through the artist, becomes the concern, the endless search for its origin. Yes,
the center, the concentration of ambiguity. It is very true that only the work -- if we come toward
this point through the movement and strength of the work -- only the accomplishment of the
work makes it possible. Let us look again at the poem: what could be more real, more evident?
And language itself is "luminous evidence" within it. This evidence, however, shows nothing,
rests upon nothing; it is the ungraspable in action.

relation to death, and is possible only if death is possible: only if, through the sacrifice and
strain to which the poet exposes himself, death becomes power and possibility in him, only if
it is an act par excellence:
Death is the only act possible. Cornered as we are between a true material world whose
chance combinations take place in us regardless of us, and a false ideal world whose lie
paralyzes and bewitches us, we have only one means of no longer being at the mercy either of
nothingness or of chance. This unique means, this unique act, is death. Voluntary death.
Through it we abolish ourselves, but through it we also found ourselves . . . It is this act of
voluntary death that Mallarmé committed. He committed it in Igitur.
We must, however, carry Poulet's remarks further. Igitur is an abandoned narrative which
bears witness to a certitude the poet was unable to maintain. For it is not sure that death is an
act; it could be that suicide was not possible. Can I take my own life? Do I have the power to
die? Un Coup de dés jamais n'abolira le hasard is something like the answer in which this
question dwells. And the "answer" intimates that the movement which, in the work, is the
experience of death, the approach to it and its use, is not the movement of possibility -- not
even of nothingness's possibility -- but rather a movement approaching the point at which the
work is put to the test by impossibility.

There are neither terms nor moments. Where we think we have words, "a virtual trail of fires"
shoots through us -- a swiftness, a scintillating exaltation. A reciprocity: for what is not is
revealed in this flight; what there isn't is reflected in the pure grace of reflections that do not
reflect anything. Then, "everything becomes suspense, fragmentary disposition with alternations
and oppositions." Then, just as the tremor of the unreal turned into language gleams only to go
out, simultaneously the unfamiliar presence is affirmed of real things turned into pure absence,
pure fiction: a glorious realm where "willed and solitary celebrations" shine forth their splendor.
One would like to say that the poem, like the pendulum that marks the time of time's abolition in
Igitur, oscillates marvelously between its presence as language and the absence of the things of
the world. But this presence is itself oscillating perpetuity: oscillation between the successive
unreality of terms that terminate nothing, and the total realization of this movement -- language,
that is, become the whole of language, where the power of departing from and coming back to
nothing, affirmed in each word and annulled in all, realizes itself as a whole, "total rhythm,"
"with which, silence."
In the poem, language is never real at any of the moments through which it passes, for in the
poem language is affirmed in its totality. Yet in this totality, where it constitutes its own essence
and where it is essential, it is also supremely unreal. It is the total realization of this unreality, an
absolute fiction which says "being" when, having "worn away," "used up" all existing things,
having suspended all possible beings, it comes up against an indelible, irreducible residue. What
is left? "Those very words, it is." Those words sustain all others by letting themselves be hidden
by all the others, and hidden thus, they are the presence of all words, language's entire possibility
held in reserve. But when all words cease ("the instant they shimmer and die in a swift bloom
upon some transparency like ether's"), "those very words, it is," present themselves, "lightning
moment," "dazzling burst of light."
This lightning moment flashes from the work as the leaping brilliance of the work itself -- its
total presence all at once, its "simultaneous vision." This moment is the one at which the work, in
order to give being and existence to the "feint" -- that "literature exists" -- declares the exclusion
of everything, but in this way, excludes itself, so that the moment at which "every reality
dissolves" by the force of the poem is also the moment the poem dissolves and, instantly done, is
instantly undone. This is in itself extremely ambiguous. But the ambiguity touches something
more essential. For this moment, which is like the work of the work, which outside of any

signification, any historical or esthetic affirmation, declares that the work is, depends on the
work's undergoing, at this very same moment, the ordeal which always ruins the work in advance
and always restores in it the unending lack of work, the vain superabundance of inertia.
Inertia's Profundity
Here lies the most hidden moment of the experience. That the work must be the unique clarity of
that which grows dim and through which everything is extinguished -- that it can exist only
where the ultimate affirmation is verified by the ultimate negation -- this requirement we can still
comprehend, despite its going counter to our need for peace, simplicity, and sleep. Indeed, we
understand it intimately, as the intimacy of the decision which is ourselves and which gives us
being only when, at our risk and peril, we reject -- with fire and iron and with silent refusal --
being's permanence and protection. Yes, we can understand that the work is thus pure beginning, 
the first and last moment when being presents itself by way of the jeopardized freedom which
makes us exclude it imperiously, without, however, again including it in the appearance of
beings. But this exigency, which makes the work declare being in the unique moment of rupture
-- "those very words: it is," the point which the work brilliantly illuminates even while receiving
its consuming burst of light -- we must also comprehend and feel that this point renders the work
impossible, because it never permits arrival at the work. It is a region anterior to the beginning
where nothing is made of being, and in which nothing is accomplished. It is the depth of being's
inertia [désoeuvrement].
Thus it seems that the point to which the work leads us is not only the one where the work is
achieved in the apotheosis of its disappearance -- where it announces the beginning, declaring
being in the freedom that excludes it -- but also the point to which the work can never lead us,
because this point is always already the one starting from which there never is any work.
Perhaps we make things too easy for ourselves when, tracing backwards along the movement of
our active life, content to reverse this movement, we think we grasp thereby the movement of
what we call art. It is the same facile procedure that persuades us we find the image by starting
from the object, and that causes us to say, "First we have the object, afterwards comes the
image," as if the image were simply the distancing, the refusal, the transposition of the object.
Similarly we like

to say that art does not reproduce the things of the world, does not imitate the "real," and that art
is situated where, having taken leave of the ordinary world, the artist has bit by bit removed from
it everything useful, imitable, everything pertaining to active life. Art seems, from this point of
view, to be the silence of the world, the silence or the neutralization of what is usual and
immediate in the world, just as the image seems to be the absence of the object.
Described thus, the movement in question permits itself the facilities of common analysis. This
fluency lets us believe that we grasp art, because it furnishes us with a means of representing to
ourselves the starting point of the artistic task. But this representation does not correspond to the
psychology of creation. An artist could never ascend from the use he makes of an object in the
world to a picture in which this object has become art. It could never suffice for him to bracket
that use, to neutralize the object in order to enter into the freedom of the picture. On the contrary,
it is because, through a radical reversal, he already belongs to the work's requirements that,
looking at a certain object, he is by no means content to see it as it might be if it were out of use,
but makes of the object the point through which the work's requirements pass and, consequently,
the moment at which the possible is attenuated, the notions of value and utility effaced, and the
world "dissolves." It is because he already belongs to another time, to time's other, and because
he has abandoned time's labor to expose himself to the trial of the essential solitude where
fascination threatens -- it is because he has approached this "point" that, answering to the work's
demands from within this original belonging, he seems to look at the objects of the ordinary
world in a different way, neutralizing usefulness in them, rendering them pure, elevating them
through continuous stylization to the simultaneity and symmetry in which they become pictures.
In other words, one never ascends from "the world" to art, even by the movement of refusal and
disqualification which we have described; rather, one goes always from art toward what appears
to be the neutralized appearances of the world -- appears so, really, only to the domesticated gaze 
which is generally ours, that gaze of the inadequate spectator riveted to the world of goals and at
most capable of going from the world to the picture.
No one who does not belong to the work as origin, who does not belong to that other time where
the work is concerned for its essence, will ever create a work. But whoever does belong to that
other time also belongs to the empty profundity of inertia where nothing is ever made of being.

To express this in yet another way: when an all-too-familiar expression seems to acknowledge
the poet's power to "give a purer sense to the words of the tribe," are we to understand that the
poet is the one who, by talent or by creative savoir faire, is content to change "crude or
immediate" language into essential language, elevating the silent nullity of ordinary language to
the accomplished silence of the poem where, through the apotheosis of disappearance, all is
present in the absence of all? By no means. That would be like imagining writing to consist
merely in using ordinary words with more mastery, a richer memory, or an ear more attuned to
their musical resources. Writing never consists in perfecting the language in use, rendering it
purer. Writing begins only when it is the approach to that point where nothing reveals itself,
where, at the heart of dissimulation, speaking is still but the shadow of speech, a language which
is still only its image, an imaginary language and a language of the imaginary, the one nobody
speaks, the murmur of the incessant and interminable which one has to silence if one wants, at
last, to be heard.
When we look at the sculptures of Giacometti, there is a vantage point where they are no longer
subject to the fluctuations of appearance or to the movement of perspective. One sees them
absolutely: no longer reduced, but withdrawn from reduction, irreducible, and, in space, masters
of space through their power to substitute for space the unmalleable, lifeless profundity of the
imaginary. This point, whence we see them irreducible, puts us at the vanishing point ourselves;
it is the point at which here coincides with nowhere. To write is to find this point. No one writes
who has not enabled language to maintain or provoke contact with this point.

The Work's Space and Its Demand
III



The Work and the Errant Word
What can be said about this point?
First, let us try to assemble some of the traits which the approach to literature's space has enabled
us to recognize. Language, at this point, is not a power; it is not the power to tell. It is not at our
disposal; there is in it nothing we can use. It is never the language I speak. I never express myself 
with it, I never address you, and I never invite your answer. All these features are negative in
form. But this negation only masks the more essential fact that in language at this point
everything reverts to affirmation: in this language what denies affirms. For this language speaks
as absence. Wordless, it speaks already; when it ceases, it persists. It is not silent, because in this
language silence speaks. The defining characteristic of ordinary language is that listening
comprises part of its very nature. But at this point of literature's space, language is not to be
heard. Hence the risk of the poetic function. The poet is he who hears a language which makes
nothing heard.
It speaks, but without any beginning. It states, but does not refer back to something which is to
be stated, something silent, like the meaning behind an expression, which would guarantee it.
When neutrality speaks, only he who silences it prepares the conditions for hearing; and yet what
is to be heard is this neutral word, which has always been said already, cannot stop its saying,
and to which no hearing can be given.
This is an essentially errant word, for it is always cast out of itself. It designates the infinitely
distended outside which takes the place of the spoken word's intimacy. It resembles the echo,
when the echo does not simply say out loud what first is indistinctly murmured, but merges with
the whispering immensity and is silence become reverberating

space, all words' exterior. But here the outside is void, and the echo repeats in advance,
"prophetic in the absence of time."
The Need to Write
The need to write is linked to the approach toward this point at which nothing can be done with
words. Hence the illusion that if one maintained contact with this point even as one came back
from it to the world of possibility, "everything" could be done, "everything" could be said. This
need must be suppressed and contained. If not, it becomes so vast that there is no more room or
space for its realization. One only begins to write when, momentarily, through a ruse, through a
propitious burst of energy, or through life's distractions, one has succeeded in evading this
impulse which remote control of the work must constantly awaken and subdue, protect and avert,
master and experience in its unmasterable force. This operation is so difficult and dangerous that
every writer and every artist is surprised each time he achieves it without disaster. And no one
who has looked the risk in the face can doubt that many perished silently. It is not that creative
resources are lacking -- although they are in any event insufficient -- but rather that the force of
the writing impulse makes the world disappear. Then time loses its power of decision; nothing
can really begin.
The work is the pure circle where, even as he writes the work, the author dangerously exposes
himself to, but also protects himself against, the pressure which demands that he write. Hence --
in part at least -- the prodigious, the immense joy which, as Goethe says, is that of a deliverance:
a têete-à-tête with the solitary omnipotence of fascination which one has faced resolutely,
without betraying or fleeing it, but without renouncing one's own mastery either. This
deliverance, it is true, will have consisted of enclosing oneself outside oneself. 
It is regularly said of the artist that he finds in his work a convenient way of living while
withdrawing from life's responsibilities. He is said to protect himself from the world where
action is difficult by establishing himself in an unreal world over which he reigns supreme. This
is, in fact, one of the risks of artistic activity: to exile oneself from the difficulties of time and of
active pursuits in time without, however, renouncing the comfort of the world or the apparent
easiness of pursuits outside of time. The artist often seems a weak being who cringes within the
closed sphere of his work where, speaking as master and acting without any obstacles, he can
take revenge for his failures in society.

Even Stendhal, even Balzac inspire this suspicion; Kafka, Hölderlin certainly do -- and Homer is
blind. But this perspective only expresses one side of the situation. The other side is that the
artist who willingly exposes himself to the risks of the experience which is his does not feel free
of the world, but, rather, deprived of it; he does not feet that he is master of himself, but rather
that he is absent from himself and exposed to demands which, casting him out of life and of
living, open him to that moment at which he cannot do anything and is no longer himself. It is
then that Rimbaud flees into the desert from the responsibilities of the poetic decision. He buries
his imagination and his glory. He says "adieu" to "the impossible" in the same way that Leonardo
da Vinci does and almost in the same terms. He does not come back to the world; he takes refuge
in it; and bit by bit his days, devoted henceforth to the aridity of gold, make a shelter for him of
protective forgetfulness. If it is true, as doubtful sources have it, that in his last years he would
not stand for any mention of his work or that he repeatedly said of himself, "absurd, ridiculous,
disgusting," the violence of his disavowal, the refusal to remember himself shows the terror
which he still felt and the force of the upheaval which he could not undergo to the limit. He is
reproached with having sold out and deserted, but the reproach is easy for those who have not
run the risk.
In the work, the artist protects himself not only against the world, but also against the
requirement that draws him out of the world. The work momentarily domesticates this "outside"
by restoring an intimacy to it. The work silences and gives the intimacy of silence to this outside
bereft of intimacy and repose -- this outside, this language of the original experience. But what
the work encloses is also what opens it ceaselessly; and the work in progress runs one of two
risks: it may either renounce its origin -- exorcising it by endowing it with facile prestige -- or the
work may return ever closer to this origin by renouncing its own realization. Yet a third risk is
that the author may want to maintain contact with the world, with himself, with the language he
can use to say "I." He wants this, for if he loses himself, the work too is lost. But if, too
cautiously, he remains himself, the work is his work, it expresses him, his gifts, and not the
extreme demand of the work, art as origin.
Every writer, every artist is acquainted with the moment at which he is cast out and apparently
excluded by the work in progress. The work holds him off, the circle in which he no longer has
access to himself has closed, yet he is enclosed therein because the work, unfinished, will not let
him go. Strength does not fail him; this is not a moment of

sterility or fatigue, unless, as may well be the case, fatigue itself is simply the form this exclusion
takes. This ordeal is awesome. What the author sees is a cold immobility from which he cannot
turn away, but near which he cannot linger. It is like an enclave, a preserve within space, airless
and without light, where a part of himself, and, more than that, his truth, his solitary truth,
suffocates in an incomprehensible separation. And he can only wander astray around this
separation; at the very most he can press himself hard against the surface beyond which he
distinguishes nothing but an empty torment, unreal and eternal, until the moment when, through
an inexplicable maneuver, through some distraction or through the sheer excessiveness of his
patience, he finds himself suddenly inside the circle, joins himself there, and reconciles himself
to its secret law.
A work is finished, not when it is completed, but when he who labors at it from within can just as
well finish it from without. He is no longer retained inside by the work; rather, he is retained
there by a part of himself from which he feels he is free and from which the work has contributed
to freeing him. This ideal dénouement is, however, never altogether justified. Many a work
moves us because we still see in it the imprint left by the author who has departed from it too
hastily, impatient to finish with it, fearful that if he didn't have done with it, he would never be
able to return to the light of day. In these works, which are too great, greater than those who bear
them, the supreme moment -- the nearly central point at which we know that if the author
remains there, he will die in the undertaking -- is always perceptible. It is from this mortal point
that we see the great, heroic creators depart -- but slowly, almost peacefully -- and come back
with an even step toward the surface which the firm, regular stroke of the radius permits to curve
according to the perfections of the sphere. But how many others are there who can only tear
themselves from the irresistible attraction of the center with an inharmonious violence, leaving
behind them, like scars of badly knit wounds, the traces of their successive flights, their
inconsolable returns, their aberrant comings and goings? The most sincere openly leave to
abandon what they have themselves abandoned. Others hide the ruins, and this concealment
becomes the only truth of their books.
The central point of the work is the work as origin, the point which cannot be reached, yet the
only one which is worth reaching.
This point is the sovereign requirement. One can approach it only by means of the completed
work, but one can complete the work only

by means of the approach. Those who care only for brilliant success are nevertheless in search of
this point where nothing can succeed. And whoever writes caring only for truth has already
entered the magnetic field of this point from which truth is excluded. Certain artists, through no
one knows what good fortune or bad luck, undergo its pull in an almost pure form: they have
approached this instant by chance, as it were, and wherever they go, whatever they do, it retains
them. It is an imperious and empty demand exerted all of the time, drawing them out of time.
They do not desire to write: to them glory is vain, the immortality of works of art does not
impress them, and the obligations of the calling are foreign to them. To live in the happy passion
of beings -- that is what they prefer. But their preferences are not taken into account, and they are
themselves dismissed, propelled into the essential solitude from which they do not emerge except
by writing a little. 
Everyone knows the story of the painter whose patron had to imprison him to keep him from
wasting his gifts, and who still managed to escape through a window. But the artist also has a
"patron" within himself, who shuts him in where he cannot remain, and this time there is no
escape. Moreover, this patron does not feed, but starves, him, presses him into service without
honor, castigates him for no reason, makes of him a feeble and miserable being without any
support except his own incomprehensible torment. And why? In view of a grandiose work? In
view of a completely insignificant work? He himself has no idea, nor does anyone know.
It is true that many creators appear weaker than other men, less capable of living, and
consequently more apt to marvel at life. Perhaps this is often the case. Still, one would have to
add that their strength lies in their weakness, that a new strength is born in them at the very point
where they succumb to the extremity of their weakness. And one must say still more: when,
oblivious of their gifts, they set to work, many are normal beings, amiable people firmly planted
in life, and it is to the work alone, to the demand which is in the work, that they owe this surplus
of strength which can be measured only by the greatest weakness -- this anomaly, the loss of the
world and of themselves. So Goya, so Nerval.
The work requires of the writer that he lose everything he might construe as his own "nature,"
that he lose all character and that, ceasing to be linked to others and to himself by the decision
which makes him an "I," he becomes the empty place where the impersonal affirmation emerges.
This is a requirement which is no requirement at all, for it demands

nothing; it has no content. It does not oblige anyone to do anything; it is only the air one has to
breathe, the void on which one has to get a footing, daylight worn thin where the faces one loves
best become invisible. Just as the most courageous men confront risk only through the veil of a
subterfuge, many think that to respond to this call is to answer to the call of truth: they have
something to say, a world within themselves to set free, a mandate to assume, their unjustifiable
life to justify. And it is true that if the artist did not surrender to the original experience which
sets him apart -- which in this separation separates him from himself -- if he did not abandon
himself to the boundlessness of error and to the shifting sands of infinitely repeated beginnings,
the word beginning would be lost. But this justification does not occur to the artist; it is not
granted in the experience. It is, on the contrary, ruled out. And the artist can very well know it
"in general," just as he believes in art "in general," but his work does not know it, and his search
is ignorant of it. His search is pursued in the anxiety of this ignorance.

Kafka and the Work's Demand
Someone begins to write, determined by despair. But despair cannot determine anything: "It has
always, and right away, exceeded its purpose" ( Kafka, Diaries, 1910). And, likewise, writing
cannot have as its origin anything but "true" despair, the kind that leads to nothing, turns us away
from everything, and for a start withdraws the pen from whoever writes. This means that the two
movements -- writing, despair -- have nothing in common except their own indeterminacy. They
have, that is, nothing in common but the sole, interrogative mode in which they can be grasped.
No one can say to himself, "I am in despair," but only, "You are desperate?" And no one can
affirm, "I am writing," but only "You write? Yes? You are intending to write?" 
Kafka's case is cloudy and complex. 1 Hölderlin's passion is pure poetic passion; it draws him out
of himself with a demand that bears no other name. Kafka's passion is just as purely literary, but
it is not always only literary. Salvation is an enormous preoccupation with him, all the stronger
because it is hopeless, and all the more hopeless because it is totally uncompromising. To be
sure, this preoccupation is expressed with surprising constancy through literature, and for quite a
long time

1Almost all the texts quoted in the following pages are taken from the complete edition of
Kafka's Diaries. This edition reproduces the thirteen in quarto notebooks where, from 1910 to
1923, Kafka wrote everything that mattered to him: events in his personal life, meditations
upon these events, descriptions of persons and places, descriptions of his dreams, narratives
begun, interrupted, and begun again. His is thus not only a "Journal" as we understand this
genre today, but the very movement of the experience of writing, very close to its beginning
and in the essential sense which Kafka was led to give this term. It is from this perspective
that his diaries must be read and explored.
Max Brod states that he has made only a few insignificant deletions; there is no reason to
doubt this. On the other hand, it is certain that Kafka, at many decisive moments, destroyed a
large part of his notes. And after 1923, the Diaries are missing altogether. We do not know
whether the manuscripts destroyed at his request by Dora Dymant included the continuation
of his notebooks; it is very probable they did. It

it does not differentiate itself from literature. Then, for some time it continues to be expressed in
literature, but it no longer blends with literature; it tends rather to use literature. And, since
literature never consents to become a means, and since Kafka knows this, conflicts result which
are obscure even for him -- still more so for us -- and an evolution which, difficult to elucidate, is
nevertheless enlightening.
The Young Kafka
Kafka was not always the same. Until 1922, his desire to write is very great. It gives rise to
works which do not persuade him of his gifts -- works which are less persuasive to him than his
direct awareness of devastatingly abundant, primitive forces within him with which he does
practically nothing, for lack of time, but also because he cannot do anything with them, because
he "fears these moments of exaltation as much as he desires them." In many respects, Kafka is at
this point similar to every young man in whom a taste for writing develops, who recognizes
writing as his vocation, but also recognizes that writing makes certain demands to which he has
no assurance that he will be equal. The most striking sign that Kafka is, to a degree, a young
writer

must be said, then, that after 1923, Kafka becomes unknown to us, for we do know that those
who were closest to him judged him very differently from the way he pictured himself.
The Diaries (which the travel diaries complete) reveal to us practically nothing about his
opinions on the great subjects that may have interested him. The Diaries speak to us of Kafka
at that earlier stage when there are no opinions yet, and when there is scarcely even a Kafka.
Such is its essential value. G. Janouch book, Conversations with Kafka, allows us, on the 
contrary, to hear Kafka in the relaxation of more ordinary conversations where he speaks of
the world's future, as well as of the Jewish problem, of Zionism, of religious forms, and
sometimes of his books. Janouch met Kafka in 1920 in Prague. He noted down the
conversations he reports almost immediately, and Brod has confirmed the authenticity of this
echo. But in order not to misconstrue the import of these words, we should remember that
they were spoken to a very young man, seventeen years old, whose youth, naïveté, and
confident spontaneity touched Kafka, but probably also led him to soften his thoughts in order
not to endanger such a youthful soul. Kafka, scrupulous in friendship, often feared troubling
his friends by expressing a truth which was desolating only for him. This doesn't mean that he
does not say what he thinks, but that he sometimes says what he does not think profoundly.
[For the passages cited from Kafka Diaries, I have largely depended on the English
translation by Martin Greenberg, The Diaries of Franz Kafka ( New York: Schocken Books,
1949), but frequently I have departed somewhat from his text with an eye to Blanchot's
French rendering of the original -- Trans.]

like many others is the novel he begins to write in collaboration with Brod. Such a sharing of his
solitude shows that Kafka is still skirting it. He perceives this very rapidly, as this note from the
Diaries indicates:
Max and I must really be different to the very core. Much as I admire his writings when they lie
before me as a whole, resisting my and anyone else's encroachment, still, every sentence he
writes for Richard and Samuel is bound up with a reluctant concession on my part which I feel
painfully to my very depths. At least today. [ November 1911]
If, up until 1912 he does not devote himself entirely to literature, he gives himself this excuse: "I
cannot take the risk as long as I haven't succeeded in completing a more substantial work,
capable of satisfying me fully." The night of September 22, 1912 brings him this success, this
proof. That night he writes The Verdict at one stretch. It brings him unmistakably near the point
where it seems that "everything can be expressed, that for everything, for the strangest of ideas a
great fire is ready in which they perish and disappear." Soon afterwards, he reads this story to his
friends, and the reading confirms his certainty: "I had tears in my eyes. The indubitable character
of the story was confirmed." (This need to read what he has just written to friends, often to his
sisters and even to his father, also belongs to the intermediary stage. He will never give it up
altogether. It is not literary vanity -- even though he himself denounces it -- but a need to press
himself physically against his work, to let it bear him up and draw him along, by causing it to
unfold in the vocal space which his great gifts as a reader gave him the power to create.)
Kafka knows from then on that he can write. But this knowledge is no knowledge at all, this
capability is not his. With few exceptions, he never finds in what he writes the proof that he is
actually writing. His texts are at most preludes, investigative, preliminary attempts. Of The
Metamorphosis he says, "I find it bad; perhaps there is no hope for me whatever," or later: "Great
aversion for The Metamorphosis. Unreadable ending. Almost radically imperfect. It would have
been much better if I had not been disturbed at the time by a business trip" ( January 19, 1914).
The Conflict 
This last entry alludes to a conflict that Kafka meets head-on and that exhausts him. He has a
profession, a family. He belongs to the

world and must belong to it. The world provides time, but takes it up. Throughout the Diaries --
at least up until 1915 -- there are despairing comments, where the thought of suicide recurs,
because he lacks time: time, physical strength, solitude, silence. No doubt exterior circumstances
are unfavorable: he has to write in the evenings and at night, his sleep is disturbed, anxiousness
wears him out. But it would be vain to believe that the conflict could have been resolved by
"better organization of [his] affairs." Later, when illness affords him leisure, the conflict persists;
it deepens, changes form. There are no favorable circumstances. Even if one gives "all one's
time" to the work's demands, "all" still is not enough, for it is not a matter of devoting time to the
task, of passing one's time writing, but of passing into another time where there is no longer any
task; it is a matter of approaching that point where time is lost, where one enters into the
fascination and the solitude of time's absence. When one has all one's time, one no longer has
time, and "favorable" exterior circumstances have become the -unfavorable -- fact that there are
no longer any circumstances.
Kafka cannot, or will not, consent to write "in little bits" -- in the incompleteness of
discontinuous moments. That is what the night of September 22 revealed to him. That night,
having written without interruption, he grasped in its plenitude the limitless movement which
enables him to write. "Writing is only possible thus, with that continuity, with that complete
opening of the body and soul." And later ( December 8, 1914): "Saw again that everything
written in bits, and not at one stretch in the course of the greater part or the whole of a night, has
less value, and that I am condemned by my mode of life to this lesser value." Here we have a
first explanation for the numerous abandoned narratives of which the Diaries, in their current
state, reveal the impressive shreds. Very often "the story" goes no further than a few lines;
sometimes it rapidly attains coherence and density and yet stops at the end of a page; other times
it continues for several pages, is affirmed, extended -- and nonetheless halted. There are many
reasons for this, but the first is that Kafka does not find in the time he has at his disposal the long
stretch which would allow the story to develop, as it wants to, in all directions. The story is never
anything but a fragment, then another fragment. "How, from pieces, can I weld a story capable of
springing to life?" And so, never having been mastered, never having created the proper space
where the need to write must at once be suppressed and expressed, the story cuts loose, loses its
way; it returns to the night whence it came, there painfully to retain him who was unable to bring
it forth into the light.

Kafka would require more time, but he would also need less world. The world is initially his
family, whose constraints he finds hard to put up with even though he is never equal to freeing
himself. Subsequently it is his fiancée, his essential desire to abide by the law which requires that
a man fulfill his destiny in the world by establishing a family, having children, belonging to the
community. Here the conflict takes on a new aspect. It contributes to a contradiction which
Kafka's religious situation renders particularly harsh. When, on the occasion of his betrothal to F.
B. -- which later was broken, then renewed -- he tirelessly examines, with increasing tension,
"everything for or against my marrying," he always comes up against this requirement: solitude. 
"My unique aspiration and my sole vocation . . . is literature . . . Everything I have done is a
result only of solitude . . . Married, I will never be alone again. Not that, not that." During his
engagement celebration in Berlin, "I was bound like a criminal. If I'd been tied in a corner with
real chains, policemen before me . . . it would have been no worse. And it was my engagement
party, and everyone was doing his best to bring me to life and, not succeeding, to bear with me as
I was." Soon afterwards, the engagement is broken off, but the aspiration persists -- the desire for
a "normal" life, to which the torment of having wounded someone dear lends a heartrending
force. Kafka's story and the story of Kierkegaard's engagement have been compared, by Kafka
himself among others. But the conflict is different. Kierkegaard can renounce Regine; he can
renounce the ethical level. Access to the religious level is not thereby compromised; rather, it is
made possible. But Kafka, if he abandons the earthly happiness of a normal life, also abandons
the steadiness of a just life. He makes himself an outlaw, deprives himself of the ground and the
foundation he needs in order to be and, in a way, deprives the law of this ground. His is
Abraham's eternal dilemma. What is demanded of Abraham is not only that he sacrifice his son,
but God himself. The son is God's future on earth, for it is time which is truly the Promised Land
-- the true, the only dwelling place of the chosen people and of God in his people. Yet Abraham,
by sacrificing his only son, must sacrifice time, and time sacrificed will certainly not be given
back in the eternal beyond. The beyond is nothing other than the future, the future of God in
time. The beyond is Isaac.
For Kafka the ordeal is all the graver because of everything that makes it weigh lightly upon him.
(What would the testing of Abraham be if, having no son, he were nevertheless required to
sacrifice this son? He couldn't be taken seriously; he could only be laughed at. That

laughter is the form of Kafka's pain.) The problem is thus so equivocally elusive that its
indecisiveness overtakes whoever tries to face it. Other writers have known similar conflicts;
Hölderlin struggles against his mother, who wants him to become a pastor. He cannot attach
himself to any determined task, he cannot attach himself to the one he loves, and he loves
precisely the one to which he cannot be attached. He feels these conflicts in all their force, and
they practically destroy him, but they never put in doubt the absolute demand of poetry apart
from which, at least after 1800, he no longer has any existence. For Kafka, everything is more
unclear because he seeks to fuse the work's demand with the demand which could pertain to his
salvation. If writing condemns him to solitude, if it makes of his existence a bachelor's existence
without love and without attachments, and if nonetheless writing appears to him -- at least often
and for a long time -- as the only activity which could justify him, this is because solitude
threatens in any event, both within him and outside. For the community is no longer anything but
appearances, and the law which still speaks in it is not even the law forgotten, but rather the
concealment of its being forgotten. Then writing, in the heart of the distress and the weakness
from which it is inseparable, again becomes a possibility of plenitude, a road without any goal at
the end, but capable perhaps of corresponding to that goal without any road leading to it which is
the one and only goal we must reach. When he is not writing, Kafka is not only alone -- "alone
like Franz Kafka," he will say to G. Janouch -- but a prey to a sterile, cold solitude, a petrifying
cold which he calls torpor and which seems to have been the great threat he feared. Even Brod,
so anxious to represent Kafka as a man without anomalies, acknowledges that he was sometimes
as if not there or dead. Again, this is very similar to Hölderlin: "I am dumb, I am made of stone." 
And Kafka: "My incapacity to think, to observe, to determine the truth of things, to remember, to
speak, to take part in the life of others, becomes greater each day; I am turning into stone . . . . If
I don't save myself in some work, I am lost" ( July 28, 1914).
Salvation through Literature
"If I don't save myself in some work . . . ." But why should the effort of writing be able to save
him? It seems that Kafka recognized in precisely this terrible state of self-dissolution, where he is
lost for others and for himself, the center of gravity of writing's demand. His feeling

profoundly destroyed is the first intimation of the profundity which replaces destruction with the
possibility of the greatest creation. This is a marvelous reversal, a hope always equal to the
greatest despair. And how understandable it is that he should draw from this experience
confidence he will never willingly question. Thus the effort of writing, especially in his early
years, becomes something like a means of psychological (not yet of spiritual) salvation: it is an
effort to create something "which might be linked word for word with his life, which he draws
into himself so that it might draw him from himself." He expresses this most naïvely and most
forcefully in these terms: "Today I have a great yearning to write all my anxiety entirely out of
me, write it into the depths of the paper just as it comes out of the depths of me, or write it down
in such a way that I could draw what I had written into me completely" ( December 8, 1911). 2
However somber it may become, this hope will never fail completely; always, at every period,
we find in his Diaries notes of this sort: "The firmness which the most insignificant writing
brings about in me is beyond doubt and wonderful. The comprehensive view I had of everything
on my walk yesterday!" ( November 27, 1913). At such moments writing is not a compelling
call; it is not waiting upon grace, or an obscure prophetic achievement, but something simpler,
more immediately pressing: the hope of not going under, or, more precisely, the hope of sinking
faster than himself and thus of catching hold of himself at the last minute. This, then, is a duty
more pressing than any other, and it leads him to note down on July 31, 1914 these remarkable
words:
I have no time. General mobilization. K. and P. have been called up. Now I receive the salary of
solitude. But it is hardly a salary; solitude only brings punishments. It doesn't matter, I am not
much affected by this misery, and more determined than ever . . . . I will write despite
everything, at any price: it is my fight for survival.
A Change in Perspective
And yet it is the shock of the war -- but still more the crisis set off by his betrothal, the
movement of writing and his increasingly profound involvement with it, and all the difficulties
he encounters in it -- it is his unhappy situation in general that bit by bit will shed a different light

2Kafka adds, "This is not an artistic desire."

on the existence of the writer in him. This change is never explicit; it does not culminate in a
decision; it is only an indistinct perspective. There are, however, certain indications. In 1914, for
example, he is still striving passionately, desperately toward the sole end of finding a few free 
moments for writing -- of obtaining two weeks leave to spend only writing, subordinating
everything to this single, this supreme demand -- writing. But in 1916, if he again asks for a
leave, it is in order to enlist. "The immediate duty is unconditional; become a soldier." This
project will have no results, but that is unimportant. The wish at its center shows how far Kafka
already is from the "I will write despite everything" of July 31, 1914. Later, he will think
seriously of joining the pioneers of Zionism and departing for Palestine. He says to Janouch: "I
dreamed of leaving for Palestine as a worker or agricultural laborer . . . . -- You would abandon
everything here? -- Everything, in order to find a life full of meaning in security and beauty." But
since Kafka was already ill, this dream remained a dream, and we will never know whether, like
another Rimbaud, he could have renounced his unique vocation for love of a desert where he
would have found the security of a justified life -- or, indeed, whether he would have found it. Of
all the undertakings to which he applies himself in order to orient his life differently, he himself
will say that they are nothing but broken attempts, so many radii making the center of that
incomplete circle, his life, bristle with dots. In 1922, he counts up all his projects and sees only
failures: the piano, the violin, languages, German studies, antiZionism, Zionism, Hebraic studies,
gardening, wood carving, literature, attempts at marriage, living independently, and he adds:
"When I happened to extend the radius a little further than usual -- as in the case of my law
studies or my engagement -- it was all even worse just to the degree that it represented my effort
to advance further" ( January 13, 1922).
It would be unreasonable to extract from passing notes the absolute assertions they contain, and
although he himself forgets it here, we cannot forget that he never stopped writing, that he will
keep writing right up to the end. But still, between the young man who said to the person he
considered his future father-in-law, "I am nothing but literature, and I neither can nor want to be
anything else," and the mature man who, ten years later, puts literature on the same level with his
little attempts at gardening, the interior distance is great, even if, seen from the outside, the
writing force remains constant or even appears to us stronger and more rigorous toward the end,
since to this later period we owe The Castle.

Where does this difference come from? To say would be to pose as an expert on the inner life of
an infinitely reserved man, opaque even to his friends and, moreover, not very accessible to
himself. No one can claim to reduce to a certain number of precise affirmations what for Kafka
himself could not attain the transparency of comprehensible expression. Besides, a shared set of
intentions would be necessary, and this common ground is not available. Perhaps we can at least
avoid errors with regard to what shows outwardly if we say that although his confidence in the
powers of art often remains great, his confidence in his own powers, because it is always more
harshly tested, enlightens him about the test itself, about what it demands of him, and enlightens
him especially about what he himself demands of art: no longer that it give reality and coherence
to his person, that it save him, that is, from insanity, but that it save him from perdition. And
when Kafka senses that, banished from this real world, he is perhaps already a citizen of another
world where he has to struggle not only for himself but for that other world, then writing will
begin to appear to him merely as a means of struggle -- sometimes disappointing, sometimes
marvelous -- which he can lose without losing everything.
Let us compare the following two entries. The first is from January 1912: 
I must be given credit for a very efficient concentration on literary activity. When my organism
realized that writing was the richest direction of my being, everything pointed itself that way,
and all other capacities, those which had as objects the pleasures of sex, drink, food,
philosophical meditation and especially music, were abandoned. I've thinned out in all those
directions. This was necessary, because my strength, even when gathered all together and
devoted to one aim, was so small that it could only half reach the goal of writing . . . . The
compensation for all this is clear. I will now have only to reject work at the office -- my
development being complete and I myself having nothing more to sacrifice as far as I can see --
to begin my real life . . . . in the course of which my face will finally be able to grow old in a
natural way according to the progress of my effort.
Doubtless we should not be deceived by the light tone of irony, and yet the lightness, the
insouciance are noticeable, and they emphasize by contrast the tension of this other entry whose
meaning is apparently the same (it is dated August 6, 1914):
Seen from the point of view of literature, my destiny is very simple. The sense which leads me to
portray my dreamlike inner life

has pushed all my other senses into the background, and they have atrophied terribly; they do not
cease to atrophy. Nothing else can ever satisfy me. But now my strength for portraying cannot be
counted on. Perhaps it has disappeared forever; perhaps it will come back again someday. The
circumstances of my life are not naturally favorable to it. It is thus that I waver, continually fly
toward the top of the mountain where I can scarcely maintain myself for an instant. Others waver
too, but in lower regions, with greater strength. If they threaten to fall, a relative who walks next
to them for this purpose holds them up. But I waver on the heights; it is, alas, not death, but the
eternal torments of Dying.
Three movements cross here. First, an affirmation: "Nothing else (but literature) can satisfy me."
Then, self-doubt, linked to the inexorably uncertain essence of his gifts, which "cannot be
counted on." Finally, the feeling that this uncertainty -- this fact that writing never is a power one
has at one's command -- belongs to what is extreme in the work, to the central, mortal demand,
which "is, alas, not death," which is death but death held at a distance, "the eternal torments of
Dying."
It can be said that these three movements, with their vicissitudes, constitute the ordeal which
exhausts Kafka's fidelity to "his unique vocation" and which, coinciding with his religious
preoccupations, leads him to read in the work's unique requirement something other, another
demand which tends to subordinate the first or at least to transform it. The more Kafka writes,
the less he is sure of writing. Sometimes he tries to reassure himself by thinking that "if one has
once received knowledge of writing, it cannot fail or subside but that also, very rarely, something
suddenly emerges which passes all measure." This is a faint consolation: the more he writes, the
more he nears that extreme point toward which the work tends as toward its origin, but which
cannot be looked upon by him who glimpses it except as the empty depths of the indefinite. "I
can no longer continue to write. I am up against the definitive limit, at which I must perhaps
remain for years before being able to begin again a new story which again will remain
unfinished. This fate pursues me" ( November 30, 1914). 
It seems that in 1915-1916 (however vain it may be to try to date a movement which escapes
time), the change in perspective is complete. Kafka renewed relations with his former fiancée.
These relations -- which will culminate in another engagement in 1917 and then immediately
afterward end in the sickness which becomes apparent at that

time -- plunge Kafka into torments he cannot overcome. He finds more and more that he cannot
live alone and that he cannot live with others. He is seized and obsessed by the guilt in his
situation; his existence is dominated by what he calls the bureaucratic vices -- stinginess,
indecision, a calculating mentality. He has to escape bureaucracy whatever the cost, and he can
no longer count on literature for his escape: the substance of literary efforts evaporates because
they partake of imposture and irresponsibility, and because they require solitude but are also
annihilated by solitude. Hence the decision: "Become a soldier." At the same time there appear in
the Diaries allusions to the Old Testament, and the cries of a lost man are heard: "Take me in
your arms, I am fallen very low, receive me in the depths; if you refuse now, then later." "Take
me, take me, I am only a snarl of madness and pain." "Have pity on me, I am a sinner in all the
reaches of my being . . . . Do not reject me among the damned."
Certain of these texts used to be translated into French with the word "God" added. It does not
appear. The word "God" hardly ever figures in the Diaries, and never in a significant way. This
does not mean that these invocations, in their uncertainty, do not have a religious direction;
rather, it means that the force of their uncertainty must be conserved. Kafka must not be deprived
of the reserve he always showed with regard to what was most important to him. These words of
distress were written in July 1916 and correspond to a stay in Marienbad with F. B. This visit
was at first not very happy, but in the end it brought them together intimately. A year later Kafka
is again betrothed. A month later he coughs blood. In September he leaves Prague, but the
sickness is still mild and does not become threatening until 1922 (it seems). In 1917 he writes the
Aphorisms, the only text where spiritual affirmation (in a general form, which does not concern
him in particular), sometimes escapes the test of a negative transcendence.
For the years that follow, almost nothing remains in the Diaries. In 1918, not a word. There are a
few lines in 1919 when he becomes engaged for six months to a young girl about whom we
know practically nothing. In 1920 he meets Milena Jasenka, a sensitive, intelligent young Czech
woman, capable of great liberty of mind and passion, to whom for two years he is bound by
violent feeling, full of hope and happiness at the beginning, later doomed to sorrow. The Diaries
become more telling again in 1921 and especially in 1922 when the setbacks of this friendship,
combined with the increasing gravity of his illness, bring him to a point of tension where his
mind seems to vacillate between madness and a

decisive commitment to salvation. Here we must quote two long passages. The first is dated
January 28, 1922.
A little groggy, tired from the tobogganing. Weapons still exist for me, however seldom I may
employ them, and I'm laboring toward them with so much difficulty because I do not know the
joy of using them, for as a child I didn't learn. It is not only "Father's fault" that I didn't learn, but 
also because I wanted to disturb the "peace," upset the balance, and consequently never had the
right to resurrect on the one hand someone I strove to bury on the other. It is true, I come back to
"the fault," for why did I want to take leave of the world? Because "he" wouldn't let me live in it,
in his world. Naturally, today I cannot judge clearly in this matter, for now I am already a citizen
in this other world which compares with the ordinary world just as the desert compares to
cultivated land (I have been forty years wandering from Canaan), and it is as a foreigner that I
look back. Doubtless, in this other world as well I am only the littlest and most timid (I brought
that with me, it is the paternal inheritance), and if I am capable of living out here, it is only
because of the organization proper to this wilderness -- an organization according to which, even
for the least of persons, there are elevations at lightning speeds, and also, of course, crushing
moments that last thousands of years as if under the weight of the seas. In spite of everything,
shouldn't I be grateful? Wouldn't I have had to find the road leading this far? Might not
"banishment" from one side, joined with rejection from this have crushed me at the border? And
is it not thanks to the strength of my father that the expulsion was sufficiently forceful that
nothing could resist it (it, not me)? Indeed, my situation is something like the wandering in the
desert in reverse, with continual approaches toward the desert and childish hopes (particularly
concerning women): "Perhaps I shall keep in Canaan after all?" And in the meantime I have been
in the desert for a long time, and these are only visions born of despair, especially at the
moments when, out here too, I am the most miserable of men and Canaan necessarily offers itself
as the sole Promised Land, for there is no third land for men.
The second text is dated the next day:
Attacks on the road, in the evening, in the snow. There are conflicting thoughts always in my
head, more or less thus: My situation in

this world would seem to be a dreadful one, alone here in Spindiermühle, on a forsaken road,
moreover, where one keeps slipping in the snow in the dark, a senseless road, moreover, without
any earthly goal (it leads to the bridge? Why there? In any event I didn't even go that far); I too
am forsaken in this place (I cannot consider the doctor to be any personal help, I didn't win his
aid by my merits, at bottom the fee is my only relationship to him), incapable of striking up a
friendship with anyone, unable to bear having any acquaintances, full, in fact, of an infinite
astonishment before a cheerful company or before parents with their children (at the hotel,
indeed, there is not much gaiety; I wouldn't go so far as to say that I am the cause, in my capacity
as "man with too long a shadow," but as a matter of fact my shadow is too long, and with fresh
astonishment I observe the capacity for resistance, the obstinacy of certain beings who want to
live "in spite of everything" in this shadow, right in it -- but there is much more than this to be
said on the matter); forsaken moreover not only here but in general, even in Prague, my "home,"
and what is more, forsaken not by people (that would not be the worst -- as long as I live I could
chase after them), but rather by myself vis-àvis people, by my strength with regard to them. I am
fond of lovers, but I cannot love, I am too remote, I am excluded. Doubtless, since I am
nonetheless a human being and my roots need nourishment, I have my proxies "down" (or up)
there too, lamentable and inadequate actors, who can satisfy me (it is true, they do not satisfy me
at all, and that is why I am so forsaken) only because my main nourishment comes from other
roots in other climes. These roots too are lamentable, but still, more capable of life. This brings
me to the conflict in my thoughts. If things were only as they seem to be on the road in the snow, 
it would be dreadful. I would be lost, and this is to be understood not as a threat; rather, as
immediate execution. But I live elsewhere; it is only that the attraction of the world of men is
immense. In an instant it can make you forget everything. But great also is the attraction of my
world: those who love me love me because I am "forsaken" -- not, I feel sure, on the principle of
a Weissian vacuum but because they sense that in happy times I enjoy on another plane the
freedom of movement which I lack completely here.

The Positive Experience
Commentary on these pages seems superfluous. Nevertheless we should notice how, at this date,
deprivation of the world is reversed, becoming a positive experience, 3
that of another world
where Kafka is already a citizen, where, granted, he is only the littlest and most anxious, but
where he also knows staggering heights and enjoys a freedom whose value other men sense,
whose prestige they acknowledge. However, in order not to alter the sense of such images, it is
necessary to read them, not from the common Christian perspective (according to which there is
this world, then the world beyond, the only one which has value, reality, and majesty), but
always from the "Abraham" perspective. For, as far as Kafka is concerned, to be excluded from
the world means to be excluded from Canaan, to wander in the desert, and it is this situation
which makes his struggle pathetic, his hope hopeless. It is as if, cast out of the world, into the
error of infinite migration, he had to struggle ceaselessly to make of this outside another world
and of this error the principle, the origin of a new freedom. This struggle can have no
ascertainable result. What he has to win is his own loss, the truth of exile and the way back into
the very heart of dispersion. This struggle can be compared to profound Jewish speculations,
when, especially after the Expulsion from Spain, religious minds tried to overcome exile by
pushing it to its limit. 4 Kafka clearly associated "all this

3Certain letters to Milena also allude to the element of the unknown which persists in this
terrible movement (see the studies that appeared in the Nouvelle N. R. F.: "Kafka et Brod" and
"L'Echec de Milena," October and November, 1954).
4On this subject, we must refer to G. G. Scholem book, Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism:
The horrors of Exile were mirrored in the Kabbalistic doctrine of metempsychosis, which
now won immense popularity by stressing the various stages of the soul's exile. The most
fearful fate that could befall any soul -- far more ghastly than the torments of hell -- was to be
"outcast" or "naked," a state precluding either rebirth or even admission to hell. . . . Absolute
homelessness was the sinister symbol of absolute Godlessness, of utter moral and spiritual
degradation. Union with God or absolute banishment were the two poles between which a
system had to be devised in which the Jews could live under the domination of Law, which
seeks to destroy the forces of Exile.
And again this: "There was an ardent desire to break down the Exile by enhancing its
torments, by savoring its bitterness to the utmost (even to the night of the Exile of the
Shekhina itself)" [Passages from Major Trends, 3d rev. ed. ( 1941; rpt. New York: Schocken
Books, 1978), p. 250 -- Trans.]. One could well imagine that the theme of The Metamorphosis
(as well as the obsessive fictions of bestiality) is reminiscent of, or an

literature" (his own), with "a new Kabbala," "a new secret doctrine" which "could have
developed." "if Zionism hadn't come along in the meantime" ( January 19, 1922). One
understands better why he is at the same time Zionist and anti-Zionist. Zionism is exile's cure --
the affirmation that an earthly home is possible, that the Jewish people has for its dwelling not
only a book, the Bible, but the earth, and belongs no longer to dispersion in time. Kafka wants
this reconciliation profoundly. He wants it even if he is excluded from it, for the greatness of this
rigorous conscience was always to hope for others more than for himself and not to measure
mankind's unhappiness by his personal misfortune. "Magnificent, all that, except for me, and
rightly so." He does not belong to this truth, and that is why he has to be anti-Zionist for himself,
on pain of being condemned to immediate execution and to the despair of absolute impiety. He
already belongs to the other shore, and his wandering does not consist in nearing Canaan, but in
nearing the desert, the truth of the desert -- in going always further in that direction even when,
finding no favor in that other world either, and tempted again by the joys of the real world
("particularly with regard to women": this is a clear allusion to Milena), he tries to persuade
himself that perhaps he still keeps in Canaan. If he weren't anti-Zionist for himself (that is only
said, of course, figuratively), if there were only this world, then "the situation would be
frightful." Then he would be lost right away. But he is "elsewhere," and if the force of the human
world's attraction remains great enough to draw him back to the border and keep him there as
though crushed, no less great is the pull of his own world, the one where he is free, where he has
the liberty he speaks of with a tremor, a tone of prophetic authority which contrasts with his
habitual modesty.
There is no doubt that this other world has something to do with literary activity. The proof is
that Kafka, if he speaks of the "new Kabbala," speaks of it in connection, precisely, with "all this
literature." But

allusion to, the tradition of Kabbalistic metempsychosis, even if it is not sure that "Samsa"
recalls "Samsara" ( Kafka and Samsa are related names, but Kafka rejects this comparison).
Kafka sometimes asserts that he is not yet born: "Hesitation before birth: if there is a
transmigration of souls, then I am not yet at the bottom rung; my life is hesitation before
birth" ( January 24, 1922). Let us recall that in Preparations for a Country Wedding, Raban,
the hero of this early narrative, expresses playfully the wish to become an insect (Käfer)
which could lie about in bed and escape the disagreeable duties of the community. The "shell"
of solitude seems, thus, to be the image which was to be elaborated in the impressive theme of
The Metamorphosis.

one also suspects that from here on the demand, the truth of that other world exceeds the work's
demand -- is not in his eyes exhausted by the work and is only imperfectly realized there. When
writing becomes "a form of prayer," it is implied that there are probably other forms. And even
if, as a consequence of this world's unhappiness, there were no other forms, to write is no longer
from this perspective to approach the work, but rather to wait for that one moment of grace --
Kafka acknowledged that he lay in wait for it -- when one would have to write no longer. To
Janouch, who asked him, "Do you mean that poetry tends toward religion?" he replies, "I will not
say that, but toward prayer, certainly"; and opposing literature to poetry, he adds, "Literature
strives to place things in an agreeable light; the poet is constrained to lift them into the realm of 
the true, the pure, and the constant." This is a significant response, for it corresponds to a note in
the Diaries where Kafka wonders what joy literature can still hold for him: "I can still draw
momentary satisfaction from works like A Country Doctor, provided I can still write such things
(very unlikely). But happiness only if I can raise the world into the pure, the true, and the
immutable" ( September 25, 1917). Here the "idealist" or "spiritual" demand becomes
categorical. Write, yes, continue to write, but only in order to "lift into infinite life what is
perishable and isolated, into the realm of the law what belongs to chance," as he says again to
Janouch. But no sooner is that said than this question arises: Is it possible, then? Is it sure that
writing does not belong to evil? And isn't the consolation of writing an illusion, a dangerous
illusion, one that must be resisted? "There is undeniably a certain happiness in being able calmly
to write down: suffocation is inconceivably horrible. Of course it is inconceivable--that is why I
have written nothing down" ( December 20, 1921). And doesn't the humblest reality of the world
have a solidity lacking in the strongest work?
Writing's lack of independence: it depends on the maid who tends the fire, on the cat warming
itself by the stove, even on that poor old human being warming himself. These are all
autonomous activities, ruled by their own laws; only writing is helpless, cannot live in itself, is a
joke and a despair ( December 6, 1921).
A grimace, the grimace on the face that recoils from the light, "a defense of nothingness, a
voucher for nothingness, a whiff of gaiety lent to nothingness" -- such is art.

And yet, if the confidence of his early years gives place to an attitude of increasingly inflexible
severity, still, even in his most difficult moments, when his very sanity seems threatened, when
he undergoes almost palpable attacks from the unknown ("How it spies: for example, on the road
going to the doctor's back there, constantly") -- even then he continues to see in his work, not
what threatens him, but what can help him and make salvation accessible to him.
The consolation of writing, remarkable, mysterious, perhaps dangerous, perhaps salutary: it is to
leap out of the ranks of murderers; it is an observation which is an act (Tat-Beobachtung, the
observation which has become act). There is an observation-act to the extent that a higher sort of
observation is created -- higher, not more acute, and the higher it is, the more inaccessible it is to
the rank and file (of murderers), the less it is dependent, the more it follows the laws proper to its
own movement, the more its road climbs, joyfully, incalculably. [ January, 1922]
Here literature is proclaimed as the power which frees, the force that allays the oppressions of
the world "where everything feels throttled"; it is the liberating passage from the first to the third
person, from observation of oneself, which was Kafka's torment, to a higher observation, rising
above mortal reality toward the other world, the world of freedom.
Why Art Is, Is Not, Justified
Why this confidence? One might well wonder. One could answer by reflecting that Kafka
belongs to a tradition where the highest things are expressed in a book which is writing par
excellence, 5
a tradition where the combination, the manipulation of letters has served as the
basis of experiences of ecstasy, and where it is said that the world of letters, the letters of the 
alphabet, is the true world of beatitude. 6
To write is to conjure up spirits, perhaps freeing them
against us, but this danger belongs to the essence of the power that liberates. 7

5Kafka said to Janouch that "the task of the poet is a prophetic task: the right word is a guide,
the wrong one a seducer; it is not by accident that the Bible is called Scripture."
6Hence Kafka's pitiless condemnation (which applies to himself) of Jewish writers who use
German.
7
"Yet what about this fact itself: being a poet? This act of writing is a gift, a silent and
mysterious gift. But its price? In the night the answer always jumps out at me with

However, Kafka's was not a "superstitious" mind; there was in him a cold lucidity which made
him say to Brod, as they left at the end of some Hassidic celebrations, "In fact it was more or less
the same as a tribe of savages: gross superstitions." 8 We must not, then, limit ourselves to
explanations which, while they may be correct, still do not help us understand why Kafka, so
sensitive to the deviation implied in every one of the steps he takes, surrendered with such faith
to that essential error which is writing. Nor would it suffice to recall in this connection that ever
since his adolescence, he had been extraordinarily sensitive to the influence of artists such as
Goethe and Flaubert, whom he was often ready to place above everyone because they placed
their art above everything. Probably Kafka never entirely separated himself internally from this
conception. But if the passion of art was from the beginning so strong and appeared to him for
such a long time to be salutary, this is because, from the start, and by "Father's fault," he found
himself cast out of the world, condemned to a solitude for which he had literature, not to blame,
but rather to thank -- for brightening this solitude, making it fertile, opening it onto another
world.
It can be said that his debate with his father pushed the negative aspect of the literary experience
into the background for him. Even when he sees that his work requires his ruin, even when, still
more grave, he sees the opposition between his work and his marriage, he by no means
concludes that there is in this work a fatal power, a voice which decrees "banishment" and
condemns to the desert. He does not come to this conclusion, because the world has been lost for
him ever since the beginning; real existence has been withdrawn from him, or it was never
granted him, and when again he speaks of his exile and of the impossibility of escaping it, he will
say, "I have the impression of never

dazzling clarity: writing is wages received of the diabolical powers one has served. This
surrender to obscure forces, this unleashing of forces ordinarily held in check, these impure
embraces and everything else that happens in the depths, does one still know anything about
all this when one writes stories in the full light, in the broad daylight? . . . Does the surface
retain some trace of it? Perhaps there is some other way to write? For my part, I know only
this way, in the nights when anguish torments me at the edge of sleep" (cited by Brod).
8But later, Kafka appears to become ever more attentive toward this form of devotion. Dora
Dymant belonged to a "respected Jewish Hassidic family." And Martin Buber may have
influenced him.

having come here at all, but of having been pushed already as a little child and then chained to
the spot" ( January 24, 1922). Art did not cause him this misfortune: art did not even contribute
to it, but on the contrary has shed light upon it -- has been the "consciousness of unhappiness,"
its new dimension.
Art is primarily the consciousness of unhappiness, not its compensation. Kafka's rigor, his
fidelity to the work's demand, his fidelity to the demands of grief, spared him that paradise of
fictions where so many weak artists whom life has disappointed find satisfaction. Art has for its
object neither reveries nor "constructions." But it does not describe truth either. Truth needs
neither to be known nor to be described -- it cannot even know itself -- just as earthly salvation
asks not to be discussed or represented, but to be achieved. In this sense there is no place for art:
rigorous monism excludes all idols. But, in this same sense, if art is not justified in general, it is
at least justified for Kafka alone. For art is linked, precisely as Kafka is, to what is "outside" the
world, and it expresses the profundity of this outside bereft of intimacy and of repose -- this
outside which appears when even with ourselves, even with out death, we no longer have
relations of possibility. Art is the consciousness of "this misfortune." It describes the situation of
one who has lost himself, who can no longer say "me," who in the same movement has lost the
world, the truth of the world, and belongs to exile, to the time of distress when, as Hölderlin says,
the gods are no longer and are not yet. This does not mean that art affirms another world, at least
not if it is true that art has its origin, not in another world, but in the other of all worlds (it is on
this point, we now see -- but in the notes which represent his religious experience rather than in
his work -- that Kafka takes or is ready to take the leap which art does not authorize). 9
Kafka vacillates pathetically. Sometimes he seems to do everything to create for himself a
dwelling place among men whose "attractiveness is monstrously strong." He tries to get engaged,
he gardens, he practices manual tasks, he thinks about Palestine, he procures lodgings in Prague
in order to win not only solitude but the independence of a mature,

9Kafka does not fail to denounce the temptation -- the tempting simplicity -- in the excessively
determined distinction between these two worlds: "Usually, the division (of these two worlds)
seems to me too determined, dangerous in its determination, sad and too domineering" (
January 30, 1922).

vigorous man. On this level, the debate with the father remains essential, and all the new notes of
the Diaries confirm this. They show that Kafka hides nothing from himself of what
psychoanalysis could reveal to him. His dependence on his family not only rendered him weak, a
stranger to manly tasks (as he himself affirms), but, since this dependence horrifies him, it makes
all forms of dependence just as unbearable to him -- and, to start with, marriage, which reminds
him repulsively of his parents', 10 of the family life from which he would like to free himself but
to which he would also like to commit himself, for that is obedience to the law, that is the truth,
the truth of the father, which attracts him as much as he resists it, so that "really I stand up before
my family, and in its circle I ceaselessly brandish knives to hurt it but at the same time to protect
it." "This on the one hand."
But on the other hand he always sees more, and sickness naturally helps him see: that he belongs
to the other shore; that, banished, he must not bargain with this banishment; neither must he, as 
though crushed against its border, remain passively turned toward a reality from which he feels
excluded and in which he has never even lived since he is not yet born. This new perspective
might be merely that of absolute despair, the nihilistic perspective which is too hastily attributed
to him. There is no denying that distress is his element. It is his abode and his "time." But this
distress is never without hope. This hope is often only the torment of distress -- which does not
give hope, but prevents one from getting enough even of despair and determines that
"condemned to die, one is also condemned to defend oneself right up to the last" -- and perhaps
at that point assigned to reverse condemnation into deliverance. In this new perspective, the
perspective of distress, it is essential not to turn toward Canaan. The wanderer has the

10We must quote at least this passage from a draft of a letter to his fiancée in which he specifies
with the greatest lucidity his relations with his family:
But I stem from my parents, I am linked to them just as to my sisters by blood. In everyday
life, and because I devote myself to my own goals, I don't feel it, but fundamentally this bond
has more value for me than I know. Sometimes, too, I pursue it with my hatred: the sight of
the conjugal bed, of the rumpled sheets, the night clothes carefully spread out, makes me want
to vomit; it pulls all my insides out. It's as if I were not definitively born, as if I were always
coming into the world out of that obscure life in that obscure room; it's as if I had always to
search there again for confirmation of myself, and as if I were, at least to a certain extent,
indissolubly linked to these repulsive things. This still impedes my feet which want to run;
my feet are still stuck in the formless original soup. [ October 18, 1916]

desert for a destination, and it is his approach to the desert which is now the true Promised Land.
"Is it out there you are leading me?" Yes, out there. But where is that, out there? It is never in
sight; the desert is even less certain than the world; it is never anything but the approach to the
desert. And in this land of error one is never "here," but always "far from here." And yet, in this
region where the conditions of a real dwelling lack, where one has to live in an incomprehensible
separation, (an exclusion from which one is, somehow, excluded, just as one is excluded from
oneself) -- in this region which is the region of error because in it one does nothing but stray
without end, there subsists a tension: the very possibility of erring, of going all the way to the
end of error, of nearing its limit, of transforming wayfaring without any goal into the certitude of
the goal without any way there.
The Move outside Truth: The Landsurveyor
We know that the story of the landsurveyor represents the most impressive image of this move.
From the very beginning, this hero of inflexible obstinacy is described to us as having renounced
his world, his home, the life which includes wife and children, forever. Right from the start, then,
he is outside salvation, he belongs to exile, that region where not only is he away from home, but
away from himself. He is in the outside itself -- a realm absolutely bereft of intimacy where
beings seem absent and where everything one thinks one grasps slips away. The tragic difficulty
of the undertaking is that in this world of exclusion and radical separation, everything is false
and inauthentic as soon as one examines it, everything lacks as soon as one seeks support from it,
but nevertheless the depth of this absence is always given anew as an indubitable, absolute
presence. And the world absolute, which means "separated," is in its proper place here. For it is 
as if separation, experienced in all its rigor, could reverse itself and become the absolutely
separated, the absolutely absolute.
This must be put more precisely: Kafka -- that exacting mind by no means satisfied with the
dilemma of all or nothing which he nevertheless conceives more intransigently than anyone else
-- hints that in this move outside the true there are certain rules. They are perhaps contradictory
and indefensible, but still they authorize a sort of possibility. The first is given in error itself: one
must stray and not be indolent as Joseph K. is in The Trial, imagining as he does that things are
always going to continue and that he is still in the world when, from the first sentence,

he is cast out of it. Joseph's fault, similar probably to the one with which Kafka reproached
himself at the time he was writing this book, is that he wants to win his trial in the world itself, to
which he thinks he still belongs, but where his cold, empty heart, his bachelor bureaucrat's
existence, his lack of concern for his family -- all character traits which Kafka found in himself --
already prevent him from getting a footing. Granted, his indifference yields bit by bit, but that is
a result of the trial, just as the beauty which shines in the faces of the accused and makes them
attractive to women is the reflection of their own dissolution, of death advancing in them like a
truer light.
The trial, the banishment, is no doubt a great misfortune; it is perhaps an incomprehensible
injustice or an inexorable punishment. But it is also -- to be sure, only to a certain extent (and
this is the hero's excuse, the trap he falls into) -- a given which it does no good to protest by
invoking in hollow speeches some higher justice. On the contrary, one must try to gain from it,
according to the rule which Kafka made his own: "You must limit yourself to what you still
possess." The trial has at least the advantage of making known to K. what is really the case. It
dissipates illusion -- the deceptive consolations which, because he had a good job and a few
indifferent pleasures, allowed him to believe in his existence, in his existence as a man of the
world. But the trial is not, for all that, the truth. It is, on the contrary, a process of error, like
everything which is linked to the outside, that "exterior" darkness where one is cast by the force
of banishment. The trial is a process where if one hope remains, it is for him who advances, not
against the current, in futile opposition, but in the very direction of error.
The Essential Fault
The landsurveyor is almost entirely free of Joseph K.'s faults. He does not seek to return home.
Gone is life in Canaan; effaced is the truth of this world; he scarcely even remembers it in brief,
pathetic moments. He is not indolent either, but always on the move, never stopping, almost
never getting discouraged, going from failure to failure in a tireless movement which evokes the
cold disquietude of the time which affords no rest. Yes, he goes ahead, with an inflexible
obstinacy, always in the direction of extreme error, disdaining the village which still has some
reality, but wanting the Castle, which perhaps has none, detaching himself from Frieda, who
retains some glints of life, to turn toward Olga, sister of Amalia, the doubly excluded,

the rejected -- Amalia who, still worse, in a fearful decision, voluntarily chose to be so.
Everything ought to proceed, then, for the best. But nothing of the sort. For the landsurveyor falls 
incessantly into the fault which Kafka designates as the gravest: impatience. 11 The impatience at
the heart of error is the essential fault, because it misconstrues the very trueness of error which,
like a law, requires that one never believe the goal is close or that one is coming nearer to it. One
must never have done with the indefinite; one must never grasp -- as if it were the immediate, the
already present -- the profundity of inexhaustible absence.
To be sure, it is inevitable that one should do so, and therein lies the desolating character of such
a quest. Whoever is not impatient is indolent. Whoever surrenders to the disquietude of error
loses the indifference that would exhaust time. Scarcely having arrived, understanding nothing
about this ordeal of exclusion in which he finds himself, K. sets out right away to get quickly to
the end. He won't expend any energy on the intermediaries; in their regard he is indolent. This is
probably to his credit: doubtless it demonstrates the force of his tense striving towards the
absolute. But his aberration is not any the less glaring. It consists in taking for the end what is
only an intermediary, a representation befitting his "lights."
Surely we are as deceived as the landsurveyor when we think we recognize in the bureaucratic
phantasm the fitting symbol of a superior world. This figure merely befits our impatience. It is
the palpable form of the error through which, before the impatient gaze, the inexorable force of
the evil infinite is ceaselessly substituted for the absolute. K. always wants to reach the goal
before having reached it. This demand for a premature dénouement is the principle of figuration:
it engenders the image, or, if you will, the idol, and the curse which attaches to it is that which
attaches to idolatry. Man wants unity right away; he wants it in separation itself. He represents it
to himself, and this representation, the image of unity, immediately reconstitutes the element of
dispersion where he loses himself more and more. For the image as such can never be attained,
and moreover it hides from him the unity of which it

11"There are two main human sins from which all the others derive: impatience and indolence.
Because of impatience, they were banished from Paradise. Because of indolence, they do not
return. Perhaps there is only one main sin, impatience. Because of impatience, they were
driven out, because of impatience, they do not return" (Aphorisms) [English translation from
"Reflections on Sin, Suffering, Hope, and the True Way," in Wedding Preparations, trans.
Eithne Wilkins and Ernst Kaiser, Jr. ( London: Secker & Warburg, 1954) -- Trans.]

is the image. It separates him from unity by making itself inaccessible and by making unity
inaccessible.
Klamm is by no means invisible. The landsurveyor wants to see him, and he sees him. The
Castle, supreme goal, is by no means out of sight. As an image, it is constantly at his disposal.
Naturally when you look at them closely, these figures are disappointing. The Castle is only a
cluster of village huts; Klamm, a big heavy man seated in front of a desk. There is nothing here
that isn't very ordinary and ugly. But this is the landsurveyor's good luck -- the truth, the
deceptive honesty of these images: they are not seductive in themselves, they possess nothing to
justify the fascinated interest people take in them. Thus they remind us that they are not the true
goal. In this insignificance, however, the other truth lets itself be forgotten. And the other truth is
that these images are, all the same, images of the goal; they partake of its glow, of its ineffable
value, and not to attach oneself to them is already to turn away from the essential. 
We could summarize this situation as follows: it is impatience which makes the goal inaccessible
by substituting for it the proximity of an intermediary figure. It is impatience that destroys the
way toward the goal by preventing us from recognizing in the intermediary the figure of the
immediate.
We must limit ourselves here to these few indications. The bureaucratic phantasm, all the
bustling idleness which characterizes it, and those double beings who are its functionaries,
guards, aides, messengers, who always go two by two as if to show clearly that they are only
each other's reflections and the reflection of an invisible whole; moreover, that whole chain of
metamorphoses, that methodical enlarging of the distance which is never defined as infinite but
necessarily expands indefinitely through the transformation of the goal into obstacles, but also of
obstacles into intermediaries leading to the goal -- all this powerful imagery does not represent
the truth of a superior world, or even its transcendence. It represents, rather, the favorable and
unfavorable nature of figuration -- the bind in which the man of exile is caught, obliged as he is
to make out of error a means of reaching truth and out of what deceives him indefinitely the
ultimate possibility of grasping the infinite.

The Work's Space
To what extent was Kafka aware of the analogy between this move outside truth and the
movement by which the work tends toward its origin -- toward that center which in the only
place the work can be achieved, in the search for which it is realized and which, once reached,
makes the work impossible? To what extent did he connect the ordeal of his heroes with the way
in which he himself, through art, was trying to make his way toward the work and, through the
work, toward something true? Did he often think of Goethe's words, "It is by postulating the
impossible that the writer procures for himself all of the possible"? This much at least is
strikingly evident: the fault which he punished in K. is also the one with which the artist
reproaches himself. Impatience is this fault. It wants to hurry the story toward its dénouement
before the story has developed in all its directions, exhausted the measure of time which is in it,
lifted the indefinite to a true totality where every inauthentic movement, every partially false
image can be transformed into an unshakable certitude. This is an impossible task, a task which,
if it were accomplished fully, would destroy that very truth toward which it tends, just as the
work is wrecked if it touches the point which is its origin. Many considerations restrain Kafka
from finishing almost any of his "stories" and cause him, when he has scarcely begun one, to
leave it in search of peace in another. He states that he often feels the torment of the artist exiled
from his work at the moment it affirms itself and closes up. He also says that he sometimes
abandons a story in anguish lest, if he didn't abandon it, he could never come back toward the
world, but it is not certain that this concern was in his case the strongest. That he often abandons
a story because every dénouement bears in itself the happiness of a definitive truth which he
hasn't the right to accept, to which his existence does not yet correspond -- this reason also
appears to have played a considerable role. But all these hesitations can be summarized as
follows: Kafka, perhaps without knowing it, felt deeply that to write is to surrender to the
incessant; and, out of anxiety -- fear of impatience -- and scrupulous attention to the work's
demand, he most often denied himself the leap which alone permits finishing, the insouciant and
happy confidence by which (momentarily) a limit is placed upon the interminable. 

What has so inappropriately been called his realism reveals this same instinctive effort to
exorcise the impatience within him. Kafka often showed that his genius was a prompt, a ready
one; he was capable of reaching the essential in a few swift strokes. But more and more he
imposed upon himself a minuteness, a slow approach, a detailed precision (even in the
description of his own dreams), without which a man exiled from reality is rapidly condemned to
the errors of confusion and the approximations of the imaginary. The more one is lost outside, in
the strangeness and insecurity of this loss, the more one must appeal to the spirit of rigor,
scruple, exactitude; the more one must concentrate on absence through a multitude of images,
through their determined and modest appearance -- modest because disengaged from fascination
-- and through their energetically sustained coherence. Anyone who belongs to reality can forego
all these details which, as we know, in no way correspond to the form of a real vision. But he
who belongs to the depths of the limitless and the remote, to the distress of the immeasurable,
yes, that person is condemned to an excess of measure and to strive for continuity without a
single misstep, without any missing links, without the slightest inconsistency. And condemned is
the right word. For if patience, exactitude, and cold mastery are qualities indispensable for not
getting lost when nothing subsists that one could hold onto, patience, exactitude, and cold
mastery are also faults which, dividing difficulties and stretching them out indefinitely, may well
retard the shipwreck, but surely retard deliverance, by ceaselessly transforming the infinite into
the indefinite. In the same way it is measure which, in the work, prevents the limitless from ever
being achieved.
Art and Idolatry
"Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven
above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth." Felix Weltsch,
Kafka's friend, who has spoken very pertinently of Kafka's struggle against impatience, thinks
that he took the Biblical commandment to heart. If this is so, then imagine a man upon whom
this essential interdiction weighs, who must, on pain of death, exile himself from images and
who, suddenly, discovers himself exiled in the imaginary without any dwelling place or
subsistence except images and the space of images. There he is, then, obliged to live off his death
and constrained in his despair, and in order

to escape despair -- immediate execution -- to make of his condemnation the only road to
salvation. Was Kafka consciously this man? No one can say. Sometimes one has the feeling that
the more he seeks to remember the essential prohibition (for it is in any case forgotten, since the
community in which it was alive is more or less destroyed) -- the more he seeks to remember the
religious sense which lives hidden in this prohibition, and seeks this with an ever greater rigor,
emptying himself and the space all around him so that idols might find no welcome there, the
more he seems prepared, contradictorily, to forget that this interdiction ought also to be applied
to his art. The result is a very unstable equilibrium. This equilibrium, in the illegitimate solitude
which is his, allows him to be faithful to an ever more rigorous spiritual monism while
abandoning himself to a certain artistic idolatry. Then it commits him to purifying this idolatry
by all the rigors of an asceticism which condemns literary realities (he leaves his works
unfinished, is unwilling to publish, refuses to believe himself a writer, etc.), and which 
furthermore -- this is still more grave -- tends to subordinate art to his spiritual condition. Art is
not religion, "it doesn't even lead to religion." But in the time of distress which is ours, the time
when the gods are missing, the time of absence and exile, art is justified, for it is the intimacy of
this distress: the effort to make manifest, through the image, the error of the imaginary, and
eventually the ungraspable, forgotten truth which hides behind this error.
That there is, in Kafka, a tendency at first to let literature's demand relieve religion's and then,
especially toward the end, an inclination to allow his religious experience to take over from his
literary one -- that there is in him a tendency to mix the two in a rather confusing way by passing
from the desert of faith to faith in a world which is no longer the desert but another world, where
liberty will be returned to him -- all this is suggested by the notes in the Diaries. "Do I live now
in the other world? Do I dare say it?" ( January 30, 1922). On one of the pages we have quoted,
Kafka recalls that according to him men have no other choice than this one: either to seek the
Promised Land in Canaan or to seek it in the other world, which is the desert, "for," he adds,
"there is no third land for men." Certainly there is not, but perhaps one should say more. Perhaps
it must be said that the artist -- the man Kafka also wanted to be, the "poet," concerned for his art
and in search of its origin -- is he for whom there exists not even one world. For there exists for
him only the outside, the glistening flow of the eternal outside.



IV
The Work and Death's Space



Death as Possibility
The Word Experience
The work draws whoever devotes himself to it toward the point where it withstands its
impossibility. The work comes through this test and is, in this respect, experience. But what does
that word mean? In a passage from Malte, Rilke says that "poetry is not sentiment, it is
experience. In order to write a single line, one must have seen many cities, men and things."
Rilke does not mean, however, that poetry is the expression of a rich personality, capable of
living and of having lived. Memories are necessary, but only that they may be forgotten: in order
that in this forgetfulness -- in the silence of a profound metamorphosis -- there might at last be
born a word, the first word of a poem. "Experience" here means contact with being, renewal of
oneself in this contact -- an experiment, but one that remains undetermined.
Valéry writes in a letter: "All his life the true painter seeks painting: the true poet, Poetry, etc.
For these are not determined activities. In them one must create the need, the goal, the means, 
and even the obstacles." Valéry is alluding here to another form of experience. Poetry is not
granted the poet as a truth and a certainty against which he could measure himself. He does not
know whether he is a poet, but neither does he know what poetry is, or even whether it is. It
depends on him, on his search. And this dependence does not make him master of what he seeks;
rather, it makes him uncertain of himself and as if nonexistent. Every work, and each moment of
the work, puts everything into question all over again; and thus he who must live only for the
work has no way to live. Whatever he does, the work withdraws him from what he does and
from what he can do.
Apparently these remarks take into consideration only the technical activity in the work. They
imply that art is difficult, that the

artist, in the practice of his art, lives on uncertainty. In his almost naïve concern to protect poetry
from insoluble problems, Valéry tried to present it as an activity all the more demanding in that it
has few secrets and is little able to seclude itself in the vagueness of its profundity. Poetry, in his
eyes, is a convention which envies mathematics and appears to require nothing but uninterrupted
effort or attention. It seems, then, that art, this strange activity which has to create everything --
need, goal, means -- above all creates for itself what hampers it, what renders it not only
supremely difficult, but also useless to all living beings and especially to one living being in
particular, the artist. This activity is not even a game, although it has the innocence and vanity of
games. Yet there comes a moment when it appears as the most necessary of all activities. Poetry
is only an exercise, but this exercise is the mind, the mind's purity, the pure point at which
consciousness -- that empty power to exchange itself for everything -- becomes a real power,
enclosing its infinite number of constructs and the whole range of its maneuvers within strict
limits. Art now has a goal, and this goal is the mind's mastery. And Valéry considers that his
poems have no interest for him other than that of teaching him how they were fashioned, how a
work of the mind is produced. Art has a goal; it is this very goal. It is not simply a way of
exercising the mind; it is mind -- which is nothing if it is not a work. And what is the work? The
exceptional moment when possibility becomes power, when the mind -- law or empty form rich
only in undetermined potentiality -- becomes the certainty of a realized form, becomes this body
which is form and this beautiful form which is a lovely body. The work is mind, and the mind is
the passage, within the work, from the supreme indeterminacy to the determination of that
extreme. This unique passage is real only in the work -- in the work which is never real, never
finished, since it is only the realization of the mind's infiniteness. The mind, then, sees once
again in the work only an opportunity to recognize and exercise itself ad infinitum. Thus we
return to our point of departure.
This movement, and the terrible constraint, so to speak, which makes it circular, show that one
can never simply make an allowance for artistic experience. Reduced to a purely formal
investigation, it makes form the ambiguous point through which everything passes. 1
Everything
becomes enigma, an enigma with which there is no possible compromise, for it

1Valéry's singularity is that he gives to the work the name "mind," but mind equivocally
conceived by him as form: form which sometimes has the sense of an empty

requires that one do and be nothing which it has not drawn into itself. "All his life the true
painter seeks painting; the true poet, Poetry." "All his life": those are three demanding words.
They do not mean that the painter turns his life into painting or that he tries to discover painting
in his life. Yet neither do they mean that life remains intact when through and through it becomes
the search for an activity which is sure neither of its goals nor of its means but only of this
uncertainty and of the absolute passion which it commands.
We have two answers so far. Poetry is experience, linked to a vital approach, to a movement
which is accomplished in the serious, purposeful course of life. In order to write a single line,
one must have exhausted life. And now, the other answer: to write a single line, one must have
exhausted art, one must have exhausted one's life in the search for art. These two answers share
the idea that art is experience because it is experimental: because it is a search -- an investigation
which is not undetermined but is, rather, determined by its indeterminacy, and involves the
whole of life, even if it seems to know nothing of life.
Yet another answer would be André Gide's: "I wanted to indicate in Tentative amoureuse the
influence of the book upon the writer, during the writing itself. For, emerging from us, it changes
us, it modifies the course of our life". 2
This answer, however, is more limited. Writing changes
us. We do not write according to what we are; we are according to what we write. But where
does what is written come from? Still from us? From a possibility in ourselves which is
discovered and affirmed only through literary endeavors? All endeavors transform us; every
action we accomplish acts upon us. Does the act which consists in making a book modify us
more profoundly? And if so, is it really the act itself, the effort, the patience, the attention in this
act which is responsible for the change? Is it not rather a question of a more original demand, a
necessary prior

2
Thirty years later, Gide returns to this point of view and refines it: "It seems to me that each
of my books was not so much the product of a new inner disposition, as, on the
x
power, a capacity of substitution which precedes and makes possible an infinite number of
realizable objects -- while at other times it has the plastic, concrete reality of a realized form.
In the first instance, it is mind which is the master of forms; in the second, it is body which is
mind's form and power. Poetry, creation, is thus the ambiguity of one and the other. As mind,
poetry is only pure intellectual exercise and tends to accomplish nothing; it is the empty,
though admirable, movement of the indefinite. But as already embodied and formed, as the
form and reality of a beautiful body, poetry is as if indifferent to "meaning," to mind. In
language as body, in the physicalness of language, poetry tends only toward the perfection of
a finished thing.

change which is perhaps achieved through the work, toward which the work leads us but which,
through an essential contradiction, is not just prior to the work's completion but goes back even
further to the point where nothing can be done at all? "I no longer have any personality other
than the one which suits this work." But what suits the work is perhaps that "I" have no
personality. Clemens Brentano, in his novel Godwi, speaks eloquently of "the nullification of
oneself" which is effected in the work. And perhaps it is a question of a still more radical change
which does not consist in a new disposition of the soul and mind, which is not limited to 
removing me from myself, "nullifying" me, and which is not linked to the particular content of a
given book either, but rather to the fundamental demand of the work.
To Die Content
Kafka, in a note from his Diaries, makes a remark which bears reflection:
On the way home, I said to Max that on my deathbed, provided the suffering is not too great, I
will be very content. I forgot to add, and later I omitted this on purpose, that the best of what I
have written is based upon this capacity to die content. All the good passages, the strongly
convincing ones, are about someone who is dying and who finds it very hard and sees in it an
injustice. This, at least in my opinion, is all very moving for the reader. But for me, since I think
I can be content on my deathbed, such descriptions are secretly a game. I even enjoy dying in the
character who is dying. Thus I calculatingly exploit the reader's attention which I have
concentrated upon death; I keep a much clearer head than he, who will lament, I suppose, on his
deathbed. My lamentation is thus as perfect as possible. It does not interrupt itself abruptly the
way real lamentation does, rather it follows its beautiful, pure course.
This is dated December, 1914. One cannot be sure that it expresses a point of view which Kafka
would still have entertained later. It is, in

x
contrary, its cause and the first provocation of that disposition of soul and mind in which I
had to maintain myself in order to bring the book's elaboration to a successful finish. I would
like to express this in a simpler fashion: the book, as soon as it is conceived, disposes of me
entirely; and all within me, including the most profound in me, orchestrates itself for the
book. I have no personality other than that which suits this work" ( Journals, July 1922).

fact, what he keeps quiet about, as if he were aware of its offensive aspect. But, precisely
because of its irritating insincerity, it is revealing. The whole passage might be summarized as
follows: you cannot write unless you remain your own master before death; you must have
established with death a relation of sovereign equals. If you lose face before death, if death is the
limit of your self-possession, then it slips the words out from under the pen, it cuts in and
interrupts. The writer no longer writes, he cries out -- an awkward, confused cry which no one
understands and which touches no one. Kafka feels deeply here that art is a relation with death.
Why death? Because death is the extreme. He who includes death among all that is in his control
controls himself extremely. He is linked to the whole of his capability; he is power through and
through. Art is mastery of the supreme moment, supreme mastery.
The sentence, "The best of what I have written is based on this capacity to die content," has an
attractive aspect stemming from its simplicity; nevertheless, it remains difficult to accept. What
is this capacity? What is it that gives Kafka this assurance? Has he already come close enough to
death to know how he will bear himself when he faces it? He seems to suggest that in the "good
passages" of his writings -- where someone is dying, dying an unjust death -- he is himself at
stake. Is it a matter, then, of an approach toward death accomplished under the cover of writing?
The text does not say exactly that. It probably indicates an intimacy between the unhappy death
which occurs in the work and the writer who enjoys this death. It excludes the cold, distant
relation which allows an objective description. A narrator, if he knows the art of moving people, 
can recount in a devastating manner devastating events which are foreign to him. The problem in
that case is one of rhetoric and the right one may or may not have to use it. But the mastery of
which Kafka speaks is different, and the calculating tactic which authorizes it is more profound.
Yes, one has to die in the dying character, truth demands this. But one must be capable of
satisfaction in death, capable of finding in the supreme dissatisfaction supreme satisfaction, and
of maintaining, at the instant of dying, the clearsightedness which comes from such a balance.
Contentment is then very close to Hegelian wisdom, if the latter consists in making satisfaction
and self-consciousness coincide, in finding in extreme negativity -- in death become possibility,
project, and time -- the measure of the absolutely positive.
Yet here Kafka does not situate himself directly in so ambitious a perspective. Neither, when he
links his capacity to write well with the

power to die well, does he allude to a conception which would concern death in general. Rather,
he alludes to his own experience. For one reason or another he lies down untroubled upon his
death bed, and that is why he can direct upon his heroes an untroubled gaze and share their death
with clear-sighted intimacy. Which of his writings is he thinking of? Probably In der
Strafkolonie, In the Penal Colony. A few days earlier he had presented to his friends a reading of
this story, which gave him courage. He then writes The Trial, and several unfinished narratives
which do not concern death directly. We should mention The Metamorphosis and The Verdict as
well. To recall these works is to recognize that Kafka is not thinking of a realistic description of
death scenes. In all these narratives, those who die do so in a few quick and silent words. This
confirms the idea that not just when they die but apparently while they are alive Kafka's heroes
carry out their actions in death's space, and that it is to the indefinite time of "dying" that they
belong. They are experiencing, feeling this strangeness out, and Kafka, in them, is also standing
a test. But it seems to him that he won't be able to bring it to a "happy conclusion," draw from it
a story and a work unless, in a certain way, he is in tune beforehand with the extreme moment of
this trial -- unless he is death's equal.
What disturbs us in his reflection is that it seems to authorize art to cheat. Why describe as unjust
an event that he himself feels capable of welcoming with equanimity? Why does he make death
frightful for us when he is content with it? This gives the text a cruel shallowness. Perhaps art
demands that one play with death; perhaps it introduces a game, a bit of play in the situation that
no longer allows for tactics or mastery. But what does this play mean? "Art flies around the truth,
with the decided intention not to burn itself." Here it flies around death. It does not burn itself,
but makes us feel the burn and becomes what burns and moves us -- coldly and falsely. This
perspective would suffice to condemn art. But to be fair to Kafka's remark, one must also take it
differently. To die content is not in his eyes an attitude that is good in itself, for what it expresses
primarily is discontent with life, exclusion from the happiness of living -- that happiness which
one must desire and love above everything. "The capacity to die content" implies that relations
with the normal world are now and henceforth severed. Kafka is in a sense already dead. This is
given him, as exile was given him; and this gift is linked to that of writing. Naturally, the fact of
being exiled from normal possibilities does not in itself afford mastery over the extreme
possibility. The fact of being deprived of life does not

guarantee the happy possession of death; it does not make death acceptable except in a negative
fashion (one is content to finish with the discontent of life). Hence the insufficiency and the
superficial character of the remark. But the same year precisely, and twice over Kafka writes in
his Diary, "I do not separate myself from men in order to live in peace, but in order to be able to
die in peace." This separation, this need for solitude is imposed upon him by his work. "If I do
not save myself in some work, I am lost. Do I know this distinctly enough? I do not hide from
men because I want to live peacefully, but because I want to perish peacefully." The work in
question is writing. Kafka cuts himself off from the world in order to write, and he writes in
order to die in peace. Here death, tranquil death, is represented as the wages of art; it is the aim
and the justification of writing. Write to perish peacefully. Yes, but how to write? What allows
one to write? We know the answer: you cannot write unless you are able to die content. The
contradiction situates us back in the profundity of the experience.
The Circle
Whenever thought is caught in a circle, this is because it has touched upon something original, its
point of departure beyond which it cannot move except to return. Perhaps we would come closer
to that original movement if we modified the focus of Kafka's formulae by removing the words
"peacefully" and "content." The writer, then, is one who writes in order to be able to die, and he
is one whose power to write comes from an anticipated relation with death. The contradiction
subsists, but is seen in a different light. Just as the poet only exists once the poem faces him, only
after the poem, as it were -- although it is necessary that first there be a poet in order for there to
be a poem -- so one senses that if Kafka goes toward the power of dying through the work which
he writes, the work itself is by implication an experience of death which he apparently has to
have been through already in order to reach the work and, through the work, death. But one can
also sense that the movement which, in the work, is the approach to death, death's space and its
use, is not exactly the same movement which would lead the writer to the possibility of dying.
One can even suppose that the particularly strange relations between artist and work, which
make the work depend on him who is only possible within the work -- one can even suppose that
such an anomaly stems from the experience which overpowers the form of time, but stems more
profoundly still from the ambiguity of that experience, from its double

aspect which Kafka expresses with too much simplicity in the sentences we ascribe to him: Write
to be able to die -- Die to be able to write. These words close us into their circular demand; they
oblige us to start from what we want to find, to seek nothing but the point of departure, and thus
to make this point something we approach only by quitting it. But they also authorize this hope:
the hope, where the interminable emerges, of grasping the term, of bringing it forth.
Naturally, Kafka's words may seem to express a somber view peculiar to him. They are in
conflict with generally accepted ideas about art and the work of art which André Gide, in the
wake of so many others, called upon: "The reasons which lead me to write are many, and the
most important are, it seems to me, the most secret. Especially, perhaps, this one: to shelter
something from death" ( Journals, July 27, 1922). To write in order not to die, to entrust oneself
to the survival of the work: this motive is apparently what keeps the artist at his task. Genius
confronts death; the work is death rendered vain, or transfigured, or, in the evasive words of
Proust, made "less bitter," "less inglorious," and "perhaps less probable." Perhaps. We will not 
rebut these traditional dreams attributed to creators by remarking that they are recent -- that,
belonging to our modern, occidental world, they are connected to the development of humanistic
art, where man seeks to glorify himself in his works and to act in them, perpetuating himself in
this action. All this is certainly important and meaningful. But art, at this juncture, is no longer
anything but a memorable way of becoming one with history. Great historical figures, heroes,
great men of war no less than artists shelter themselves from death in this way: they enter the
memory of peoples; they are examples, active presences. This form of individualism soon ceases
to be satisfying. It soon becomes clear that if what is important is primarily the process which is
history -- action in the world, the common striving toward truth -- it is vain to want to remain
oneself above and beyond one's disappearance, vain to desire immutable stability in a work
which would dominate time. This is vain and, moreover, the opposite of what one wants, which
is not to subsist in the leisurely eternity of idols, but to change, to disappear in order to cooperate
in the universal transformation: to act anonymously and not to be a pure, idle name. From this
perspective, creators' dreams of living on through their works appear not only small-minded but
mistaken, and any true action, accomplished anonymously in the world and for the sake of the
world's ultimate perfection, seems to affirm a

triumph over death that is more rigorous, more certain. At least such action is free of the
wretched regret that one cannot be oneself for longer.
These dreams, which are so strong and which are linked to a transformation of art at a time when
art is not yet present to itself -- at a time when man, who believes he is the master of art, wants to
make himself present, wants to be the one who creates and by creating escapes destruction even
if only just barely -- these dreams, then, are striking in this: they show "creators" engaged in a
profound relation with death. And this relation, despite appearances, is the one Kafka pursued
also. Both he and they want death to be possible: he in order to grasp it, they in order to hold it at
a distance. The differences are negligible. They are set in one perspective, which is the
determination to establish with death a relation of freedom.
Can I Die?
At first glance, the preoccupation of the writer who writes in order to be able to die is an affront
to common sense. It would seem we can be sure of at least one event: it will come without any
approach on our part, without our bestirring ourselves at all; yes, it will come. That is true, but at
the same time it is not true, and indeed quite possibly it lacks truth altogether. At least it does not
have the kind of truth which we feel in the world, which is the measure of our action and of our
presence in the world. What makes me disappear from the world cannot find its guarantee there;
and thus, in a way, having no guarantee, it is not certain. This explains why no one is linked to
death by real certitude. No one is sure of dying. No one doubts death, but no one can think of
certain death except doubtfully. For to think of death is to introduce into thought the supremely
doubtful, the brittleness of the unsure. It is as if in order to think authentically upon the certainty
of death, we had to let thought sink into doubt and inauthenticity, or yet again as if when we
strive to think on death, more than our brain -- the very substance and truth of thought itself --
were bound to crumble. This in itself indicates that if men in general do not think about death, if
they avoid confronting it, it is doubtless in order to flee death and hide from it, but that this 
escape is possible only because death itself is perpetual flight before death, and because it is the
deep of dissimulation. Thus to hide from it is in a certain way to hide in it.
So the ability to die ceases to be a meaningless issue, and we can understand how a man's goal
might be the search for death's possibility. This search, however, only becomes significant when
it is necessary. In

the great religious systems, death is an important event, but it does not have the paradoxical
character of a brute fact bearing no truth. It is a relation to another world where, precisely, truth
is believed to have its origin. It is the true way, and if it lacks the guarantee of the
comprehensible certitudes which are ours here in this world, it does have the guarantee of the
incomprehensible but unshakable certitudes of the eternal. Thus in the great religious systems of
the West, it is not at all difficult to hold that death is true. Death always takes place in a world, it
is an event of the greatest world, an event which can be located and which gives us a location.
Can I die? Have I the power to die? This question has no force except when all the escape routes
have been rejected. It is when he concentrates exclusively upon himself in the certainty of his
mortal condition that man's concern is to make death possible. It does not suffice for him that he
is mortal; he understands that he has to become mortal, that he must be mortal twice over:
sovereignly, extremely mortal. That is his human vocation. Death, in the human perspective, is
not a given, it must be achieved. It is a task, one which we take up actively, one which becomes
the source of our activity and mastery. Man dies, that is nothing. But man is, starting from his
death. He ties himself tight to his death with a tie of which he is the judge. He makes his death;
he makes himself mortal and in this way gives himself the power of a maker and gives to what
he makes its meaning and its truth. The decision to be without being is possibility itself: the
possibility of death. Three systems of thought -- Hegel's, Nietzsche's, Heidegger's -- which
attempt to account for this decision and which therefore seem, however much they may oppose
each other, to shed the greatest light on the destiny of modern man, are all attempts at making
death possible.
Kirilov
It would seem that the most immediately pressing consequence of such an attitude is to make us
wonder whether, among all the forms of death, there is not one which is more human, more
mortal, and whether voluntary death is not perhaps an exemplary death. To take one's own life: is
this not the shortest road from man to himself, from animal to man and, as Kirilov will add, from
man to God? "I recommend my death to you, voluntary death, which comes to me because I
want it to." "To eliminate oneself is the most praiseworthy of acts; it

practically grants us the right to live." Natural death is death "in the most contemptible
conditions, a death which is not free, which does not come when it should, a coward's death.
Love of life should make us wish for an altogether different death, a free and conscious death,
one which is no accident and holds no surprises." Nietzsche's words resound like an echo of
liberty. One doesn't kill oneself, but one can. This is a marvelous resource. Without this supply
of oxygen close at hand we would smother, we could no longer live. Having death within reach, 
docile and reliable, makes life possible, for it is exactly what provides air, space, free and joyful
movement: it is possibility.
Voluntary death appears to pose a moral problem: it accuses and it condemns; it makes a final
judgment. Or else it seems a challenge in defiance of an exterior omnipotence. "I will kill myself
to affirm my insubordination, my new and terrifying liberty." What is new in Kirilov's
undertaking is that he not only considers himself to be rising up against God by taking his own
life, but expects by so doing to prove the nonexistence of this God -- to prove it for himself just
as he demonstrates it to others. As long as he has not killed himself, he himself does not know
how this matter stands. Perhaps he is a believer, "having more faith even than a priest," suggests
Dostoyevsky, apparently abandoning him to forlorn wanderings among contradictory feelings.
Yet this remark is not inconsistent. On the contrary. For it is his preoccupation with God -- the
urgency of his need to become certain about God's nonexistence -- that suggests suicide to
Kirilov. Why suicide? If he dies freely, if he experiences and proves to himself his liberty in
death and the liberty of his death, he will have attained the absolute. He will be that absolute. He
will be absolutely man, and there will be no absolute outside of him. In fact more is involved
here than a proof. In this obscure combat not only Kirilov's knowledge concerning the existence
of God, but that existence itself is at stake. God is gambling his own existence in this freely
chosen death which a resolute man takes upon himself. If someone becomes his own master even
in death, master of himself through death, he will be master also of that omnipotence which
makes itself felt by us through death, and he will reduce it to a dead omnipotence. Kirilov's
suicide thus becomes the death of God. Hence his strange conviction that this suicide will
inaugurate a new era, that it will mark the turning point in the history of humanity, and that,
precisely, after him men will no longer need to kill themselves. His death, by making death
possible, will have liberated life and rendered it wholly human.

Kirilov's words have an unsteady but attractive rhythm. He constantly loses his bearings among
clear arguments which he does not pursue to the end because of the intervention, the call of an
obscure argument which he cannot grasp but never ceases to hear. To all appearances his plan is
that of a calm and collected rationalist. If men do not kill themselves, he thinks, it is because they
are afraid of death; fear of death is the origin of God; if I can die in opposition to this fear, I will
have liberated death from fear and overthrown God. This is a plan which, requiring the serenity
of a man who keeps to reason's undeviating paths, conflicts with the lamp burning before the
icon, with the religious torment to which Kirilov confesses, and above all with the terror that
makes him falter at the end. Yet the starts and stops of this disoriented thinking, this madness
which we feel envelops it and even its dizzy fear -- beneath the mask it wears, which is shame at
being afraid -- are solely responsible for the fascinating interest of Kirilov's undertaking.
Speaking of death, he speaks of God, as if he needed this supreme name to understand and
evaluate such an event, to confront it in its supremacy. God is, for him, the face of his death. But
is it God that is at issue? Is not the omnipotence in whose shadow Kirilov wanders (sometimes
seized by a happiness which shatters time, sometimes delivered to horror against which he
defends himself with puerile ideologies) -- is not this power fundamentally anonymous? Does it
not make of him a nameless, powerless being, essentially cowardly and surrendered to
dispersion? This power is death itself, and what is at issue behind Kirilov's undertaking is death's
possibility. Can I kill myself? Have I the power to die? How far can I go freely into death, in full 
control of my freedom? Even when, with an ideal and heroic resolve, I decide to meet death, isn't
it still death that comes to meet me, and when I think I grasp it, does it not grasp me? Does it not
loosen all hold upon me, deliver me to the ungraspable? Do I die, humanly, a death which will be
that of a man and which I will imbue with all of human intention and freedom? Do I myself die,
or do I not rather die always other from myself, so that I would have to say that properly
speaking I do not die? Can I die? Have I the power to die?
The critical problem that torments Kirilov in the form of a God he would like to believe in is the
problem of his suicide's possibility. When someone says to him, "But many people kill
themselves," he does not even understand. As far as he is concerned, no one has yet killed
himself: no one has ever died by his own hand in a real coming to grips, a full and heartfelt
grasping of the situation which would make this act

an authentic action. Or again, no one has seen in death the possibility of taking it himself instead
of receiving it, dying "for the idea" as Kirilov puts it, dying that is, in a purely ideal manner.
Certainly, if he succeeds in making death a possibility which is his and fully human, he will have
attained absolute freedom. He will have attained it as a man, and he will have given it to men.
Or, in other words, he will have been conscious of disappearing and not consciousness
disappearing; he will have entirely annexed to his consciousness its own disappearance; he will
be, thus, a realized totality, the realization of the whole, the absolute. Certainly this privilege is
far superior to that of being immortal. Immortality, if it is mine to enjoy by definition, is not
mine. It is rather my limit and my constraint. Thus in this context my whole vocation as a man
consists in making of this immortality which is imposed upon me something I can gain or lose:
hell or heaven. But immortality in itself, over which I have no power, is nothing to me. On the
other hand, immortality might become one of science's conquests. Then it would have the value -
- beneficial or not -- of a cure for sickness. It would not be altogether without consequences, but
it would have none for Kirilov, who would still ask himself -- and with a passion made greater
by the greater strangeness of the problem: Do I retain the power to die? Immortality, guaranteed
by science, would have no weight in his destiny unless it signified the impossibility of death. But
then it would be, precisely, the symbolic representation of the question he embodies. For a
human race weirdly destined to be immortal, suicide would constitute perhaps the only chance to
remain human, the only way out toward a human future.
What might be called Kirilov's task -- death, when death becomes the search for its possibility --
is not exactly the task of voluntary death, the exercise of the will in a struggle with death. Is
suicide always the act of a man whose thought is already obscured, whose will is sick? Is it
always an involuntary act? That is what is said by certain psychiatrists who, in any event, do not
know it to be the case; some well-meaning theologians think so, in order to cover up the scandal,
and Dostoyevsky, who gives his character the appearance of madness, also draws back from the
abyss that has been opened up before him by Kirilov. But this is not the important problem: does
Kirilov truly die? Does he prove through his death the possibility which he received in advance
from his death, that power of not being which permitted him to be himself -- to be, that is, though
freely linked to himself, always other than himself -- the power to act, speak, take risks, and be
without being? Can he maintain even in death this sense of death, sustain even in death this

active and industrious death which is the power to finish, the power that has its source in the
end? Can he act in such a way that death will still be for him the force of the negative, the cutting
edge of decision, the moment of supreme possibility where even his own impossibility will come
to him in the form of a power? Or, on the contrary, is the experience one of radical reversal,
where he dies but cannot die, where death delivers him to the impossibility of dying?
In this search of his, it is not his own decisiveness that Kirilov is testing, but death as resolution.
He wants to know whether the purity, whether the integrity of his act can triumph over the
limitlessness of the indecisive, over the immense irresolution: over death. He wants to know
whether, by the force of his action, he can render death active and by the affirmation of his
freedom assert himself in death, appropriate it, make it true. In the world he is mortal, but in
death -- in this finish without definition -- does he not risk becoming infinitely mortal? The
question is his task. To answer it is his torment, which drags him toward death, toward the death
he wants to master through the exemplary value of his own, by making "death understood" its
only content.
Arria
To master death does not simply mean to remain one's own master in the face of death. That is
the indifferent sovereignty which Stoic serenity expresses. It is true that when, upon seeing her
husband, Caecina Poetus, hesitate, Arria plunges a dagger into her own breast, draws it back out,
and offers it to him saying, "It is not painful," her steadiness -- her stiffness -- is impressive.
Restraint is a feature of great and tranquil death scenes which gives pleasure. To die well means
to die with propriety, in conformity with oneself and with respect for the living. To die well is to
die in one's own life, turned toward one's life and away from death; and this good death shows
more consideration for the world than regard for the depth of the abyss. The living appreciate
this reserve, they prefer those who do not abandon themselves. The pleasure we take in a decent
end, our desire to make death humane and proper, to free it from its inhuman quality -- which,
before killing men degrades them through fear and transforms them into something repulsively
foreign -- can lead us to praise suicide for doing away with death. This is Nietzsche's position. In
his effort to eliminate the somber importance which Christianity attaches to the last hour, he
regards this final moment as totally insignificant and not even worth a thought: a

moment which is nothing to us and takes nothing from us. "There is nothing more banal than
death." "I am happy to see that men refuse absolutely to want to think about death!" Kirilov
would also like to say this to us. He himself thinks constantly about death, but in order to deliver
us from the thought of it. This is the outermost limit of the process of humanization; it is
Epicurus's external exhortation: if you are, death is not; if it is, you are not. Stoics want
indifference before death because they want it to be free of all passion. Thus they attribute
indifference to death; it is an indifferent moment. Ultimately, it is nothing, it is not even the last
moment, which still belongs to life. At this point they have completely vanquished the old enemy
and they can say, "O death, where is thy victory?" They can say this, providing they add, "Where
is thy sting?" For, having freed themselves from death, they have in the same stroke deprived
themselves of true life -- the life which "does not shun death or keep clear of destruction, but
endures its death and in death maintains its being." Hegel called it the life of Mind. 
It does not suffice, then, to approach the adversary with the strength of a combative mind that
wants to conquer, but from afar and in such a way, apparently, as to prevent death's approach. A
death that is free, useful, and conscious, that is agreeable to the living, in which the dying person
remains true to himself, is a death which has not met with death. It is a death in which there is
much talk of life, but in it is not heard the unheard language from which speech emerges like a
new gift. Those who do not abandon themselves elude thus the absolute abandon. We are spared
the worst, but the essential escapes us.
That is why, with his sense of what is profound and also from the perspective of his theoretical
intentions which were to show that militant atheism was a mad dream, Dostoyevsky did not give
Kirilov an impassive destiny, the cold resolve which is the heritage of the ancients. This hero of
certain death is neither indifferent nor master of himself, nor is he certain, and he does not go to
his nullification as toward a pale nothing, purified and proportioned to fit him. The fact that his
end is an extraordinary fiasco; that, in killing himself, he also kills his companion and double,
with whom he had maintained a sullen silence; that he has for his last interlocutor and finally for
his sole adversary only the most sinister figure, in whose countenance he can look upon the
failure of his undertaking in all its truth -- these circumstances are not simply part of his share of
existence in the world, but emerge from the sordid intimacy of the abyss. We believe, as we die,
that we are engaged in a noble

combat with God, and finally it is Verkhovensky we meet, a much truer image of that base
power with which one has to compete in bestiality.
We enter thus the greatest contradictions. The deliberateness in suicide, its free and imposing
side, whereby we strive to remain ourselves, serves essentially to protect us from what is at stake
in this event. It would seem that through our effort to remain ourselves, we elude the essential; it
would seem that we interpose ourselves illegitimately between something unbearable and
ourselves, still seeking, in this familiar death that comes from us, not to meet anyone but
ourselves, our own resolution and our own certitude. Purposeless passion, unreasonable and
vain: this is, on the contrary, what we read upon Kleist's face, and it is this which seems to us
imposing -- this passion which seems to reflect the immense passivity of death, which escapes
the logic of decisions, which can perfectly well speak but remains secret, mysterious, and
indecipherable because it bears no relation to light. Thus in voluntary death it is still extreme
passivity that we perceive -- the fact that action here is only the mask of a fascinated
dispossession. For this point of view, Arria's impassivity is no longer the sign of the preservation
of her mastery, but the sign of an absence, of a hidden disappearance, the shadow of someone
impersonal and neutral. Kirilov's feverishness, his instability, his steps which lead nowhere, do
not signify life's agitation or a still vital force; they indicate, rather, that he belongs to a space
where no one can rest, and which is in that respect a nocturnal space: no one is welcomed there;
there nothing can abide. Nerval, it is said, wandered adrift in the streets before hanging himself.
But aimless wandering is already death; it is the mortal error he must finally interrupt by
immobilizing himself. Hence the hauntingly repetitive character of suicidal gestures. He who,
through clumsiness, has missed his own death, is like a ghost returning only to continue to fire
upon his own disappearance. He can only kill himself over and over. This repetition is as
frivolous as the eternal and as grave as the imaginary. 
Thus it is not certain that suicide is an answer to the call of possibility in death. Suicide doubtless
asks life a question -- Is life possible? But it is more essentially a questioning of itself: Is suicide
possible? The psychological contradiction encumbering such a project is simply the consequence
of this deeper contradiction. He who kills himself says, "I withdraw from the world, I will act no
longer." And yet this same person wants to make death an act; he wants to act supremely and
absolutely. This illogical optimism which shines through voluntary death -- this

confidence that one will always be able to triumph in the end by disposing sovereignly of
nothingness, by being the creator of one's own nothingness and by remaining able, in the very
midst of the fall, to lift oneself to one's full height -- this certitude affirms in the act of suicide the
very thing suicide claims to deny. That is why he who espouses negation cannot allow it to be
incarnated in a final decision which would be exempt from that negation. The anguish which
opens with such assurance upon nothingness is not essential; it has drawn back before the
essential; it does not yet seek anything other than to make of nothingness the road to salvation.
Whoever dwells with negation cannot use it. Whoever belongs to it can no longer, in this
belonging, take leave of himself, for he belongs to the neutrality of absence in which already he
is not himself anymore. This situation is, perhaps, despair -- not what Kierkegaard calls "sickness
unto death," but the sickness in which dying does not culminate in death, in which one no longer
keeps up hope for death, in which death is no longer to come, but is that which comes no longer.
The weakness of suicide lies in the fact that whoever commits it is still too strong. He is
demonstrating a strength suitable only for a citizen of the world. Whoever kills himself could,
then, go on living: whoever kills himself is linked to hope, the hope of finishing it all, and hope
reveals his desire to begin, to find the beginning again in the end, to inaugurate in that ending a
meaning which, however, he means to challenge by dying. Whoever despairs cannot hope to die
either voluntarily or naturally: he has no time, he has no present upon which to brace himself in
order to die. He who kills himself is the great affirmer of the present. I want to kill myself in an
"absolute" instant, the only one which will not pass and will not be surpassed. Death, if it arrived
at the time we choose, would be an apotheosis of the instant; the instant in it would be that very
flash of brilliance which mystics speak of. And surely because of this, suicide retains the power
of an exceptional affirmation. It remains an event which one cannot be content to call voluntary,
an event which one can look neither back upon nor forward to.
The Strange Project, or Double Death
One cannot "plan" to kill oneself. This apparent project sets out after something never attained,
toward a goal impossible to aim for. I cannot conceive of the end as an end in itself. But this
implies that death eludes the workday, the time which is nevertheless death made active

and capable. This is equivalent to thinking that death is somehow doubled: there is one death
which circulates in the language of possibility, of liberty, which has for its furthest horizon the
freedom to die and the capacity to take mortal risks; and there is its double, which is
ungraspable. It is what I cannot grasp, what is not linked to me by any relation of any sort. It is
that which never comes and toward which I do not direct myself. 
Thus one begins to understand what is strange and superficial, fascinating and deceptive about
suicide. To kill oneself is to mistake one death for the other; it is a sort of bizarre play on words.
I go to meet the death which is in the world, at my disposal, and I think that thereby I can reach
the other death, over which I have no power -- which has none over me either, for it has nothing
to do with me, and if I know nothing of it, it knows no more of me; it is the empty intimacy of
this ignorance. That is why suicide remains essentially a bet, something hazardous: not because I
leave myself a chance to survive, as sometimes happens, but because suicide is a leap. It is the
passage from the certainty of an act that has been planned, consciously decided upon, and
vigorously executed, to something which disorients every project, remains foreign to all
decisions -- the indecisive and uncertain, the crumbling of the inert and the obscurity of the
nontrue. By commiting suicide I want to kill myself at a determined moment. I link death to
now: yes, now, now. But nothing better indicates the illusion, the madness of this "I want," for
death is never present. There is in suicide a remarkable intention to abolish the future as the
mystery of death: one wants in a sense to kill oneself so that the future might hold no secrets, but
might become clear and readable, no longer the obscure reserve of indecipherable death. Suicide
in this respect does not welcome death; rather, it wishes to eliminate death as future, to relieve
death of that portion of the yetto-come which is, so to speak, its essence, and to make it
superficial, without substance and without danger. But this tactic is vain. The most minute
precautions, all the most carefully considered and precise arrangements have no power over this
essential indeterminacy -- the fact that death is never a relation to a determined moment any
more than it bears any determined relation to myself.
One cannot "plan" to kill oneself. One prepares to do so, one acts in view of the ultimate gesture
which still belongs to the normal category of things to do, but this gesture does not have death in
view, it does not look at death, it does not keep death before it. Hence the attention to minutiae
often symptomatic in those who are about to die -- the

love for details, the patient, maniacal concern for the most mediocre realities. Other people are
surprised at this, and they say, "When you really want to die, you don't think about so many little
things." But the explanation is that you don't want to die, you cannot make of death an object of
the will. You cannot want to die, and the will, arrested thus at the uncertain threshold of what it
cannot attain, redirects itself, with its calculating wisdom, toward everything it still can grasp in
the area around its limit. You think of so many things because you cannot think of something
else, and this is not for fear of looking into the face of too grave a reality; it is because there is
nothing to see. Whoever wants to die can only want the borders of death, the utilitarian death
which is in the world and which one reaches through the precision of a workman's tools.
Whoever wants to die does not die, he loses the will to die. He enters the nocturnal realm of
fascination wherein he dies in a passion bereft of will.
Art, Suicide
What a strange, contradictory undertaking is this effort to act where immeasurable passivity
reigns, this striving to maintain the rules, to impose measure, and to fix a goal in a movement
that escapes all aims and all resolution. This contest seems to make death superficial by making
it into an act like any other -- something to do; but it also gives the impression of transfiguring
action, as if to reduce death to the level of a project were a unique opportunity to elevate the 
project toward that which exceeds it. This is madness, but it is madness we could not be spared
without being excluded from the human condition (a humanity that could no longer kill itself
would lose its balance, would cease to be normal). Suicide is an absolute right, the only one
which is not the corollary of a duty, and yet it is a right which no real power reinforces. It would
seem to arch like a delicate and endless bridge which at the decisive moment is cut and becomes
as unreal as a dream, over which nevertheless it is necessary really to pass. Suicide is a right,
then, detached from power and duty, a madness required by reasonable integrity and which,
moreover, seems to succeed quite often. It is striking that all these traits can be applied equally
well to another experience, one that is apparently less dangerous but perhaps no less mad: the
artist's. Not that the artist makes death his work of art, but it can be said that he is linked to the
work in the same strange way in which the man who takes death for a goal is linked to death.

This is evident at first glance. Both the artist and the suicide plan something that eludes all plans,
and if they do have a path, they have no goal; they do not know what they are doing. Both exert a
resolute will, but both are linked to what they want to achieve by a demand that knows nothing
of their will. Both strive toward a point which they have to approach by means of skill, savoir
faire, effort, the certitudes which the world takes for granted, and yet this point has nothing to do
with such means; it is a stranger to the world, it remains foreign to all achievement and
constantly ruins all deliberate action. How is it possible to proceed with a firm step toward that
which will not allow itself to be charted? It seems that both the artist and the suicide succeed in
doing something only by deceiving themselves about what they do. The latter takes one death for
another, the former takes a book for the work. They devote themselves to this misunderstanding
as if blind, but their dim consciousness of it makes of their task a proud bet. For it is as if they
were embarking upon a kind of action which could only reach its term at infinity.
This comparison of art to suicide is shocking in a way. But there is nothing surprising about it if,
leaving aside appearances, one understands that each of these two movements is testing a
singular form of possibility. Both involve a power that wants to be power even in the region of
the ungraspable, where the domain of goals ends. In both cases an invisible but decisive leap
intervenes: not in the sense that through death we pass into the unknown and that after death we
are delivered to the unfathomable beyond. No, the act of dying itself constitutes this leap, the
empty depth of the beyond. It is the fact of dying that includes a radical reversal, through which
the death that was the extreme form of my power not only becomes what loosens my hold upon
myself by casting me out of my power to begin and even to finish, but also becomes that which
is without any relation to me, without power over me -- that which is stripped of all possibility --
the unreality of the indefinite. I cannot represent this reversal to myself, I cannot even conceive
of it as definitive. It is not the irreversible step beyond which there would be no return, for it is
that which is not accomplished, the interminable and the incessant.
Suicide is oriented toward this reversal as toward its end. The work seeks this reversal as its
origin. That is a first difference. Suicide, to a certain extent, denies the reversal, doesn't take
account of it, and is only "possible" in this refusal. Voluntary death is the refusal to see the other
death, the death one cannot grasp, which one never reaches. It is a kind

of sovereign negligence, an alliance made with visible death in order to exclude the invisible
one, a pact with the good, faithful death which I use constantly in the world, an effort to expand
its sphere, to make it still viable and true beyond itself, where it is no longer anything but the
other death. The expression "I kill myself" suggests the doubling which is not taken into account.
For "I" is a self in the plenitude of its action and resolution, capable of acting sovereignly upon
itself, always strong enough to reach itself with its blow. And yet the one who is thus struck is no
longer I, but another, so that when I kill myself, perhaps it is "I" who does the killing, but it is
not done to me. Nor is it my death -- the one I dealt -- that I have now to die, but rather the death
which I refused, which I neglected, and which is this very negligence -- perpetual flight and
inertia.
The work wants, so to speak, to install itself, to dwell in this negligence. A call from there
reaches it. That is where, in spite of itself, it is drawn, by something that puts it absolutely to the
test. It is attracted by an ordeal in which everything is risked, by an essential risk where being is
at stake, where nothingness slips away, where, that is, the right, the power to die is gambled.

The Igitur Experience
From this point of view one can sense how it was that in Mallarmé concern for the work became
confused for a time with the affirmation of suicide. But one also sees how this same concern led
Rilke to seek a relationship with death that would be more "exact" than that of voluntary death.
These two experiences merit reflection.
Mallarmé acknowledged, in a letter to Cazalis ( November 14, 1896), that Igitur is an
undertaking in which poetry itself is at stake. "It is a tale with which I want to conquer the old
monster Impotence, which is, moreover, its subject, in order to cloister myself in a great labor
already planned and replanned. If it gets finished (the tale), I shall be cured." The great labor was
Hörodiade,
3
and also poetic work in the largest sense. Igitur is an attempt to make the work
possible by grasping it at the point where what is present is the absence of all power, impotence.
Mallarmé feels deeply here that the state of aridity which he knows so well is linked to the
work's demand, and is neither simply deprivation of the work nor a psychological state peculiar
to him.
"Unfortunately, by digging this thoroughly into verse, I have encountered two abysses which
make me despair. One is Nothingness . . . . The other void which I have found is the one in my
breast." "And now, having reached the horrible vision of a pure work, I have almost lost my
reason and the meaning of the most familiar words." "Everything which, as a result, my being
has suffered during this long agony is indescribable, but fortunately I am perfectly dead. . . .
Which is to convey to you that I am now impersonal, and no longer Stéphane whom you know."
When one recalls these remarks, one cannot doubt that Igitur was born of the obscure, essentially
hazardous experience into which the

3Mallarmé may, however, have had another text in mind.

craft of poetry, over the course of years, drew Mallarmé. This risk affects his normal relationship
to the world, his habitual use of language; it destroys all ideal certainties, deprives the poet of the
physical assurance of living. It exposes him finally to death -- the death of truth, the death of his
person; it yields him up to the impersonality of death.
The Exploration and Purification of Absence
Igitur's interest does not come directly from the thought which serves as its theme, which is such
that thinking would smother it, and which is similar in this respect to Hölderlin's. Holderlin's is,
however, richer, more active. He was familiar from youth with Hegel, whereas Mallarmé
received only an impression of Hegelian philosophy. And yet this impression corresponds to the
deep current which drew him, precisely, to the "frightful years." Everything is summed up for
Mallarmé by the relationship among the words thought, absence, language, and death. The
materialist profession of faith ("Yes, I know, we are but vain forms of matter"), is not Mallarmé's
point of departure. Such a revelation would have obliged him to reduce thought, God, and all the
other figures of the ideal to nothing. Quite obviously it is from this nothing that he starts. He felt
its secret vitality, its force and mystery in his contemplation and accomplishment of the poetic
task. His Hegelian vocabulary would merit no attention, were it not animated by an authentic
experience, and this experience is that of the power of the negative.
One can say that Mallarme saw this nothing in action; he experienced the activity of absence. In
absence he grasped a presence, a strength still persisting, as if in nothingness there were a strange
power of affirmation. All his remarks on language tend to acknowledge the word's ability to
make things absent, to evoke them in this absence, and then to remain faithful to this value of
absence, realizing it completely in a supreme and silent disappearance. In fact, the problem for
Mallarmé is not to escape from the real in which he feels trapped, according to a still generally
accepted interpretation of the sonnet on the swan. The true search and the drama take place in the
other sphere, the one in which pure absence affirms itself and where, in so doing, it eludes itself,
causing itself still to be present. It subsists as the dissimulated presence of being, and in this
dissimulation it persists as chance which cannot be abolished. And yet this is where everything is
at

stake, for the work is possible only if absence is pure and perfect, only if, in the presence of
Midnight, the dice can be thrown. There alone the work's origin speaks; there it begins, it finds
there the force of the beginning.
More precisely: the greatest difficulty does not come from the pressure of beings, from what we
call their reality, their persistent affirmation, whose action can never be altogether suspended. It
is in unreality itself that the poet encounters the resistance of a muffled presence. It is unreality
from which he cannot free himself; it is in unreality that, disengaged from beings, he meets with
the mystery of "those very words: it is." And this is not because in the unreal something subsists
-- not because the rejection of real things was insufficient and the work of negation brought to a
halt too soon -- but because when there is nothing, it is this nothing itself which can no longer be
negated. It affirms, keeps on affirming, and it states nothingness as being, the inertia of being.
This is the situation which would form the subject of Igitur, were it not necessary to add that the
narrative avoids this situation, seeking to surmount it by putting a term to it. These are pages in 
which some readers have thought they recognized the somber hues of despair. But actually they
carry a youthful expression of great hope. For if Igitur were to be right -- if death is true, if it is a
genuine act, not a random occurrence but the supreme possibility, the extreme moment in which
negation is founded and completed -- then the negation that operates in words, and "this drop of
nothingness" which is the presence of consciousness in us, the death from which we derive the
power not to be which is our essence, also partake of truth. They bear witness to something
definitive; they function to "set a limit upon the infinite." And so the work which is linked to the
purity of negation can in its turn arise in the certainty of that distant Orient which is its origin.
The Three Movements toward Death.
Igitur is thus not only an exploration but a purification of absence -- it is an attempt to make
absence possible and to glean possibility from it. The whole interest of this narrative lies in the
way three movements are accomplished together. To a certain extent they are distinct from each
other, and yet they are so closely linked that their interdependence remains hidden. All three
movements are necessary to reach death; but which controls the others, which is the most
important? The act by which the hero leaves the chamber, descends the staircase

drinks the poison, and enters the tomb apparently constitutes the initial decision, the "deed"
which alone gives reality to absence and authenticates nothingness. But in fact this is not the
case. This accomplishment is only an insignificant moment. What is done must first be dreamed,
thought, grasped in advance by the mind, not in a moment of psychological contemplation, but
through an actual movement -- a lucid effort on the part of the mind to advance outside of itself,
to see itself disappear and to appear to itself in the mirage of this disappearance, to gather itself
all up into this essential death which is the life of the consciousness and, out of all the various
acts of death through which we are, to form the unique act of the death to come which thought
reaches at the same time that it reaches, and thereby liquidates, itself.
Here voluntary death is no longer anything but a dying in spirit, which seems to restore to the act
of dying its pure, inward dignity -- but not according to the ideal of Jean-Paul Richter, whose
heroes, "lofty men," die in a pure desire to die, "their eyes gazing steadfastly beyond the clouds"
in response to the call of a dream which disembodies and dissolves them. The idea of suicide
found in Igitur is more akin to what Novalis means when he makes suicide "the principle of his
entire philosophy." "The truly philosophical act is suicide; the real beginning of all philosophy
lies in it; all the philosopher's desires tend toward it. Only this act fulfills all the conditions and
bears all the marks of a trans-worldly action." Yet these last words indicate a horizon unknown
to Igitur. Novalis, like most of the German Romantics, seeks in death a further region beyond
death, something more than death, a return to the transfigured whole -- in that night, for example,
which is not night but the peaceful oneness of day and night. Moreover, in Novalis the
movement toward death is a concentration of the will, an affirmation of its magical force, an
energetic expenditure or yet again an unruly affection for the remote. But Igitur does not seek to
surpass itself or to discover, through this voluntary move, a new point of view on the other side
of life. It dies by the spirit -- through the spirit's very development, through its presence to itself,
to its own profound, beating heart, which is precisely absence, the intimacy of absence, night.
Midnight 
Night: here is where the true profundity of Igitur is to be felt, and it is here that we can find the
third movement, which, perhaps, commands the two others. If the narrative begins with the
episode called

"Midnight" -- with the evocation of that pure presence where nothing but the subsistence of
nothing subsists -- this is certainly not in order to offer us a choice literary passage, nor is it, as
some have claimed, in order to set the scene for the action: the empty chamber and its lavish
furnishings enveloped, however, in shadows, the image of which is, in Mallarmé, something like
the original medium of poetry. This "décor" is in reality the center of the narration whose true
hero is Midnight and whose action is the ebb and flow of Midnight.
The story begins with the end, and that is what forms its troubling truth. With the very first
words, the chamber is empty, as if everything were already accomplished, the poison drunk, the
vial emptied, and the "lamentable personage" laid out upon his own ashes. Midnight is here; the
hour when the cast dice have absolved all movement is here; night has been restored to itself,
absence is complete, and silence pure. Thus everything has come to an end. Everything the end
must make manifest, all that Igitur seeks to create by means of his death -- the solitude of
darkness, the deep of disappearance -- is given in advance, and seems the condition for this
death: its anticipated appearance, its eternal image. A strange reversal. It is not the youth who, by
disappearing into death, institutes disappearance and therein establishes the night. It is the
absolute presence of this disappearance, its dark glistening, which alone permits him to die. It
alone introduces him to his mortal decision and act. It is as though death had first to be
anonymous in order to occur with certainty in someone's name, or as if, before being my death, a
personal act in which my person deliberately comes to an end, death had to be the neutrality and
impersonality in which nothing is accomplished, the empty omnipotence which consumes itself
eternally.
We are now a long way away from that voluntary death which the final episode let us see.
Drawing back from the precise action which consists in emptying the vial, we have returned to a
thought, the ideal act, already impersonal, where thinking and dying explored each other in their
reciprocal truth and their hidden identity. But now we find ourselves before the immense
passivity which, in advance, dissolves all action, even the action by which Igitur wants to die, the
momentary master of chance. It seems that three figures of death confront each other here in a
motionless simultaneity. All three are necessary for death's accomplishment, and the most secret
is apparently the substance of absence, the deep of the void created when one dies, the eternal
outside -- a space formed by my death and yet whose approach is alone what makes me die.
From such a perspective the event could

never happen (death could never become an event): that is what is inscribed in this prerequisite
night. The situation could also be expressed as follows: in order for the hero to be able to leave
the chamber and for the final chapter, "Leaving the Chamber," to be written, it is necessary that
the chamber already be empty and that the word to be written have returned forever into silence.
And this is not a difficulty in logic. This contradiction expresses everything that makes both
death and the work difficult. One and the other are somehow unapproachable, as Mallarmé said 
in notes that seem, precisely, to concern Igitur: "The Drama is only insoluble because
unapproachable." And he comments further in the same passage: "The Drama is caused by the
Mystery of what follows -- Identity (Idea) Self -- of the Theater and the Hero through the Hymn.
Operation. -- the Hero disengages -- the (maternal) hymn which creates him, and he restores
himself to the Theater which it was -- of the Mystery where this hymn was hidden." If the
"Theater" here means Midnight's space, a moment which is a place, then theater and hero are
indeed identical, through the hymn which is death become word. How can Igitur "disengage" this
death my making it become song and hymn, and thereby restore himself to the theater, to the
pure subsistence of Midnight where death was hidden? That is the "operation." It is an end which
can only be a return to the beginning, as the last words of the narrative say: "Nothingness having
departed, there remains the Castle of purity," that empty chamber in which everything persists.
The "Act of Night"
The way Mallarmé nevertheless tries to approach the drama, in order to find a solution to it, is
very revealing. Among night, the hero's thoughts, and his real acts, or, in other words, among
absence, the thought of this absence, and the act by which it is realized, an exchange is
established, a reciprocity of movements. First we see that this Midnight, eternal beginning and
eternal end, is not so immobile as one might think. "Certainly a presence of Midnight subsists."
But this subsisting presence is not a presence. This substantial present is the negation of the
present. It is a vanished present. And Midnight, where first "the absolute present of things" (their
unreal essence) gathered itself together, becomes "the pure dream of a Midnight vanished into
itself": it is no longer a present, but the past, symbolized, as is the end of history in Hegel, by a
book lying open upon the table, "page and usual décor of Night." Night is the book: the silence
and inaction of a

book when, after everything has been proffered, everything returns into the silence that alone
speaks -- that speaks from the depth of the past and is at the same time the whole future of the
word. For present Midnight, that hour at which the present lacks absolutely, is also the hour in
which the past touches and, without the intervention of any timely act whatever, immediately
attains the future at its most extreme. And such, we have seen, is the very instant of death, which
is never present, which is the celebration of the absolute future, the instant at which one might
say that, in a time without present, what has been will be. This is announced to us in two famous
sentences of Igitur. "I was the hour which is to make me pure"; and, more exactly, in Midnight's
farewell to night -- a farewell which can never end because it never takes place now, because it is
present only in night's eternal absence: "Adieu, night, that I was, your own tomb, but which,
surviving shade, will change into Eternity." 4
However, this structure of Night has already given us back a movement: its immobility is
constituted by this call of the past to the future, the muffled scansion by which what has been
affirms its identity with what will be beyond the wrecked and sunken present, the abyss of the
present. With this "double beat," the night stirs, it acts, it becomes an act, and this act opens the
gleaming doors of the tomb, creating the solution which makes the "exit from the chamber"
possible. 5 Here Mallarmé discovers the motionless sliding which causes things to move forward
at the heart of their eternal annulment. There is an imperceptible exchange among the inner
oscillation of the night, the pulse of the clock, the back and forth of the doors of the open tomb, 
the back and forth of consciousness which returns to and goes out from itself, which divides and
escapes from itself, wandering distantly from itself with a rustling of nocturnal wings, a phantom
already confused with the ghosts of those who have already died. This "rhythm," in all these
forms, is the movement of a disappearance, the movement of return to the heart of disappearance
-- a "faltering beat," however, which bit by bit affirms itself, takes on body, and finally becomes
the living heart of Igitur, that heart whose too lucid certainty then "troubles" him and summons
him to the real act of death. Thus we have come from the most interior to the most exterior.
Indefinite absence, immutable and sterile, has imperceptibly transformed itself. It has taken on
the look

4
In his essay on Mallarmé ( The Interior Distance), Georges Poulet is right to say that this hour
can "never be expressed by a present, always by a past or a future."
5
"The hour formulates itself in this echo, at the threshold of the open doors by its act of night."

and the form of this youth, and having become real in him, it finds in this reality the means of
realizing the decision that annihilates him. Thus night, which is Igitur's intimacy, the pulsating
death which is the heart of each of us, must become life itself, the sure heart of life, so that death
may ensue, so that death may for an instant let itself be grasped, identified--in order that death
might become the death of an identity which has decided it and willed it.
The earlier versions of Mallarmé's narrative show that in the death and the suicide of Igitur he
initially saw the death and the purification of night. In these pages (in particular in scholium d), it
is no longer either Igitur or his consciousness that acts and keeps watch, but night itself, and all
the events are lived by the night. The heart which, in the definitive text, Igitur recognizes as his
own--"I hear the pulsating of my own heart. I do not like this noise: this perfection of my
certitude troubles me; everything is too clear" -- this heart, then, is, in the earlier versions, the
night's heart: "Everything was perfect; night was pure Night, and it heard its own heart beat. Still,
this heart troubled it, gave it the disquietude of too much certainty, of a proof too self-confident.
Night wanted in its turn to plunge back into the darkness of its unique tomb and to abjure the
idea of its form." The night is Igitur, and Igitur is that portion of night which the night must
"reduce to the state of darkness" in order to become again the liberty of night.
The Igitur Catastrophe
It is significant that, in the most recent version, Mallarmé modified the whole perspective of the
work by making it Igitur's monologue. Although in this prolongation of Hamlet's soliloquy there
is no very ringing affirmation of the first person, that wan "I" which from moment to moment
presents itself behind the text and supports its diction is clearly perceptible. In this way,
everything changes. On account of this voice which speaks, it is no longer night that speaks, but
a voice that is still very personal, no matter how transparent it makes itself; and where we
thought we were in the presence of the secret of Midnight, the pure destiny of absence, we now
have only the speaking presence, the rarefied but certain evidence of a consciousness which, in
the night which has become its mirror, still contemplates only itself. That is remarkable. It is as
though Mallarmé had drawn back before what he will call, in Un Coup de dés, "the identical
neutrality of the abyss." He seemed to do justice to the night, but it is to consciousness

that he delegates all rights. Yes it is as though he had feared to see everything dissipate, "waver,
subside, madness," if he did not introduce, surreptitiously, a living mind which, from behind,
could still sustain the absolute nullity that he claimed to evoke. Whoever wishes to speak of a
"catastrophe" in Igitur might well find it here. Igitur does not leave the chamber: the empty
chamber is simply he -- he who merely goes on speaking of the empty chamber and who, to
make it absent, has only his word, founded by no more original absence. And if, in order to
accede sovereignly to death, it is truly necessary that he expose himself to the presence of
sovereign death -- that pure medium of a Midnight which "crosses him out" and obliterates him -
- this confrontation, this decisive test is missed, for it takes place under the protection of
consciousness, with its guarantee, and without consciousness's running any risk.
Finally there remains only the act in the obscurity of its resolve: the vial that is emptied, the drop
of nothingness that is drunk. Granted, this act is imbued with consciousness, but its having been
decided upon does not suffice to make it decisive; it bears in itself the cloudiness of the decision.
Igitur ends his monologue rather feebly with these words, "The hour has struck for me to depart,"
in which we see that everything remains to be done. He has not taken so much as one step toward
the "therefore" which his name represents -- that conclusion of himself which he wants to draw
from himself, believing that solely by virtue of understanding it, knowing it in its quality as
chance, he can rise to the level of necessity and annul his end as chance by adjusting himself
precisely to that nullity. But how could Igitur know chance? Chance is the night he has avoided,
in which he has contemplated only proof of himself and his constant certitude. Chance is death,
and the dice according to which one dies are cast by chance; they signify only the utterly
hazardous movement which reintroduces us within chance. Is it at Midnight that "the dice must
be cast"? But Midnight is precisely the hour that does not strike until after the dice are thrown,
the hour which has never yet come, which never comes, the pure, ungraspable future, the hour
eternally past. Nietzsche had already come up against the same contradiction when he said, "Die
at the right time." That right moment which alone will balance our life by placing opposite it on
the scales a sovereignly balanced death can be grasped only as the unknowable secret: only as
that which could never be elucidated unless, already dead, we could look at ourselves from a
point from which it would be granted us to embrace as a whole both our life and our death -- the
point which is perhaps the truth of the night from which Igitur would like, precisely, to take his
leave, in order to render his

leave-taking possible and correct, but which he reduces to the poverty of a reflection. "Die at the
right time." But death's rightful quality is impropriety, inaccuracy -- the fact that it comes either
too soon or too late, prematurely and as if after the fact, never coming until after its arrival. It is
the abyss of present time, the reign of a time without a present, without that exactly positioned
point which is the unstable balance of the instant whereby everything finds its level upon a single
plane.
Un Coup de dés
Is Un Coup de dés the recognition of such a failure? Is it the renunciation of the wish -- to master
the measurelessness of chance through a sovereignly measured death? Perhaps. But this cannot
be said with certainty. Rather, it is Igitur, a work not simply unfinished but left dangling, that
announces this failure -- announces it by being thus forsaken. And thereby it recovers its 
meaning. It escapes the naïveté of a successful undertaking to become the force and the
obsession of the interminable. For thirty years Igitur accompanied Mallarmé, just as all his life
the hope of the "great Work" kept its vigil by his side. He evoked this Work mysteriously before
his friends, and he eventually made its realization credible even in his own eyes and even, for a
time, in the eyes of the man who had the least confidence in the impossible, Valéry -- Valéry
who, startled by his own credence, never recovered from this hurt, so to speak, but hid it beneath
the demands of a contrary commitment.
Un Coup de dés is not Igitur, although it resurrects almost all of Igitur's elements. It is not Igitur
reversed, the challenge abandoned, the dream defeated, hope changed to resignation. Such
comparisons would be worthless. Un Coup de dés does not answer Igitur as one sentence
answers another, as a solution answers a problem. That reverberating proclamation itself -- A
THROW OF THE DICE NEVER WILL ABOLISH CHANCE -- the force of its affirmation, the
peremptory brilliance of its certitude, which makes it an authoritative presence holding the whole
work together physically -- this lightning which seems to fall upon the mad faith of Igitur in
order to destroy and consume it, does not contradict Igitur, but on the contrary gives it its last
chance, which is not to annul chance, even by an act of mortal negation, but to abandon itself
entirely to chance, to consecrate chance by entering without reserve into its intimacy, with the
abandon of impotence, "without the ship that is vain no matter where." In an artist so fascinated
by the desire for mastery, nothing is more impressive than that final phase in

which the work shines suddenly above him, no longer necessary but as a "perhaps" of pure
chance, in the uncertainty of "the exception," not necessary but the absolutely unnecessary, a
constellation of doubt which only shines in the forgotten sky of perdition. The night of Igitur has
become the sea, "the gaping deep," "the identical neutrality of the abyss," "a whirlpool of hilarity
and horror." But Igitur was still searching only for himself in the night, and he wanted to die in
the heart of his thought. To make impotence a power -- these were the stakes; this has been
conveyed to us. In Un Coup de dés, the youth, who has matured, however, who is now "the
Master," the man of sovereign mastery, does perhaps hold the successful throw of the dice in his
hand, "the unique Number which does not want to be another"; but he does not take his unique
chance to master chance any more than a man who always holds in his hand the supreme power,
the power to die, can exercise that power. He dies outside this power, "cadaver pulled away by
the arm from the secret he holds." This massive image rejects the challenge of voluntary death,
where the hand holds the secret by which we are cast out of the secret. And this chance which is
not taken, which remains idle, is not even a sign of wisdom, the fruit of a carefully considered
and resolute abstention. It is itself something random, linked to the happenstance of old age and
its incapacities, as if impotence had to appear to us in its most devastated form, where it is
nothing but misery and abandon, the ludicrous future of an extremely old man whose death is
only useless inertia. "A shipwreck that." But what happens in this shipwreck? Can the supreme
conjunction, the game which in the fact of dying is played not against or with chance, but in its
intimacy, in that region where nothing can be grasped -- can this relation to impossibility still
prolong itself? Can it give rise to an "as if" with which the dizziness of the work would be
suggested -- a delirium contained by "a small rigorous reason," a sort of "worried" "laughter,"
"mute" and "expiatory"? To this no answer is offered, no other certainty than the concentration of 
chance, its stellar glorification, its elevation to the point where its rupture "rains down absence,"
"some last point which sanctifies it."
"If it gets finished (the tale), I shall be cured." This hope is touching in its simplicity. But the tale
was not finished. Impotence -- that abandon in which the work holds us and where it requires
that we descend in the concern for its approach -- knows no cure. That death is incurable. The
absence that Mallarmé hoped to render pure is not pure. The night

is not perfect, it does not welcome, it does not open. It is not the opposite of day -- silence,
repose, the cessation of tasks. In the night, silence is speech, and there is no repose, for there is
no position. There the incessant and the uninterrupted reign -- not the certainty of death
achieved, but "the eternal torments of Dying."

Rilke and Death's Demand
When Rilke, in order to live up to his poet's destiny, does his best to accommodate that greater
dimension of himself which must not exclude what he becomes by dying, he cannot be said to
recoil from the difficult sides of the experience. He faces what he calls the horror. It is most
terrible. It is too great a force for us: it is our own force which outdoes us [nous dépasse] and
which we do not recognize. But, for that reason, we must draw it toward us, bring it close, and in
it bring ourselves close to what is close to it.
Sometimes he speaks of overcoming death. The word overcome is one of the words poetry
needs. To overcome means to outdo [dépasser], but to outdo what outdoes us by undergoing it,
without turning away from it or aiming at anything beyond. Perhaps it is in this sense that
Nietzsche intends Zarathustra's formula: "Man is something that must be overcome." It is not
that man must attain something beyond man; he has nothing to attain, and if he is what exceeds
him, this excess is not anything he can possess, or be. To overcome, then, is also very different
from to master. One of the errors of voluntary death lies in the desire to be master of one's end
and to impose one's form and limit even upon this last movement. Such is the challenge of Igitur:
to assign a limit to chance, to die centered within oneself in the transparency of an event which
one has made equal to oneself, which one has annihilated and by which, thus, one can be
annihilated without violence. Suicide remains linked to this wish to die by doing without death
[en se passant de la mort].
When Rilke contemplates the suicide of the young Count Wolf Kalckreuth -- and his
contemplation takes the form of a poem -- what he cannot accept is the impatience and the
inattention which this form of death shows. Inattention is an offense against a certain profound
maturity which

is the opposite of the modern world's brutal agitation -- that officiousness which hurries to action
and bustles about in the empty urgency of things to do. Impatience is also an offense against
suffering: by refusing to suffer the frightful, by eluding the unbearable, one eludes the moment 
when everything reverses and the greatest danger becomes the essential security. The impatience
in voluntary death is this refusal to wait to reach the pure center where we would find our
bearings again in that which exceeds us.
Why did you not wait until the burden became unbearable: then it reverses itself and is only so
heavy because it is so pure. 6
Thus we see that too prompt a death is like a child's caprice, a failure in attentiveness, a gesture
of inattention which leaves us strangers to our end -- leaves us to die, despite the resolute
character of the event, in a state of distraction and impropriety. He who too willingly dies -- that
too passionately mortal being, man, who with all his might wants to cease living -- is as if
whisked from death by the violence of the élan that tears him from life. One must not desire to
die too much; one must not obfuscate death by casting the shadow of an excessive desire upon it.
Perhaps there are two distracted deaths: the one in which we have not matured, which does not
belong to us, and the one which has not matured in us and which we have acquired by violence.
In both cases -- on the one hand because death is not our own, and on the other because it is more
our desire than our death -- we might well fear perishing for lack of death by succumbing in the
ultimate state of inattention.
1. The Search for a Proper Death
It seems, then, that outside all religious or moral systems, one is led to wonder whether there are
not a good and a bad death: a possibility of dying authentically, on good terms with death, and
also a danger of dying badly, as if inadvertently, an inessential and false death -- a danger so
great that all of life could depend upon this legitimate relation to death, this clear-sighted gaze
directed toward the profundity of an exact

[In translating Blanchot's quotations from Rilke's poems, I have consulted J. B. Leishman's
English verse translations of the original texts, Selected Works ( New York: New Directions,
1967), vol. 1; but my English seeks to be as close as possible to Blanchot's French version of
Rilke -- Trans.]

death. When one reflects upon this concern that death be valid, and this need to link the word
death with the word authenticity--a need which Rilke lived intensely in several forms--one sees
that for him it had a double origin.
A. To Die Faithful to Onself
O Lord, grant to each his own death, the dying which truly evolves from this life in which he
found love, meaning and distress.
This wish is rooted in a form of individualism which belongs to the end of the nineteenth century
and which was endowed with its noble pride by a narrowly interpreted Nietzsche. Nietzsche too
wishes to die his own death. Hence the excellence which sees in voluntary death. "He dies his
death, victorious, who accomplishes it himself." "But detestable . . . is your grimacing death,
which advances in its belly like a thief." "If not, your death will suit you ill." To die an individual
death, still oneself at the very last, to be an individual right up to the end, unique and undivided:
this is the hard, central kernel which does not want to let itself be broken. One wants to die, but 
in one's own time and one's own way. One doesn't want to die just anybody's undistinguished
death. Contempt for anonymous death, for the "They die," is the disguised anguish to which the
anonymous character of death gives rise. Or again, one is glad to die: it is noble to die, but not to
decease.
The Anguish of Anonymous Death
Contempt plays no part in Rilke's discreet and silent intimacy. But the anguish of anonymous
death confirmed him in the concern which the views of Simmel, Jacobsen, and Kierkegaard had
first awakened in him. Malte gave this anguish a form which we would not able to separate from
that book if our era not, at closer range, contemplated impersonal death and the particular look it
gives men. In fact, Malte's anguish has more than a little to do with the anonymous existence of
big cities--to that distress which makes vagrants of some, men fallen out of themselves and out
of the world, already dead of an unwitting death never to be achieved. Such is the true
perspective of this book: the apprenticeship of exile, proximity to error which takes the concrete
form of the vagabond existence into which the young

foreigner slips, banished from his station in life, cast into the insecurity of a space where he
cannot live or die "himself."
This fear which arises in Malte, which leads him to discover "the existence of the terrible" in
every particle of air -- this anguish born of oppressive strangeness, when all protective security is
gone and suddenly the idea of a human nature, of a human world in which we could take shelter
collapses: Rilke confronted it lucidly and endured it bravely. He stayed in Paris, in that town too
big and "full to the brim with sadness," stayed there "precisely because it is difficult." He saw
there the decisive test, the one which transforms and teaches to see, a starting point for "a
beginner learning the conditions of his own life." "If one manages to work here, one advances far
in profundity." Nevertheless, when he tries to give form to this test in the third part of the Book
of Hours, why does he seem to turn away from death as he saw it, the frightful approach of an
empty mask, and replace it with the hope for another death, which would be neither foreign nor
heavy? Doesn't this faith which he expresses -- this thought that one can die greeted by a death of
one's own, familiar and amicable -- mark the point at which he eluded the experience by
enveloping himself in a hope meant to console his heart? One can't fail to recognize this backing
off. But there is something else as well. Malte does not encounter anguish only in its pure form
of the terrible; he also discovers the terrible in the form of the absence of anguish, daily
insignificance. Nietzsche had seen this too, but he accepted it as a challenge: "There is nothing
more banal than death." Death as banality, death degrading itself and becoming a vulgar nullity:
that is what made Rilke back away. He shrank from the moment when death reveals itself as it
also is, when dying and killing have no more importance than "taking a drink of water of cutting
the head of a cabbage." Mass-produced death, ready-made in bulk for all and in which each
disappears hastily; death as an anonymous product, an object without value, like the things of the
modern world which Rilke always rejected: if only from these comparisons one sees how he
slips from death's essential neutrality to the idea that this neutrality is but an historical and
temporary form of death, the sterile death of big cities. 7
Sometimes, when fear seizes him, he
cannot avoid hearing the anonymous hum of "dying" which is by no means the fault of the times
or 

7
"It is evident that with accelerated production, each individual death is not so well executed,
but that doesn't matter much anyway. It's the quantity that counts. Who still attaches any
importance to a well-wrought death? No one. Even rich people, who can pay for luxury, have
ceased to care about it; the desire to have one's own death

people's negligence. In all times we all die like the flies that autumn forces indoors, into rooms
where they circle blindly in an immobile dizziness, suddenly dotting the walls with their
mindless death. But, the fear past, Rilke reassures himself by evoking the happier world of
another time, and that nil death which made him shudder seems to him to reveal only the
indigence of an era devoted to haste and idle amusement.
When I think back to my home (where there is nobody left now), it always seems to me that
formerly it must have been otherwise. Formerly one knew -- or maybe one guessed -- that one
had one's death within one, as the fruit its core. Children had a little one, adults a big one.
Women carried it in their womb, men in their breast. They truly had their death, and that
awareness gave dignity, a quiet pride.
And so the image of a loftier death arises in Rilke, that of the Chamberlain, where death's
sovereignty, at the same time that it exceeds our habitual human perspectives with its
monumental omnipotence, retains at least the features of an aristocratic superiority, which one
fears, but which one can admire.
The Task of Dying and the Artistic Task
In this terror before mass-produced death there is the sadness of the artist who honors wellwrought
things, who wants to make a work and make of death his work. Death is thus from the
start linked to the movement, so difficult to bring to light, of the artistic experience. This does
not mean that, like the much-admired personalities of the Renaissance, we are to be artists of
ourselves, to make of our life and of our death an art, and of art a sumptuous affirmation of our
person. Rilke enjoys neither the tranquil innocence of this pride nor its naïveté. He is sure neither
of himself nor of the work, since he lives in a critical period which obliges art to feel unjustified.
Art is perhaps a road toward ourselves -- Rilke is the first to think so -- and perhaps also toward a
death which would be ours. But where is art? The road that leads to it is

is becoming more and more rare. Shortly it will be as rare as a life of one's own" ( The
Notebooks of M.-L. Brigge). [In translating Blanchot's quotations from this book, I have been
guided by Herter Norton M. D. English translation of the original, The Notebooks of Malte
Laurids Brigge ( New York: Norton Press, 1949) -- Trans.]

unknown. Granted, the work demands effort, application, knowledge; but all these forms of
aptitude are plunged in an immense ignorance. The work always means: not knowing that art
exists already, not knowing that there is already a world.
The search for a death that would be mine sheds light, thanks to the obscurity of its paths, upon
precisely what is difficult in artistic "realization." When one considers the images that serve to 
sustain Rilke's thought (death "ripens" in our very heart; it is the "fruit," the sweet, obscure fruit,
or else a fruit still "green," without sweetness, which we, "leaves and bark," must bear and
nourish), 8
one sees clearly that he seeks to make of our end something other than an accident
which would arrive from outside to terminate us hastily. Death must exist for me not only at the
very last moment, but as soon as I begin to live and in life's intimacy and profundity. Death
would thus be part of existence, it would draw life from mine, deep within. It would be made of
me and, perhaps, for me, as a child is the child of its mother. These are images which Rilke also
uses frequently: we engender our death, or else we bring our death into the world dead, a
stillborn child. And he prays:
And grant us now (after all women's pains) the serious motherhood of men.
These are grave and troubling figures which, however, keep their secret. Rilke appeals to the
image of vegetable or organic maturation only in order to turn us toward what we prefer to stay
clear of -- in order to show us that death has a kind of existence, and to train our attention upon
this existence, awaken our concern. Death exists, but what form of existence does it have? What
relation does this image establish between him who lives and the fact of dying? One might
believe in a natural link; one might think, for example, that I produce my death as the body
produces cancer. But that is not the case: despite the biological reality of the event, one must
always reflect, beyond the organic phenomenon, upon death's being. One never dies simply of an

In there is Death. Not the one whose voice
Wonderfully greeted them in their childhood,
but the little death as it is understood in there,

is the fruit around which all revolves.

illness, but of one's death, and that is why Rilke shied so stubbornly from learning of what he
was dying: he did not want to put between himself and his end the mediation of any general
knowledge.
My intimacy with my death seems, then, unapproachable. It is not within me like the vigilance of
the species or like a vital necessity which over and above my person would affirm the larger
view of nature. All such naturalistic conceptions are foreign to Rilke. I remain responsible for
this intimacy which I cannot approach. I can, according to an obscure choice incumbent upon
me, die of the great death which I bear within me, but also of that little death, sour and green,
which I have been unable to make into a lovely fruit, or yet again of a borrowed, random death:
. . . it's not our death, but one that takes us in the end only because we have not ripened our own.
This foreign death makes us die in the distress of estrangement. 
My death must become always more inward. It must be like my invisible form, my gesture, the
silence of my most hidden secret. There is something I must do to accomplish it; indeed,
everything remains for me to do: it must be my work. But this work is beyond me, it is that part
of me upon which I shed no light, which I do not attain and of which I am not master. Sometimes
Rilke, in his respect for thoughtful effort and tasks carefully done, says of such a death:
. . . it was a death which good work
had profoundly formed, this proper death
which has so great a need of us because we live it,
and to which we are never nearer than here.
Death would seem, then, to be the dearth which we must generously fill, essential poverty which
resembles that of God, "the absolute want that wants our aid," and which is terrifying only
because of the distress that separates it from us. To sustain, to fashion our nothingness -- such is
the task. We must be the figurers and the poets of our death.
Patience
Such is the task: it invites us once more to associate poetic labors and the effort we must put into
dying, but it clarifies neither one nor the other. The impression of a singular activity, scarcely
graspable, essentially different from what is ordinarily called acting and doing, alone persists.
The image of the fruit's slow maturation, the invisible

growth of that other fruit, the child, suggest the idea of unhurried efforts, where relations with
time are profoundly changed, as are relations with our will which projects and produces.
Although the perspective is different, we find again here the same condemnation of impatience
which we have recognized in Kafka: the feeling that the shortest road is an offense against the
indefinite if it leads us toward what we want to reach without making us reach what exceeds all
will. 9
Time as it is expressed in our habitual activities is time that decides, that negates; it is the
hasty movement between points that must not retain it. Patience tells another time, another sort
of task whose end one doesn't see, which assigns us no goal we can steadfastly pursue. Here
patience is essential because impatience is inevitable in this space (the space of death's approach
and of the work's), where there are neither milestones nor forms, where one has to suffer the
unruly call of the remote. Impatience is inevitable and necessary. Were we not impatient, we
would have no right to patience; we would not know that great appeasement which in the
greatest tension no longer tends toward anything. Patience is the endurance of impatience, its
acceptance and welcome, the accord which wants still to persist in the most extreme confusion.
10
This patience, though it separates us from all forms of daily activity, is not inactive. But its
procedure is mysterious. The task of forming our death leaves us to guess: it seems that we are to
do something which, however, we cannot do, which does not depend upon us, but we upon it,
upon which we do not even depend, for it escapes us and we escape it. To say that Rilke affirms
the immanence of death in life is no doubt to speak correctly, but it is also to construe only one
side of his

10If one compared this patience to the dangerous mobility of Romantic thought, patience would 
appear as its intimacy, but also as the inner pause, the expiation at the very heart of the fault
(although in Rilke, patience often signifies a humbler attitude, a return to the silent tranquility
of things as opposed to the feverishness of tasks, or yet again, as obedience to the fall which,
drawing a thing toward the center of gravity of pure forces, makes it come to rest and rest
itself in its immobile plenitude).
9Van Gogh constantly appeals to patience: "What is it to draw? How does one come to do it? It
is the action of making one's way through an invisible iron wall which seems to be between
what one feels and what one is capable of. How is one to get through this wall, for it is no use
beating on it, one must undermine it and file one's way through slowly and patiently in my
judgment."
"I am not an artist -- how imprecise -- even to think this of oneself -- how could one not have
patience, not learn from nature to have patience, have patience by seeing the wheat silently
rise, things grow -- how could one judge oneself to be a thing so absolutely dead as to think
that one can no longer even grow. . . . I say this to show how stupid I find it to speak of artists'
being gifted or not."

thought. This immanence is not given; it is to be achieved. It is our task, and such a task consists
not only in humanizing or in mastering the foreignness of our death by a patient act, but in
respecting its "transcendence." We must understand in it the absolutely foreign, obey what
exceeds us, and be faithful to what excludes us. What must one do to die without betraying this
high power, death? There is, then, a double task: I must die a death which does not betray me,
and I myself must die without betraying the truth and the essence of death.
B. To Die Faithful to Death
It is at this juncture that we come back to the other requirement at the origin of Rilke's image of
personal death. The anguish of anonymous death, the anguish of the "They die" and the hope for
an "I die" in which individualism retrenches, tempts him at first to want to give his name and his
countenance to the instant of dying: he does not want to die like a fly in the hum of mindlessness
and nullity; he wants to possess his death and be named, be hailed by this unique death. From
this perspective he suffers the obsession of the "I" that wants to die without ceasing to be "I" -- a
remainder of the need for immortality. This "I" wants to die concentrated in the very fact of
dying, so that my death might be the moment of my greatest authenticity, the moment toward
which "I" propel myself as if toward the possibility which is absolutely proper to me, which is
proper only to me and which secures me in the steadfast solitude of this pure "I."
However, Rilke does not think only of the anguish of ceasing to be himself. He also thinks of
death, of the supreme experience it represents, an experience which, because it is supreme, is
terrifying, whose terror keeps us at a distance and which is impoverished by this distance. Men
have recoiled from the obscure part of themselves, they have rejected and excluded it, and thus it
has become foreign to them. It is an enemy to them, an evil power which they evade through
constant distractions or which they denature by the dread which separates them from it. This is a
great sorrow. It makes our life a desert of dread, doubly impoverished: impoverished by the
poverty of this dread which is a bad dread, impoverished because deprived of the death which
this poor dread thrusts obstinately outside us. And so, to make death my death is no longer at this
point to remain myself even in death; it is to 

stretch this self as far even as death, to expose myself to death, no longer excluding but including
it -- to regard it as mine, to read it as my secret truth, the terribleness in which I recognize what I
am when I am greater than myself, absolutely myself or the absolutely great.
And so the concern that will bit by bit displace the center of Rilke's thoughts is affirmed: will we
continue to regard death as the foreign and incomprehensible, or will we learn to draw it into life,
to make of it the other name, the other side of life? This concern becomes more pressing and
more painful with the war. The horror of war sheds its somber light upon all that is inhuman for
man in this abyss: yes, death is the adversary, the invisible opponent that wounds the best in us
and by which all our joys perish. This view weighs heavily with Rilke, whom the ordeal of 1914
ravages in every way. Hence the energy he clearly devotes to keeping his gaze level before the
ghastly sight of all the graves. In the Bardo Thödol, the Tibetan Book of the Dead, the deceased,
during a period of indecision when he continues to die, sees himself confronted with the clear
primordial light, then with the peaceful deities, then with the terrifying figures of the angry
deities. If he lacks the strength to recognize himself in these images, if he does not see in them
the projection of his own horrified soul, avid and violent -- if he seeks to flee them -- he will give
them reality and density and thus fall back into the errors of existence. It is to a similar
purification during life itself that Rilke calls us, with the difference that death is not the
denunciation of the illusory appearances in which we live, but forms a whole with life, forms the
generous space of the two domains' unity. Confidence in life and, for life's sake, in death: if we
refuse death it is as if we refused the somber and difficult sides of life. It is as if we sought to
welcome in life only its minimal parts. So, then, would our pleasures be minimal. "Whoever does
not consent to the frightful in life and does not greet it with cries of joy never enters into
possession of the inexpressible powers of our life. He remains marginal. When the time for
judgment comes, he will have been neither alive nor dead." 11

11In this effort to "strengthen a familiar trust in death by basing it upon the profoundest joys and
splendors of life," Rilke seeks, above all, to master our fear. What we dread as an enigma is
only unknown because of the error, our fear, which prevents it from making itself known. Our
horror creates the horrible. It is the force with which we exclude death that confronts us, when
death arrives, with the horror of being excluded from our own milieu. Rilke does not put
death on a pinnacle; he seeks first and foremost a reconciliation: he wants us to trust in this
obscurity that it might clarify itself. But, as

The Malte Experience
The Malte experience was decisive for Rilke. This book is mysterious because it turns around a
hidden center which the author was unable to approach. This center is the death of Malte, or the
instant of his collapse. The whole first part of the book announces it: all Malte's experiences tend
to undermine life with the proof of its impossibility; a bottomless space opens where he slips,
falls -- but this fall is hidden from us. Moreover, as it is written, the book seems to develop only
in order to forget this truth, and ramifies into diversions where the unexpressed signals to us
from further and further away. In his letters Rilke always spoke of the young Malte as a being
struggling in an ordeal which he was bound to lose. 
Has this test not surpassed his strength, has he not failed to withstand it even though he was
convinced in his mind of its necessity, so convinced that he pursued it with such instinctive
perseverence that in the end it attached itself to him never again to leave him? This book of
Malte Laurids Brigge, if ever it is written, will be nothing but the book of this discovery,
presented in someone for whom it was too strong. Perhaps, after all, he did stand the test
victoriously, for he wrote the death of the Chamberlain. But, like Raskolnikov, exhausted by his
action, he remained on the road, incapable of continuing to act at the moment the action was to

happens in all mediations, what was the reality and the force that surpass us runs the risk, by
modifying itself according to our measure, of losing the significance of its immoderation.
Strangeness surmounted dissolves into a pallid intimacy which only teaches us our own
knowledge. Rilke said of death: "Be satisfied to believe that it is a friend, your profoundest
friend, perhaps the only friend never to be alienated by our actions and waverings, never."
Perhaps the experience ceases, thus, utterly to derail us, but thus it leaves us on the old track
of our habitual reality. In order to be "the awakener," it must be "the stranger." One cannot at
once draw death close and hope that it will teach us the truth of the remote. Rilke also says,
"Death is not beyond our strength; it is the measuring mark at the top of the vase; we are full
each time we want to reach it, and for us to be filled means to be heavy: that is all. "Here,
death is the sign of a full existence: the fear of dying would be fear of that weight by which
we are plenitude and authenticity; it would be tepid preference for insufficiency. The desire to
die would express, on the contrary then, a certain need for plenitude; it would be the aspiring
movement toward the brim, the impulse of liquid that wants to fill the vase. But is reaching
the brim enough? "To overflow"; that is the secret liquid passion, the one that knows no
measure. And overflowing does not signify plenitude, but emptiness, the excess by
comparison to which fullness is still lacking.

begin, so that his liberty, conquered anew, turned against him and destroyed him without
resistance. 12
Malte's is the discovery of that force too great for us, impersonal death, which is the excess of
our strength, that which exceeds it, that which would make our strength prodigious if we
succeeded in making it ours anew. He could not master this discovery, he could not make it the
basis of his art. What happens, then?
For some time yet I will still be able to write all this and bear witness to it. But the day will come
when my hand will be far from me, and when I order it to write, it will trace words to which I
will not have consented. The time of that other interpretation will come, when the words will
come apart, when all meaning will dissolve like clouds and fall down like rain. Despite my fear, I
am like someone on the brink of great things, and I remember that I used to feel such glimmers
within myself when I was going to write. But this time I will be written. I am the impression that
will be transformed. Just a little more and I could, ah! understand all this, acquiesce in
everything. Only one step, and my profound misery would be happiness. But I cannot take this
step; I have fallen and cannot get up because I am broken.
One might well say that the narrative ends here; this is its extreme dénouement, beyond which
everything must fall silent, and yet, strangely, these pages are on the contrary only the beginning 
of the book, which not only continues, but bit by bit and in the entire second part moves steadily
further from the immediate personal ordeal, no longer makes any allusion to it except with a
prudent reserve, if we assume that Malte, when he speaks of the somber death of Charles the
Fearless or of the King's madness, does so in order not to speak of his own death or of his
madness. Everything conspires to suggest that Rilke hid the end of the book at the beginning, in
order to demonstrate to himself that after this end something remains possible, that it is not the
frightful final line after which there is nothing more to say. And we know that, nevertheless, the
completion of Malte marked for its author the beginning of a crisis that lasted ten years. No
doubt the crisis had

12[Quotations from Rilke's correspondence are translated with an eye to Jane Bannard Green

York: Norton Press, 1945-48 -- Trans.]

other deep levels, but Rilke himself always connected it with this book where he felt he had said
everything and yet had hidden the essential, so that his hero, his double, still hovered about him,
like an ill-buried dead man who kept wanting to find a dwelling in his gaze. "I am still
convalescing from that book" ( 1912). "Can you understand that after that book I have been left
behind just like a survivor, at a loss in the deepest region of myself, unoccupied, unoccupiable?"
( 1911). "In consistent despair, Malte has come up behind everything, to a certain extent behind
death, so that nothing is possible for me any more, not even dying" ( 1910). We must retain this
expression, which is rare in Rilke's experience and which shows the experience opened onto that
nocturnal region where death no longer appears as possibility proper, but as the empty depths of
the impossible, a region from which he most often turns aside, in which he will nonetheless
wander ten years, called into it by the work and the work's demand.
He endures this ordeal with patience, a painful consternation, and the disquietude of a wanderer
who has no relationships even to himself. It has been observed that in four and a half years he
lives in fifty or so different locations. In 1919 he writes again to a friend, "My inner self has
closed up steadily as if to protect itself; it has become inaccessible to me, and now I do not know
whether in my heart there is still the strength to enter into world relationships and to realize
them, or whether only the tomb of my former spirit has quietly remained there." Why these
difficulties? They arise because the whole problem for him is to begin from the point at which
the "vanished one" was destroyed. How can a beginning be made from the impossible? "For five
years, ever since Malte was finished, I have been living like a rank beginner and in truth like
someone who does not begin." Later, when his patience and his consent have extricated him
from this "lost and desolate region" by permitting him to encounter his true poet's language, that
of the Elegies, he will say concisely that in this new work, starting from the same givens which
had made Malte's existence impossible, life becomes possible again, and he will say moreover
that he has not found the way out by backing up, but on the contrary, by pushing further on upon
the hard road.
2. Death's Space
In the Elegies, the affirmation of life and that of death are revealed as one. To admit of one
without the other -- we celebrate this 

discovery here -- a limitation which in the end excludes all that is infinite. Death is the side of
life which is not turned toward us, nor do we shed any light upon it. We must try to become as
fully conscious as possible of our existence which is at home in both unbounded realms and is
nourished forever by both. . . . The true form of life extends through both spheres, the blood of
the mightiest circulation flows through both: there is neither a here nor a beyond but the great
unity.
The fame which has greeted this letter to Hulewicz and made the thoughts by which Rilke tried
to comment upon his poems better known than the poems shows how much we like to substitute
interesting ideas for the pure poetic movement. And it is striking that the poet too is constantly
tempted to unburden himself of the dark language, not by expressing it, but by understanding it --
as if, in the anguish of words which he is called upon only to write and never to read, he wanted
to persuade himself that in spite of everything he understands himself; he has the right to read
and comprehend.
The Other Side
Rilke's reading has "raised" a part of his work to the level of ideas. It has translated his
experience. Rilke rejects the Christian solution, this is well known. It is here below, "in a purely
earthly consciousness, profoundly, blessedly terrestrial," that death is a beyond to be learned by
us, recognized and welcomed -- perhaps furthered. Death exists not only, then, at the moment of
death; at all times we are its contemporaries. Why, therefore, can we not accede immediately to
that other side, which is life itself but related otherwise, become other, the other relation? One
might be content to recognize the definition of this region in its inaccessibility: it is "the side
which is not turned toward us, nor do we shed light upon it." Thus it would be what essentially
escapes, a kind of transcendence, but of which we cannot say that it has value and reality, about
which we know only this: that we are turned away from it.
But why "turned away"? What makes us necessarily unable in our own fashion to turn back? Our
limits, apparently: we are limited beings. When we look in front of us, we do not see what is
behind. When we are here, it is on the condition that we renounce elsewhere. The limit retains
us, contains us, thrusts us back toward what we are, turns us

back toward ourselves, away from the other, makes of us averted beings. To accede to the other
side would be thus to enter into the liberty of that which is free of limits. But are we not, in a
way, beings freed from the here and now? I see, perhaps, only what is in front of me, but I can
represent to myself what is behind. Thanks to consciousness, am I not at all times elsewhere
from where I am, always master of the other and capable of something else? Yes, it is true, but
this is also our sorrow. Through consciousness we escape what is present, but we are delivered to
representation. Through representation we reintroduce into our intimacy with ourselves the
constraints of the face-to-face encounter; we confront ourselves, even when we look despairingly
outside of ourselves.
This is called destiny: being face to face
and nothing else, and always opposite. 
Such is the human condition: to be able to relate only to things which turn us away from other
things and, graver still, to be present to ourselves in everything and in this presence not to meet
anything except head-on, separate from it by this vis-à-vis and separated from ourselves by this
interposition of ourselves.
At this juncture one can say that what excludes us from the limitless is what makes us beings
deprived of limits. We believe ourselves to be turned away by each finite thing from the
infinitude of all things. But we are no less turned away from each thing by the way in which we
grasp it, representing it to make it ours -- to make of it an object, an objective reality, to establish
it in our utilitarian world by withdrawing it from the purity of space. "The other side" is where
we would cease to be turned away from a single thing by our way of looking at it, averted from it
by our gaze.
With all its eyes the creature sees
the Open. Our eyes only are
as if reversed.
To accede to the other side would thus be to transform our way of having access. Rilke is very
tempted to see consciousness, as his era conceived of it, as the principal difficulty. In a letter of
February 25, 1926 he specifies

that it is the low "degree of consciousness" which puts the animal at an advantage by permitting
it to enter into reality without having to be the center of it. "By Open we do not mean the sky, the
air, space -- which for the observer are still objects, and thus opaque. The animal, the flower is
all that without realizing it, and has thus before itself, beyond itself, that indescribably open
freedom which, for us, has its extremely short-lived equivalents perhaps only in the first instants
of love -- when one being sees in the other, in the beloved, his own extension -- or again in the
outpouring to God."
It is clear that Rilke confronts here the idea of consciousness closed upon itself, inhabited by
images. The animal is where it looks, and its look does not reflect it, nor does it reflect the thing,
but opens the animal onto the thing. The other side, then, which Rilke also calls "the pure
relation," is the purity of the relation: the fact of being, in this relation, outside oneself, in the
thing itself, and not in a representation of the thing. Death in this sense would be the equivalent
of what has been called intentionality. Because of death "we look out with a great animal gaze."
Through death the eyes turn back, and this return is the other side, and the other side is the fact of
living no longer turned away, but turned back, introduced into the intimacy of conversion, not
deprived of consciousness but established by consciousness outside it, cast into the ecstasy of
this movement.
Let us reflect upon the two obstacles. The first stems from the locality of beings, their temporal
or spatial limit -- from, that is, what could be called a "bad extension," where one thing
necessarily supplants another, can't be seen except hiding the other, etc. The second difficulty
comes from a bad interiority, that of consciousness, where we are no doubt free from the limits
of the here and now, where in the matrix of our intimacy everything is at our disposal, but where
we are also excluded by this closed intimacy from true access to everything -- excluded, 
moreover, from things by the imperious, the violent way we master them, by the purposeful
activity that makes us possessors, producers, concerned with results and avid for objects.
On the one hand, then, a bad space, on the other a bad "interior." On the one hand, nevertheless,
reality and the force of the exterior; on the other, the profundity of intimacy, the freedom and
silence of the

invisible. Mightn't there be a point where space is at once intimacy and exteriority, a space
which, outside, would in itself be spiritual intimacy? An intimacy which, in us, would be the
reality of the outdoors, such that there we would be within ourselves outside in the intimacy and
in the intimate vastness of that outside? This is what Rilke's experience -- which had at first a
"mystical" form (the one he encounters at Capri and at Duino), 13 then the form of the poetic
experience -- leads him to recognize, or at least to glimpse and sense, and perhaps to call forth by
expressing it. He names it Weltinnenraum, the world's inner space, which is no less things'
intimacy than ours, and the free communication from one to the other, the strong, unrestrained
freedom where the pure force of the undetermined is affirmed.
Through all beings spreads the one space:
the world's inner space. Silently fly the birds
all through us. O I who want to grow,
I look outside, and it is in me that the tree grows! 14
The World's Inner Space
What can be said of it? What exactly is this interiority of the exterior, this extension within us
where "the infinite," as Rilke says at the time of the Capri experience, "penetrates so intimately
that it is as though the shining stars rested lightly in his breast"? Can we truly accede to this
space? And how can we? For consciousness is our destiny; we cannot leave it; and in it we are
never in space but in the vis-à-vis of representation where we are always busy, moreover -- busy
acting, doing and possessing. Rilke never departs from the decided affirmation of the Open, but
his estimate of our power to approach it varies greatly. Sometimes it seems that man is always
excluded from it. At other times Rilke allows a hope for the "great movements of love," when
you go beyond the beloved, when you are true to the audacity of this movement which knows
neither stop nor limit, neither wants nor is able to rest in the person sought, but destroys this
person or surpasses him in order that he not be the screen that would hide the outside. These are
such grave conditions that they make us prefer failure. To love is always to love someone, to
have someone before you, to look only at him and not beyond him -- if not inadvertently, in the
leap of passion that knows nothing of ends. And so love finally turns us away, rather than turning

us back. Even the child, who is nearer the pure danger of immediate life, 
. . . the young child, already
we turn him around and force him to look backwards
at the world of forms and not into the Open, which
in the animal's face is so profound.
And even the animal, "whose Being is infinite for it, inconceivable, unreflective," even the
animal which, "where we see the future, sees everything, and sees itself in everything and safe
forever" -- sometimes the animal too bears "the weight and the care of a great sadness," the
uneasiness that comes of being separated from original bliss and as if removed from the intimacy
of its own breath.
Thus one could say that the Open is absolutely uncertain and that never, upon any face or in any
gaze, have we perceived its reflection, for all mirroring is already that of a figurative reality.
"Always it is the world and never a Nowhere without no." This uncertainty is essential: to
approach the Open as something sure would surely be to miss it. What is striking, and
characteristic of Rilke, is how much nevertheless he remains certain of the uncertain, how he
tries to set aside its doubtfulness, to affirm it in hope rather than in anguish, with a confidence
not unaware that the task is difficult but which constantly renews the glad forecast. It is as if he
were sure that there is in us, on account of the very fact that we are "turned away," the possibility
of turning back, the promise of an essential reconversion.
In fact, if we come back to the two obstacles which in life keep us turned toward a limited life, it
seems that the principal obstacle -- since we see animals, who are free of it, accede to what is
closed for us -- is the bad interiority which is our own. And it seems that this bad consciousness
can, from the imprisoning or banishing power which it was, become the power of welcome and
adherence: no longer that which separates us from real things, but that which restores them to us
at the point where they escape divisible space and enter the essential extension. Our bad
consciousness is bad, not because it is interior and because it is freedom outside objective limits,
but because it is not interior enough and because it is by no means free. For in it, as in the bad
outside, objects reign, along with the concern for results, the desire to have, the greed that links
us to possession, the need for security and stability, the tendency to know in order to be sure, the
tendency to "take account" which necessarily becomes an inclination to count and to reduce
everything to accounts -- the very destiny of the modern world.

If there is hope, then, for our turning back, it lies in our turning away always more, through a
conversion of the consciousness. Instead of leading consciousness back toward that which we
call the real but which is only the objective reality where we dwell in the security of stable forms
and separate existences -- instead, also, of maintaining consciousness at its own surface, in the
world of representations which is only the double of objects -- such a conversion would turn it
away toward a profounder intimacy, toward the most interior and the most invisible, where we
are no longer anxious to do and act, but free of ourselves and of real things and of phantoms of
things, "abandoned, exposed upon the mountains of the heart," as close as possible to the point
where "the interior and the exterior gather themselves together into a single continuous space."
Novalis had certainly expressed a similar aspiration when he said: "We dream of voyaging
across the universe. Isn't the universe, then, in us? We do not know the depths of our mind. 
Toward the interior goes the mysterious road. Eternity with its worlds, past and future, is in us."
Nor is there any doubt that Kierkegaard says something that Rilke understood when he awakens
the deep reaches of subjectivity and wants to free it from general categories and possibilities so
as to grasp it afresh in its singularity. However, Rilke's experience has its own particular
features: it is foreign to the imperious and magic violence by which, in Novalis, the interior
affirms and gives rise to the exterior. And it is no less foreign to all surpassing of the earthly: if
the poet goes further and further inward, it is not in order to emerge in God, but in order to
emerge outside and to be faithful to the earth, to the plenitude and the superabundance of earthly
existence when it springs forth outside all limits, in its excessive force that surpasses all
calculation. Moreover, Rilke's experience has its own tasks. They are essentially those of the
poetic word. And it is in this that his thought rises to a greater height. Here the theistic
temptations which encumber his ideas on death fade, as do his hypotheses on consciousness and
even the idea of the Open, which sometimes tends to become an existing region and not
existence itself in its demandingness, or the excessive, limitless intimacy of this demand.
Conversion: Transmutation into Invisibility
And yet what happens when, turning always further away from the exterior, we descend toward
that imaginary space, the heart's intimacy?

One might suppose that consciousness is seeking unconsciousness as its solution; that it dreams
of dissolving in an instinctive blindness where it would regain the great unknowing purity of the
animal. This is not the case. Instead (except in the Third Elegy where the elemental speaks),
Rilke experiences this interiorization as a transmutation of significations themselves. It is a
matter -- he says so in his letter to Hulewicz -- of "becoming as fully conscious as possible of our
existence." And he says in the same letter: "All the configurations of the here and now are to be
used not in a time-bound way, but, as far as we are able, to be placed in those superior
significances in which we have a share." The words "superior significances" indicate that this
interiorization which reverses the consciousness's destiny by purifying it of everything it
represents and produces, of everything that makes it a substitute for the objective real which we
call the world (a conversion which cannot be compared to phenomenological reduction, but
which nonetheless evokes it), does not go toward the void of unknowing, but toward higher or
more demanding meanings -- closer too, perhaps, to their source. Thus this more inner
consciousness is also more conscious, which for Rilke means that "in it we are introduced into
the givens of earthly existence independent of time and space" (it is only a matter, then, of a
broader, more distended consciousness). But more conscious also means: more pure, closer to
the demand that founds the consciousness and that makes it not the bad intimacy which closes us
in, but the force of the surpassing where intimacy is the bursting and springing of the outside.
But how is this conversion possible? How is it accomplished? And what gives it authority and
reality, if it is not to be reduced to the uncertainty of "extremely momentary" and perhaps always
unreal states?
Through conversion everything is turned inward. This means that we turn ourselves, but that we
also turn everything, all the things we have to do with. That is the essential point. Man is linked
to things, he is in the midst of them, and if he renounces his realizing and representing activity, if
he apparently withdraws into himself, it is not in order to dismiss everything which isn't he, the 
humble and outworn realities, but rather to take these with him, to make them participate in this
interiorization where they lose their use value, their falsified nature, and lose also their narrow
boundaries in order to penetrate into their true profundity. Thus does this conversion appear as an
immense task of transmutation, in which things, all things, are transformed and interiorized by
becoming interior in us and by becoming interior to themselves. This transformation of the
visible into the invisible and of the invisible into the always more invisible takes place where the
fact of being unrevealed does not

express a simple privation, but access to the other side "which is not turned toward us nor do we
shed light upon it." Rilke has repeated this in many ways, and these formulae are among the best
known to the French reader: "We are the bees of the Invisible. We ardently suck the honey of the
visible in order to accumulate it in the great golden hive of the Invisible." "Our task is to
impregnate the provisional and perishable earth so profoundly in our mind, with so much
patience and passion, that its essence can be reborn in us invisible."
Every man is called upon to take up again the mission of Noah. He must become the intimate
and pure ark of all things, the refuge in which they take shelter, where they are not content to be
kept as they are, as they imagine themselves to be -- narrow, outworn, so many traps for life --
but are transformed, lose their form, lose themselves to enter into the intimacy of their reserve,
where they are as if preserved from themselves, untouched, intact, in the pure point of the
undetermined. Yes, every man is Noah, but on closer inspection, he is Noah in a strange way,
and his mission consists less in saving everything from the flood than, on the contrary, in
plunging all things into a deeper flood where they disappear prematurely and radically. That, in
fact, is what the human vocation amounts to. If it is necessary that everything visible become
invisible, if this metamorphosis is the goal, our intervention is apparently quite superficial: the
metamorphosis is accomplished perfectly of itself, for everything is perishable, for, says Rilke in
the same letter, "the perishable is everywhere engulfed in a deep being." What have we then to
do, we who are the least durable, the most prompt to disappear? What have we to offer in this
task of salvation? Precisely that: our promptness at disappearing, our aptitude for perishing, our
fragility, our exhaustion, our gift for death.
Death's Space and the Word's
Here again, then, is the truth of our condition and the weight of our problem. Rilke, at the end of
the Elegies, uses this expression: "the infinitely dead." An ambiguous formula. But one can say
of men that they are infinitely mortal, a little more than mortal. Everything is perishable, but we
are the most perishable; all things pass, and are transformed, but we want transformation, we
want to pass, and our will is this passing on, further. Hence the call: "Want change" ("Wolle die
Wandlung"). We must not rest, but pass on. "Nowhere is there

staying" ("Bleiben ist nirgends"). "Whatever closes itself into staying the same is already
petrified." To live is always already to take leave, to be dismissed and to dismiss what is. But we
can get ahead of this separation and, looking at it as though it were behind us, make of it the
moment when, even now, we touch the abyss and accede to the deep of being. 
Thus we see that conversion -- the movement toward the most interior, a work in which we
transform ourselves as we transform everything -- has something to do with our end, and that this
transformation, this fruition of the visible in the invisible for which we are responsible, is the
very task of dying, which has until now been so difficult for us to recognize. It takes effort, yet
effort evidently quite different from that which we put into making objects and projecting results.
We even see now that it is the opposite of purposeful work, although similar in one point. For in
both cases it is certainly a matter of "transformation." In the world things are transformed into
objects in order to be grasped, utilized, made more certain in the distinct rigor of their limits and
the affirmation of a homogeneous and divisible space. But in imaginary space things are
transformed into that which cannot be grasped. Out of use, beyond wear, they are not in our
possession but are the movement of dispossession which releases us both from them and from
ourselves. They are not certain but are joined to the intimacy of the risk where neither they nor
we are sheltered any more, but where we are, rather, introduced, utterly without reserve, into a
place where nothing retains us at all.
In a poem, one of his last, Rilke says that interior space "translates things." It makes them pass
from one language to another, from the foreign, exterior language into a language which is
altogether interior and which is even the interior of language, where language names in silence
and by silence, and makes of the name a silent reality. "Space (which) exceeds us and translates
things" is thus the transfigurer, the translator par excellence. But this statement suggests more: is
there not another translator, another space where things cease to be visible in order to dwell in
their invisible intimacy? Certainly, and we can boldly give it its name. This essential translator is
the poet, and this space is the poem's space, where no longer is anything present, where in the
midst of absence everything speaks, everything returns into the spiritual accord which is open
and not immobile but the center of the eternal movement. 15

15To praise the poetry of Jacobsen, Rilke says, "One does not know where the verbal weave
finishes or where the space begins."

If the metamorphosis of the visible into the invisible is our task, if it is the truth of conversion,
then there is a point at which we see it through without losing it in the evanescence of "extremely
momentary" states: this point is the word. To speak is essentially to transform the visible into the
invisible; it is to enter a space which is not divisible, an intimacy which, however, exists outside
oneself. To speak is to take one's position at the point where the word needs space to reverberate
and be heard, and where space, becoming the word's very movement, becomes hearing's
profundity, its vibration. "How," says Rilke, in a text written in French, "how could one sustain,
how could one save the visible, if not by creating the language of absence, of the invisible?"
The Open ir the poem. The space where everything returns to deep being, where there is
infinite passage between the two domains, where everything dies but where death is the learned
companion of life, where horror is ravishing joy, where celebration laments and lamentation
praises -- the very space toward which "all worlds hasten as toward their nearest and truest
reality," the space of the mightiest circulation and of ceaseless metamorphosis -- this is the
poem's space. This is the Orphic space to which the poet doubtless has no access, where he can
penetrate only to disappear, which he attains only when he is united with the intimacy of the 
breach that makes him a mouth unheard, just as it makes him who hears into the weight of
silence. The Open is the work, but the work as origin.
Song as Origin: Orpheus
When Rilke exalts Orpheus, when he exalts the song which is being, he is not speaking of the
ultimate perfection of a song which begins by being sung, or even of the fullness of song, but of
song as origin and the origin of song. There is, it is true, an essential ambiguity in the figure of
Orpheus. This ambiguity belongs to the myth which preserves the figure and is its reserve, but
the ambiguity also stems from the uncertainty in Rilke's thoughts, from the way in which, little
by little in the course of the experience, he dissolved the substance and reality of death. Orpheus
is not like the Angel in whom the transformation is achieved, who is unaware of its risks but also
of its protection and significance. Orpheus is the act of metamorphosis: not the Orpheus who has
conquered death, but he who always dies, who is the demand that we disappear and who
disappears in the anguish of this disappearance, an anguish which becomes song, a word which
is the pure

movement of dying. Orpheus dies a little more than we do, he is we ourselves bearing the
anticipated knowledge of out death, knowledge which is dispersion's intimacy. If the poem could
become a poet, Orpheus would be the poem: he is the ideal and the emblem of poetic plenitude.
Yet he is at the same time not the completed poem, but something more mysterious and more
demanding: the origin of the poem, the sacrificial point which is no longer the reconciliation of
the two domains, but the abyss of the lost god, the infinite trace of absence, a moment to which
Rilke comes closest perhaps in these three lines:
O you, lost god! You, infinite trace!
By dismembering you the hostile forces had to disperse you
To make of us now hearers and a mouth of Nature.
This ambiguity manifests itself in many ways. Sometimes it seems that, for Rilke, what makes
the human word heavy, foreign to the purity of becoming, is also what makes it more expressive,
more capable of its proper mission -- the metamorphosis of the visible into invisibility where the
Open is at hand. The world's inner space requires the restraint of human language in order truly
to be affirmed. It is only pure and only true within the strict limitations of this word.
The one space through which birds plunge is not
the intimate space which sets off your face
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Space exceeds us and translates things:
That the tree's being may succeed for you,
cast around it the inner space, that space
which announces itself in you. Surround it with restraint.
It knows not how to limit itself. Only in taking form
from your renunciation does it truly become a tree. 16
Here the task of the poet is that of a mediation which Hölderlin was first to express and
celebrate. 17 The poet's destiny is to expose himself to the force of the undetermined and to the 
pure violence of being from which nothing can be made, to endure this force courageously, but
also to contain it by imposing upon it restraint and the perfection of a form. This is a requirement
full of risk:

16Poem dated June 1924.
17At least in the hymn, So, on a festival day . . .

Why must someone stand here like a shepherd,
Exposed thus to such excess of influence?
Yet it is a task which consists, not in surrendering to being's unresolvable ambiguity, but in
giving it decisiveness, exactitude, and form, or, as he says, in "making things from anguish": in
lifting the uncertainty of anguish to the resolution of an exact formulation. We know how much
the concern to give expression to things, and to express them with the finite words that suit them,
counted for Rilke. In this respect, the inexpressible seems beside the point to him. To speak is
our task, to tell finite things in an accomplished fashion that excludes the infinite is our power,
because we are ourselves finite beings, anxious to come to a finish and able, in the realm of the
finite, to grasp completion. Here the Open closes under the constraint of a language so
determined that, far from being the pure milieu where conversion to the interior and
transmutation into invisibility are achieved, it transforms itself into a graspable thing, becomes
the discourse of the world, a language where things are not transformed but immobilized, fixed
in their visible aspect, as it sometimes happens in the Expressionist part of Rilke's work, the
Neue Gedichte, a work of the eye and not of the heart, Hetzwerk.
18
Or, on the contrary, the poet turns toward the most inward as toward the source whose pure,
silent surging must be preserved. Then the true poem is no longer the word that captures, the
closed space of the telling word, but the breathing intimacy whereby the poet consumes himself
in order to augment space and dissipates himself rhythmically: a pure inner burning around
nothing.
Breathing, O invisible poem!
World's space which purely and always
exchanges itself for very being. Counterweight,
in which rhythmically I am achieved.
. . . . . . . . . . .
A gain in space.
And in another sonnet:
To sing in truth is a different breath
A breath around nothing. A stirring in God. The wind.

18So he says to himself, after finishing the Neue Gedichte:
The work of vision is done
Now do the work of the heart. 

"A breath around nothing." That is something like the truth of the poem when it is no longer
anything but a silent intimacy, a pure expenditure in which our life is sacrificed -- and not in
view of any result, in order to conquer or acquire, but for nothing, in the pure relation to which
the symbolic name of God is given here. "To sing is a different breath": it is no longer the
language which is graspable and grasping affirmation, covetousness and conquest, the breathing
that is aspiration as much as respiration, which is always in quest of something, which is durable
and wants duration. In the song, to speak is to pass on, to consent to the passage which is pure
decline, and language is no longer anything but "that profound innocence of the human heart
through which it is able to describe, in its irresistible fall all the way to its ruin, a pure line."
Metamorphosis, then, appears as the happy consumption of being when, without reserve, it
enters into the movement where nothing is preserved, which does not realize, accomplish, or
save anything, which is the pure felicity of descending, the joy of the fall, the jubilant word
which one unique time gives voice to disappearance, before disappearing into it:
Here, among those who pass, in the Kingdom of decline, Be the glass that rings and, in the
brilliant resonance, is already broken.
But, one has immediately to add, Rilke also, and much more gladly, conceives of metamorphosis
as an entrance into the eternal, and of imaginary space as liberation from time the destroyer. "It
would seem to me almost wrong still to call time what was rather a state of liberty, in a very
perceptible way a space, the environment of the Open, and not the act of passing." 19 Sometimes,
in his last works, he seems to allude to a completed time which would hold still in a pure circle
of time closed upon itself. But whether space is this time risen above the passing moment, or the
space which "drinks absent presence" and changes duration into timelessness, it appears as the
center where what is no longer still subsists. And our vocation, to establish things and ourselves
in this space, is, not to disappear, but to perpetuate: to save things, yes, to make them invisible,
but in order that they be reborn in their invisibility. And so death, that readier death which is our
destiny, again becomes the promise of survival, and already the moment is at hand

19Kein Vergehn: Rilke opposes "space" here, and "the Open," to consumption by time, the fall
toward the end.

when dying for Rilke will be to escape death -- a strange volatization of his experience. What
does it mean and how is it accomplished?
3. Death's Transmutation
It is in the Ninth Elegy that Rilke indicates the power which belongs to us -- to us the most
perishable of all beings -- to save what will last longer than we.
And these things whose life is decline understand that you praise them; fleeting, they lend us, us
the most fleeting, the power to save. They want us to change them in the bottom of our invisible
heart into -- O infinite -- into ourselves! whatsoever we may be in the end. 
Such, then, is our privilege. Granted, it is linked to our gift for disappearing, but only because in
this disappearance the power to conserve is also manifest, and because in this readier death
resurrection is expressed, the joy of a transfigured life.
We are imperceptibly approaching the instant in Rilke's experience when dying will not be to
die, but to transform the fact of death, and when the effort to teach us not to deny the extreme but
to expose ourselves to the overpowering intimacy of our end will culiminate in the peaceful
affirmation that there is no death, that "close to death, one no longer sees death." The animal who
lives in the Open is "free of death." But we, to the extent that ours is necessarily the perspective
of a life which is limited and maintained between limits, "we see only death."
Death, we see only death; the free animal always has its decline behind it, and before it God, and
when it moves, it moves in Eternity, as springs flow.
Death, "to see only death," is thus the error of a limited life and of a poorly converted
consciousness. Death is that very concern to delimit which we introduce into being; it is the
result and perhaps the means of the bad transmutation by which we make of all thing objects --
tightly closed, well-finished realities imbued with our preoccupation with the finish. Freedom
must be liberation from death, the approach toward the point where death becomes transparent.

For close to death one no longer sees death, and one stares outward, perhaps with a great animal
gaze.
Thus we should say no longer now that death is the side of life from which we are turned away.
It is only the error in this turning: aversion. Wherever we turn away, there is death, and what we
call the moment of dying is only the crook of the turn, the extreme of its curvature, the end point
beyond which everything reverses itself, everything turns back. This is so true that in the ordeal
of conversion -- that return inward by which we go into ourselves outside of ourselves -- if we
are somehow stolen from death it is because without even perceiving it we pass the instant of
dying, having gone too far, inattentive and as if distracted, neglecting what we would have to
have done to die (be afraid, hold onto the world, want to do something). And in this negligence
death has become forgetfulness; we have forgotten to die. After the account of his two mystical
experiences, Capri and Duino, where for the first time he seems to have felt what after 1914 he
will call the world's inner space, Rilke, speaking of himself in the third person, adds:
In fact he had been free for a long time, and if something prevented his dying, perhaps it was
only this: that he had overlooked it once, somewhere, and that he didn't have, like others, to go
on ahead in order to reach it, but on the contrary, to go back the other way. His action was
already outside, in the confident things that children play with, and was perishing in them. 20
The Intimacy of Invisible Death
It might seem surprising that he should be so little disturbed by this volatization of the
experience to which he devotes himself. The explanation is that this very evanescence expresses
the movement toward which he tends profoundly. Just as each thing must become invisible,
likewise what makes death a thing, the brute fact of death, must become invisible. Death enters
into its own invisibility, passes from its opacity to its transparency, from its terrifying reality to
its ravishing unreality. It is in this passage its own conversion; through this conversion it is the 
ungraspable, the invisible -- the source, however, of all invisibility. And suddenly we understand
why Rilke always kept silent,

20[Here I have compared Blanchot's French with G. Craig Houston's English translation of the
German, Selected Works, ( New York: New Directions, 1967), vol. 2 -- Trans.]

even to himself, about the death of Malte. Not to perceive this death was to give it its one chance
to be authentic. Ignorance made it not the fatal error of the terrible limit against which we are
broken, but the bloom of the glad moment when, by interiorizing itself, it loses itself in its own
intimacy. And likewise, in his last illness, he wanted not to know of what he was dying or that he
was going to die: "Rilke's conversations with his doctor invariably reflect his desire that his pain
be no one's. . . . Strange conversations," recounts Dr. Haemmerli. "They always went right up to
the point where the sick man would have had to pronounce the word death, but at which all at
once he stopped prudently." This prudence is difficult to interpret. One doesn't know whether the
desire "not to see death" expresses fear of seeing it, elusiveness and flight before the
inconceivable, or, on the contrary, the profound intimacy which creates silence, imposes silence,
and turns into ignorance in order not to stay within the boundaries of limited knowledge.
Thus we see more clearly how Rilke's thoughts have shifted since the days when he wished for a
personal death. As before -- although he no longer expresses the distinction in such a decisive
fashion -- he remains willing to speak of two deaths, to see in one sheer death, death's pure
transparency, but in the other the opaque and impure. And as before -- more precisely than
before -- he sees between these two deaths the difference made by an expenditure of effort, by a
transmutation: either because bad death, the one that has the brutality of an event and of a
random occurrence, remains an untransmuted death, a death not reintroduced into its essential
secret, or because it becomes in true death the intimacy of transmutation.
Another aspect of his thought which gains precision is that this task of transmutation, which
infinitely exceeds us and cannot result from our wordly aptitude for acting and doing, is only
accomplished in us by death itself -- as if, in us alone, death could purify, could interiorize itself
and apply to its own reality that power of metamorphosis, that force of invisibility whose original
profundity it is. And why is it in us, in humans, of all beings the most fragile, that death finds this
perfection? It is because not only do we number among those who pass away, but in this
kingdom of decline we are also those who consent to pass, who say yes to disappearance and in
whom disappearance becomes speech, becomes word and song. Thus death is in us the purity of
dying because it can reach the point where it sings, because it finds in us "that . . identity of
absence and presence" which is manifest in the song, the extreme tip of fragility which at the
moment of breaking

resonates, whose vibration is the pure resonance of the very break. Rilke affirms that death is
"der eigentliche Ja-sager," the authentic yea-sayer, it says only yes. But this only happens in the
being that has the power to speak, just as speaking is not truly speech and essential word except
in this absolute yes where the word gives voice to death's intimacy. Thus there is a secret identity
between singing and dying, between death -- the transmutation of the invisible by the invisible -- 
and the song within which this transmutation is accomplished. We come back here to what
Kafka, at least in the sentences we ascribed to him, seemed to seek to express: I write to die, to
give death its essential possibility, through which it is essentially death, source of invisibility; but
at the same time, I cannot write unless death writes in me, makes of me the void where the
impersonal is affirmed.
No One's Death
The word impersonal which we introduce here indicates the difference between the outlooks of
the early and the late Rilke. If death is the heart of the transparency where it infinitely transforms
itself, there can no longer be any question of a personal death, where I would die in the
affirmation of my own reality and my unique existence, a death such that I would be supremely
invisible in it and it visible in me (with that monumental character which death has in Brigge the
Chamberlain during his lifetime). And my prayer can no longer be:
Oh Lord, grant to each his own death, the dying which truly evolves from this life where he
found love, meaning and distress
but rather: Grant me the death which is not mine, the death of no one, the dying which truly
evolves from death, where I am not called upon to die, which is not an event -- an event that
would be proper to me, which would happen to me alone -- but the unreality and the absence
where nothing happens, where neither love not meaning nor distress accompanies me, but the
pure abandon of all that.
Rilke is doubtless unwilling to restore to death the lowly impersonality which would make of it
something less than personal, something always improper. The impersonality toward which
death tends in Rilke is ideal. It is above the person: not the brutality of a fact or the randomness
of chance, but the volatization of the very fact of death, its transfiguration at its own center.
Moreover, the ambiguity of

the word eigen (der eigene Tod, "death proper"), which means "own," proper to me as well as
authentic, is significant here. ( Heidegger seems to dwell on this ambiguity when he speaks of
death as the absolutely proper possibility, by which he means that death is the uttermost
possibility, the most extreme thing that happens to the self, but also the "ownmost," the most
personal event to befall the "I," the event where "I" affirm myself the most and the most
authentically.) This ambiguity allows Rilke never to cease recognizing himself in his early
prayer: Grant to each his own, his proper death, the death which is properly death, the essential
death and the death which is essentially death; grant to me this essence which is also mine, since
it is in me that it has been purified -- that it has become, through inward conversion, through the
consent and the intimacy of my song, pure death, the purification of death by death and thus my
work, the work of art which is the passage of things into the heart of death's purity.
One must not forget, in fact, that this effort to raise death to itself, to make the point where it
loses itself within itself coincide with the point at which I lose myself outside of myself, is not a
simple internal affair, but implies an immense responsibility toward things and is possible only
through their mediation through the movement which is entrusted to me and which must raise
things themselves to a point of greater reality and truth. This is essential in Rilke. It is through 
this double requirement that he preserves in poetic existence the tension without which it would
perhaps fade into a rather pale ideality. One of the two domains must never be sacrificed to the
other: the visible is necessary to the invisible; it is saved in the invisible, but it is also what saves
the invisible. This "holy law of contrast" reestablishes between the two poles an equality of
value:
Being here below and being beyond, may both claim you Strangely, without distinction.
The Ecstatic Experience of Art
The hidden certitude that "beyond" is only another mode of being "here below" when I am no
longer simply in myself but outside, close to the sincerity of things: this is what draws me
constantly back toward their "sight," and turns me toward them so that the turning back may be
accomplished in me. In a way, I save myself no less by seeing things

than I save them by giving them access to the invisible. Everything hinges on the movement of
seeing, when in it my gaze, ceasing to direct itself forward with the pull of time that attracts it to
goals, turns back to look "as if over the shoulder, behind, toward things," in order to reach "their
closed existence," which I see then as perfected, not crumbling or being altered by the wear of
active life, but as it is in the innocence of being. I see things then with the disinterested and
somewhat distant look of someone who has just left them.
This disinterested gaze, which has no future and seems to come from the heart of death, this look
to which "all things give themselves at once more distantly and somehow more truly," is the gaze
of the mystical Duino experience, but it is also the gaze of "art." And it is correct to say that the
artist's experience is an ecstatic experience and that it is, like the Duino experience, an
experience of death. To see properly is essentially to die. It is to introduce into sight the turning
back again which is ecstasy and which is death. This does not mean that everything sinks into the
void. 21 On the contrary, things then offer themselves in the inexhaustible fecundity of their
meaning which our vision ordinarily misses -- our vision which is only capable of one point of
view. "A finch that was near him and whose blue gaze he had already met on other occasions,
touched him now across a more spiritual distance, but with such an inexhaustible significance
that it seemed nothing was hidden anymore."
Hence the unfailing fondness for things, the faithful abiding with them which Rilke advised at all
periods of his life as that which can best bring us toward a form of authenticity. It might well be
said that often when he thinks of the word absence, he thinks of what the presence of things is
for him: he thinks of that being-a-thing, humble, silent, grave obedience to the pure gravity of
forces which is repose in the web of influences and the balance of movements. Again, toward the
end of his life he said: "My world begins next to things.""I have . . . the particular happiness of
living by means of things."
There is not one thing in which I do not find myself; It is not my voice alone that sings:
everything resonates.
He considered with regret painting's tendency to depart from "the object." He sees there a
reflection of war and a mutilation. Thus, speaking of Klee, he says: 

21Although à propos of the Capri "experience," Rilke acknowledges the void: "extension"

During the war years I often thought I felt exactly this disappearance of "the object" (for the
extent to which we accept one -- and in addition aspire to express ourselves through it -- is a
matter of faith: broken beings are best expressed, then, by fragments and debris . . .). But now,
reading this book by Hausenstein, so full of intelligence, I have been able to discover in myself
an immense calm, and to understand, in spite of everything, how safe all things are for me. It
takes the obstinacy of a city dweller (and Hausenstein is one), to dare claim that nothing exists
any more. For myself, I can start afresh from your little cowslips. Really, nothing prevents me
from finding all things inexhaustible and intact: where would art find its point of departure if not
in this joy and this tension of an infinite beginning? 22
This text not only reveals Rilke's preferences in an interesting way, but brings us back to the
profound ambiguity of his experience. He says it himself: art takes its point of departure in
things, but what things? Intact things -- unverbraucht -- when they are not being used and used
up by their use in the world. Art must not, then, start from the hierarchically "ordered" things
which our "ordinary" life proposes to us. In the world's order things have being according to their
value; they have worth, and some are worth more than others. Art knows nothing of this order. It
takes an interest in realities according to an absolute disinterestedness, that infinite distance
which is death. If it starts then, from things, it starts from all things without distinction. It does
not choose, it takes its point of departure in the very refusal to choose. If the artist prefers to look
among things for "beautiful" ones, he betrays being, he betrays art. Rilke, on the contrary,
refuses to "choose between the beautiful and the unbeautiful. Each is only a space, a possibility,
and it is up to me to fill each perfectly or imperfectly." Not to choose, not to refuse anything
access to vision and, in vision, to transmutation -- to start from things, but from all things: this is
a rule which always tormented him and which he learned perhaps from Hofmannsthal. The latter,
in a 1907 essay, The Poet and These Times, said of the poet, "It is as if his eyes had no lids." He
must not leave anything out of himself, he must not withold himself from any being, from any
phantasm

is arranged in a way so little "human" that men "could only name it: emptiness."
22[The English translation from the German which I compared to Blanchot's French is by Violet
M. Macdonald ( London: Methuen & Co. Ltd., 1951) -- Trans.]

born of a human mind; he can reject no thought. Likewise in 1907 Rilke says with the same force
in a letter to Clara Rilke: "No more than one choice is permitted. He who creates cannot turn
away from any existence; a single failing anywhere at all snatches him from the state of grace,
makes him faulty through and through." The poet, lest he betray himself by betraying being,
must never "turn away." By this aversion he would surrender to bad death, the one that limits and
delimits. He must in no way defend himself; he is essentially a man without defenses:
A being with no shell, open to pain, Tormented by light, shaken by every sound. 
Rilke often used the image of the little anemone he saw one day in Rome. "It had opened so wide
during the day that it could not close up again at night." Thus, in an Orpheus sonnet, he exalts
this gift for welcoming infinitely as a symbol of poetic openness: "You, acceptance and force of
so many worlds," he says, in a line where the word Entschluss, ("resolution"), echoing the word
erschliessen ("to open"), reveals one of the sources of Heidegger's Entschlossenheit ("resolute
acceptance"). So the artist must be, and so his life. But where is this life to be found?
But when, in which of all the lives Are we at last beings who open and welcome?
If the poet is truly linked to this acceptance which doesn't choose and which seeks its starting
point not in any particular thing but in all things and, more profoundly, in a region anterior to
things, in the indeterminacy of being -- if the poet must live at the intersection of infinite
relations, in the place opened and as if void where foreign destinies cross -- then he can well say
joyfully that he takes his point of departure in things: what he calls "things" is no longer anything
but the depth of the immediate and undetermined, and what he calls point of departure is the
approach toward the point where nothing begins. It is "the tension of an infinite beginning," art
itself as origin or again the experience of the Open, the search for a true dying.
The Secret of double Death
So we have returned, now, to the center from which all the ambiguity of the movement radiates.
To start off from things, yes, that is necessary. It is they that must be saved; it is in them, by
turning authentically toward them, that we learn to turn toward the invisible, to feel

the movement of transmutation and, in this movement, to transmute transmutation itself, to the
point where it becomes the purity of death purified of dying, in the unique song where death says
yes and which, in the fullness of this yes is song's very fullness and its perfection. This
movement is certainly difficult, a long and patient experience. But at least it shows us clearly
where we must begin. Are not things given us? "For my part, I can start afresh from your little
cowslips; truly nothing prevents me from finding all things inexhaustible and intact." Yes,
"nothing prevents me" -- provided, however, that I be freed from every obstacle, from all limits.
And this liberation will be illusory if, from the first step, it is not that radical turning back which
alone makes me "him who is ready for everything, who excludes nothing," "a being with no
shell." It is necessary, then, no longer to start from things in order to make possible the approach
toward true death, but to start from the deep of death in order to turn toward the intimacy of
things -- to "see" them truly, with the disinterested gaze of him who does not cleave to himself,
who cannot say "I," who is no one: impersonal death.
To start from death? But where, now, is death? One may judge that Rilke does much to
"idealize" the ordeal of dying. He seeks to make it invisible to us, he wants to purify it of its
brutality; he sees in it a promise of unity, the hope of a larger understanding. If death is the
extreme, then it must be said that this is a very accommodating extreme, which takes such care
not to threaten our faith in the oneness of being, our sense of the whole and even our fear of
death, for this death disappears, discreetly, into itself. But this disappearance precisely, which
has its reassuring side, also has a fearful one, which is like another form of its excessiveness, the
image of what makes it an impure transcendence, that which we never meet, which we cannot
grasp: the ungraspable; absolute indeterminacy. If death's true reality is not simply what from the 
outside we call quitting life -- if death is something other than its worldly reality, and if it eludes
us, turning always away -- then this movement makes us sense not only its discretion and its
essential intimacy but also its profound unreality: death as abyss, not that which founds but the
absence and the loss of all foundation.
This is an impressive result of Rilke's experience, for it enlightens us in spite of him, as if
through the mediation of his reassuring intentions it continued to speak to us in the harsh original
language. When the force upon which he makes everything depend is detached from the moment
when it has the reality of the last instant, it escapes him and escapes us constantly. It is inevitable
but inaccessible death; it is the

abyss of the present, time without a present, with which I have no relationships; it is that toward
which I cannot go forth, for in it I do not die, I have fallen from the power to die. In it they die;
they do not cease, and they do not finish dying.
There is much to suggest that the movement by which he purifies death, by taking away its
random character, forced Rilke to incorporate this randomness in its essence, to close it upon its
absolute indeterminacy, so that instead of being only an improper and untimely event, death
becomes, at the heart of its invisibility, that which is not even an event, that which is not
accomplished, yet which is there, the part of this event which its accomplishment cannot realize.
Rilke's assertion, which has had repercussions in philosophy, that there is something like a
double death, two relations with death, one which we like to call authentic and the other
inauthentic, only expresses the doubleness within which such an event withdraws as if to
preserve the void of its secret. Inevitable, but inaccessible; certain, but ungraspable. That which
produces meaning (nothingness as the power to negate, the force of the negative, the end starting
from which man is the decision to be without being) is the risk that rejects being -- is history,
truth. It is death as the extreme of power, as my most proper possibility, but also the death which
never comes to me, to which I can never say yes, with which there is no authentic relation
possible. Indeed, I elude it when I think I master it through a resolute acceptance, for then I turn
away from what makes it the essentially inauthentic and the essentially inessential. From this
point of view, death admits of no "being for death"; it does not have the solidity which would
sustain such a relation. It is that which happens to no one, the uncertainty and the indecision of
what never happens. I cannot think about it seriously, for it is not serious. It is its own imposter;
it is disintegration, vacant debilitation -- not the term, but the interminable, not proper but
featureless death, and not true death but, as Kafka says, "the sneer of its capital error."
Orphic Space
What is, moreover, very striking in Rilke's itinerary is the way the force of the poetic experience
led him, and almost without his knowing it, from the search for a personal death -- clearly it is
with this kind of death that he feels most kinship -- to an altogether different obligation. After
having, at first, made art "the road toward myself," he feels increasingly

that this road must lead to the point where, within myself, I belong to the outside. It leads me
where I am no longer myself, where if I speak it is not I who speak, where I cannot speak. To 
encounter Orpheus is to encounter this voice which is not mine, this death which becomes song,
but which is not my death, even though I must disappear in it more profoundly.
Once and for all,
It is Orpheus when there is song. He comes and he goes.
These words seem merely to echo the ancient idea according to which there is only one poet, a
single superior power to speak which "now and again throughout time makes itself known in the
souls that submit to it." This is what Plato called enthusiasm. Closer to Rilke, Novalis had
affirmed it in his turn, in a way which the Orpheus verses seem to recall: "Klingsohr, eternal
poet, does not die, remains in the world." But Orpheus, precisely, does die, and he does not
remain: he comes and he goes. Orpheus does not symbolize the lofty transcendence of which the
poet would be the vehicle and which would lead him to say: it is not I who speak but the god
who speaks in me. Orpheus does not signify the eternity and the immutability of the poetic
sphere, but, on the contrary, links the "poetic" to an immeasurable demand that we disappear. He
is a call to die more profoundly, to turn toward a more extreme dying:
O seek to understand that he must disappear!
Even if the anguish of it dismay him.
While his word extends this world,
Already he is beyond where you may not accompany him.
. . . . . . . . . .
And he obeys by going beyond.
Through Orpheus we are reminded that speaking poetically and disappearing belong to the
profundity of a single movement, that he who sings must jeopardize himself entirely and, in the
end, perish, for he speaks only when the anticipated approach toward death, the premature
separation, the adieu given in advance obliterate in him the false certitude of being, dissipate
protective safeguards, deliver him to a limitless insecurity. Orpheus conveys all this, but he is
also a more mysterious sign. He leads and attracts us toward the point where he himself, the
eternal poem, enters into his own disappearance, where he identifies himself with the force that
dismembers him and becomes "pure contradiction," the "lost god," the god's absence, the original
void of which the first elegy speaks in connection with the myth of

Linos, and from which "the uninterrupted tidings formed of silence" propagate themselves
through terrified space -- the murmur of the interminable. Orpheus is the mysterious sign pointed
toward the origin, where not only secure existence and the hope of truth and the gods are lacking,
but also the poem; where the power to speak and the power to hear, undergoing their own lack,
endure their impossibility.
This movement is "pure contradiction." It is linked to the infinitude of the transformation which
leads us not only to death, but infinitely transmutes death itself, which makes of death the infinite
movement of dying and of him who dies him who is infinitely dead, as if in death's intimacy it
were for him a matter of dying always more, immeasurably -- of continuing inside death to make
possible the movement of transformation which must not cease, night of measureless excess,
Nacht aus Übermass, where one has in nonbeing eternally to return to being. 
Thus the rose becomes for Rilke the symbol both of poetic action and of death, when death is no
one's sleep. The rose is like the perceptible presence of Orphic space, the space which is nothing
but outerness and which is nothing but intimacy, superabundance where things do not limit or
infringe upon each other, but in their common unfurling make room instead of taking it up, and
constantly "transform the outside world . . . into a handful of Within."
Almost a being without boundaries and as if spared
and more purely inner and very strangely tender
and illuminating itself right up to the edge,
is such a thing known to us?
The poem -- and in it the poet -- is this intimacy opened to the world, unreservedly exposed to
being. It is the world, things and being ceaselessly transformed into innerness. It is the intimacy
of this transformation, an apparently tranquil and gentle movement, but which is the greatest
danger, for then the word touches the deepest intimacy, demands not only the abandonment of all
exterior assurance but risks its very self and introduces us into that point where nothing can be
said of being, nothing made, where endlessly everything starts over and where dying itself is a
task without end.
Rose, oh reiner Widerspruch, Lust
Niemandes Schlaf zu sein unter soviel
Lidern.

Rose, O pure contradiction, delight
Of being no one's sleep under so many
lids.
Rilke and Mallarmé
If we wanted to isolate the characteristic feature of Rilke's experience, the one which his poetry
conserves above and beyond the images and forms, we would have to look for it in a particular
relation to the negative: in the tension which is a consent, the patience which obeys but which
nevertheless goes beyond ("He obeys by going beyond"), in the slow and practically invisible
action without efficacy but not without authority, which he opposes to the active force of the
world and which, in song, is secret attentiveness to death.
Rilke, like Mallarmé, makes poetry a relation to absence. How different, however, are the
experiences of these two poets, apparently so close; how different the demands that occupied
them within the same experience. While for Mallarmé absence remains the force of the negative
-- that which removes "the reality of things" and delivers us from their weight -- for Rilke
absence is also the presence of things, the intimacy of the being-a-thing where the desire to fall
toward the center in a silent, immobile, endless fall is gathered. Mallarmé's poetry pronounces
being with the brilliance of that which has the power to annihilate, to suspend beings and
suspend itself by withdrawing into the dazzling vivacity of an instant. This poetry retains the
decisiveness that makes of absence something active, of death an act and of voluntary death --
where nothingness is entirely within our mastery -- the poetic event par excellence, brought to
light by the Igitur experiment. But Rilke, who also turns toward death as toward the origin of 
poetic possibility, seeks a deeper relation with death. He sees in voluntary death still only the
symbol of a violent power and a spirit of strength upon which poetic truth cannot be founded. He
sees there an offense against death itself, a failing with respect to its discreet essence and to the
patience of its invisible force.
Absence is linked, in Mallarmé, to the suddenness of the instant. For an instant, at the moment
when everything falls back into nothingness, the purity of being gleams. For an instant, universal
absence becomes pure presence; and when everything disappears, disappearance appears. This is
pure clarity apparent, the unique point

where light is darkness shining, and it is day by night. Absence in Rilke is linked to the space
which is itself perhaps freed from time, but which nonetheless, through the slow transmutation
that consecrates it, is also like another time, a way of approaching a time which would be the
very time of dying or the essence of death, a time very different from the impatient and violent
agitation which is ours, as different as poetry's ineffectual action is from effective action.
In these times, when in the restlessness of the interminable and the stagnation of endless error we
have to dwell outside of ourselves, outside of the world, and, it would seem, even die outside of
death, Rilke wants to acknowledge a supreme possibility, one more movement, the approach to
grace, to the poetic opening: a relation with the Open that is happy at last, the liberation of the
Orphic word in which space is affirmed, space which is a "Nowhere without no." Then to speak
is a glorious transparency. To speak is no longer to tell or to name. To speak is to celebrate, and
to celebrate is to praise, to make of the word a pure radiant consumption which still speaks when
there is no more to say, does not name what is nameless but welcomes it, invokes and glorifies it.
This is the only language where night and silence are manifest without being interrupted or
revealed:
O tell me, poet, what you do. -- I praise.
But the mortal and monstrous,
how do you endure it, welcome it? -- I praise.
But the nameless, the anonymous,
how, poet, do you invoke it? -- I praise.
Where do you derive the right to be true
in all disguises, beneath every mask? -- I praise.
And how does silence know you, and furor,
as well as the star and the tempest? -- Because I praise.



V
Inspiration



The Outside, the Night
Whoever devotes himself to the work is drawn by it toward the point where it undergoes
impossibility. This experience is purely nocturnal, it is the very experience of night.
In the night, everything has disappeared. This is the first night. Here absence approaches --
silence, repose, night. Here death blots out Alexander's picture; here the sleeper does not know
he sleeps, and he who dies goes to meet real dying. Here language completes and fulfills itself in
the silent profundity which vouches for it as its meaning.
But when everything has disappeared in the night, "everything has disappeared" appears. This is
the other night. Night is this apparition: "everything has disappeared." It is what we sense when
dreams replace sleep, when the dead pass into the deep of the night, when night's deep appears in
those who have disappeared. Apparitions, phantoms, and dreams are an allusion to this empty
night. It is the night of Young, where the dark does not seem dark enough, or death ever dead
enough. What appears in the night is the night that appears. And this eeriness does not simply
come from something invisible, which would reveal itself under cover of dark and at the
shadows' summons. Here the invisible is what one cannot cease to see; it is the incessant making
itself seen. The "phantom" is meant to hide, to appease the phantom night. Those who think they
see ghosts are those who do not want to see the night. They crowd it with the terror of little
images, they occupy and distract it by immobilizing it -- stopping the oscillation of eternal
starting over. It is empty, it is not; but we dress it up as a kind of being; we enclose it, if possible,
in a name, a story and a resemblance; we say, like Rilke at Duino, "It is Raimondine and
Polyxène."
The first night is welcoming. Novalis addresses hymns to it. Of it one can say, In the night, as if
it had an intimacy. We enter into the night and we rest there, sleeping and dying.

But the other night does not welcome, does not open. In it one is still outside. It does not close
either; it is not the great Castle, near but unapproachable, impenetrable because the door is
guarded. Night is inaccessible because to have access to it is to accede to the outside, to remain
outside the night and to lose forever the possibility of emerging from it.
This night is never pure night. It is essentially impure. It is not that beautiful diamond, the void,
which Mallarmé contemplates, a poetic sky beyond the sky. It is not true night, it is night without
truth, which does not lie, however -- which is not false. It is not our bewilderment when our
senses deceive us. It is no mystery, but it cannot be demystified.
In the night one can die; we reach oblivion. But this other night is the death no one dies, the
forgetfulness which gets forgotten. In the heart of oblivion it is memory without rest.
To Lie Down upon Nikita 
In the night, to die, like to sleep, 1
is one more of the world's present moments, another of day's
resources. It is the admirable last stroke which completes, the culminating moment, perfection.
Every man seeks to die in the world, wishes to die of the world and for its sake. In this
perspective, dying means setting forth to meet the freedom which frees me from being, that
decisive separation which permits me to escape from being by pitting action, labor, and struggle
against it -- and thus permits me to move beyond myself toward the world of others. 2
I am, only
because I have made nothingness my power: only because I am able not to be. Dying, then,
marks the defining limit of this power; it is the grasp of this nothingness and, with this
understanding, the affirmation that others come toward me through death. It is also the
affirmation that freedom leads to death, sustains me even in death, makes of death my freely
chosen death. It is as if I confused myself, in the end, with the world's ultimate finish. To die is
thus to embrace the whole of time and to make of time a whole. It is a temporal ecstasy. One
never dies now, one always dies later, in the future -- in a future which is never

1
See, in the Appendixes, a few pages entitled "Sleep, night."
2At least this is the case if others form a whole, a possible totality. If the whole, though, is no
whole at all, the movement that goes from me toward others never comes back toward me. It
remains the circle's broken call. Moreover, the movement does not even go from me toward
others; no one answers me, because I do not call, because from "me" nothing originates.

an actuality, which cannot come except when everything will be over and done. And when
everything is over, there will be no more present: the future will again be past. This leap by
which the past catches up with the future, overstepping the present, is the sense of human death,
death permeated with humanity.
This point of view is not simply one of hope's illusions; it is implicit in our life, and it is, so to
speak, the truth of our death, at least of this first death which we find in the night. We want to die
of this negation which operates in productive operations, which is the silence of our words and
gives meaning to our voice, which makes of the world the future, the culmination of the world.
Man dies alone, perhaps, but the solitude of his death is very different from the solitude of a
person who lives alone. It is strangely prophetic. It is (in a sense) the solitude of a being who
belongs, not to the past at all, but entirely to the future, who ceases to be in order to become
solely he who will be, outside present limits and possibilities. He dies alone because he does not
die now, where we are, but altogether in the future and at the extreme reach of the future,
disengaged not only from his present existence but also from his present death. He dies alone
because he dies as everyone; and this too makes for great solitude. From this we also see why
death rarely seems to be achieved. To those who remain and surround the dying person, death
comes as a death to be died still more. And it rests with them: they must preserve and prolong it
until the moment when, time being at an end, everyone will die joyfully together. In this sense
everyone is in agony till the end of the world.
Brekhounov, the rich merchant who has always succeeded in life, cannot believe that a man such
as he should have to die all of a sudden simply because one evening he gets lost in the Russian
snow. "It cannot be." He mounts his horse, abandons the sledge and his servant Nikita, who is
already three-fourths frozen. He is decisive and enterprising, as always: he goes ahead. But
already this activity is active no longer. He walks at random, and his step goes nowhere. It is the 
meandering false step which, like a labyrinth, draws him into the space where every move ahead
is also a move back. Or he turns in circles, he obeys the fatality of the circle. Having set out at
random, so he returns "at random," as far as the sledge, where the scantily clad Nikita, who for
his part goes to no such lengths just to die, is sinking into the frigid cold of death. "Brekhounov,"
Tolstoy recounts, "paused for a few moments in silence; then, suddenly, with the same resolution
with which he used to strike hands when making a good purchase, he took a step back and,
turning

up his sleeves, began raking the snow off Nikita and out of the sledge." Apparently nothing has
changed: he is still the active merchant, decisive and enterprising, who always finds something to
do and always succeeds in everything. "That's our way," says this man, pleased with himself.
Yes, he is always the best, and he belongs to the class of the best men; he is alive and healthy.
But at that instant something happens. While his hand moves upon the cold body, something
breaks. What he is doing breaks the limits, is no longer what takes place here and now.
To his great surprise he could say no more, for tears came to his eyes and his lower jaw began to
quiver rapidly. He stopped speaking and only gulped down the risings in his throat. "Seems I was
badly frightened and have gone quite weak," he thought. But this weakness was not only
unpleasant, but gave him a peculiar joy such as he had never felt before. 3
Later he was found dead, lying upon Nikita and embracing him tightly.
In this perspective to die is always to seek to lie down upon Nikita, to stretch oneself out upon
the whole world of Nikitas, to embrace all other men and all of time. What is still represented to
us here as a virtuous conversion, an opening of the soul and a great fraternal emotion, is not any
of these things, however, not even for Tolstoy. To die is not to become a good master, or even
one's own servant; it is not a moral advance. The death of Brekhounov tells us nothing "good,"
and his gesture -- the movement which makes him lie down all at once upon a frozen body --
says nothing either. It is simple and natural; it is not human, but inevitable. This is what had to
happen. He could no more escape it than he could avoid dying. To lie down upon Nikita: this is
the incomprehensible and necessary movement that death wrings from us.
It is a nocturnal gesture. It does not belong to the category of habitual acts, it is not even an
inhabitual action. Nothing is accomplished by it. The intention that first made him act -- to warm
Nikita, to warm himself close to the sun of the Good -- has evaporated. The gesture is without
purpose, without significance; it has no reality. "He lies down to die." Brekhounov, the decisive,
enterprising man, even he can lie down only to die. It is death itself which all at once bends this
robust body and lays it down in the white night. And this night

does not frighten him; he does not refuse it or draw back from it. On the contrary, he hurries
joyfully to meet it. But, as he lies down in the night, it is, all the same, upon Nikita that he lies, as 
if this night were still the hope and future of a human form, as if we could not die except by
entrusting our death to someone else, to all the others, that it might await in them the icy depths
of the future.
Night as Trap
The first night is another of day's constructions. Day makes the night; it builds up its strong
points in the night. Night speaks only of day; it is the presentiment of day, day's reserve and its
profundity. Everything ends in the night; that is why there is day. Day is linked to night because
it would not be day if it did not begin and come to an end. That is the rule it goes by: it is
beginning and end. Day arises, day is done. That is what makes it indefatigable, industrious, and
creative; that is what makes day the incessant labor of the day. The more it expands, with the
proud aim of becoming universal, the more the nocturnal element threatens to withdraw into the
light itself: the more nocturnal is that which enlightens us, the more it is the uncertainty and
immensity of the night.
This is an essential risk. It is one of day's possible moves. There are several. It may, for example,
greet night as the edge of what is not to be ventured upon. Night, then, is accepted and
acknowledged, but only as a limit and as the necessity of a limit: we must not go beyond. So says
Greek moderation. Or, night is what day must finally dissolve: day works at its empire; it is its
own conquest and elaboration; it tends toward the unlimited, although in the accomplishment of
its tasks it only advances step by step and observes limit and barriers strictly. So says reason, the
triumph of enlightenment which simply banishes darkness. Or again, night is what day wants not
just to dissolve, but to appropriate: night is thus the essential, which must not be destroyed but
conserved, and welcomed not as a limit but for itself. Night must pass into day. Night becoming
day makes the light richer and gives to clarity's superficial sparkle a deep inner radiance. Then
day is the whole of the day and the night, the great promise of the dialectic.
When we oppose night and day and the movements accomplished in each, it is still to the night
of day that we allude, to the night that is day's night, the night of which we say that it is the true
night, for it has day's truth just as it has day's laws, those which, precisely, assign it the

duty of opposing itself to the day. Thus, for the Greeks, to submit to dark destiny is to assure
balance: moderation is respect for the immoderate and thus exacts respect from it. That is why it
is so necessary for the Greeks that the daughters of Night not be dishonored but that nonetheless
they have their domain and keep there, that they not be errant or elusive, but checked and held to
the oath of this restriction.
But the other night is always other. Only in the day does it seem comprehensible, ascertainable.
In the day it is the secret which could be disclosed; it is something concealed that awaits its
unveiling. Only the day can feel passion for the night. It is only in the day that death can be
desired, planned, decided upon -- reached. It is only in the day that the other night is revealed as
love that breaks all ties, that wants the end and union with the abyss. But in the night it is what
one never joins; it is repetition that will not leave off, satiety that has nothing, the sparkle of
something baseless and without depth. 
The trap, the other night, is the first night which we can penetrate, which we enter -- granted,
with anguish, and yet here anguish secludes us and insecurity becomes a shelter. In the first night
it seems that we will go -- by going further ahead -- toward something essential. And this is
correct, to the extent that the first night still belongs to the world and, through the world, to day's
truth. To advance in this first night is not an easy movement though. It is evoked by the labors of
Kafka beast in The Burrow. There you assure yourself of solid defenses against the world above,
but leave yourself open to the insecurity of the underneath. You build after day's fashion, but
below ground, and what rises sinks, what is erected is swallowed up. The more the burrow seems
solidly closed to the outside, the greater the danger that you be closed in with the outside,
delivered to the peril without any means of escape. And when every foreign threat seems shut
out of this perfectly closed intimacy, then it is intimacy that becomes menacing foreignness.
Then the essence of danger is at hand.
There is always a moment when, in the night, the beast hears the other beast. This is the other
night. And this is in no way terrifying; it says nothing extraordinary, it has nothing in common
with ghosts and trances. It is only muffled whispering, a noise one can hardly distinguish from
silence, the seeping sands of silence. Not even that. Only the sound of some activity, some
foraging or burrowing -- at first intermittent, but once perceived it won't go away. Kafka's story
has no end. The last sentence opens onto this unending movement: "Everything continued
without any change." One of the publishers adds that only a

few pages are missing, those which describe the decisive combat in which the hero of the
narrative was to succumb. This is a rather poor reading. There could be no decisive combat. Such
a combat admits of no decision, of no fight either, but only of a wait, an approach, suspicions,
the vicissitudes of an always more threatening threat. But this threat is infinite, it is indecisive; it
is contained entirely in its very inv decision. What the beast senses in the distance -- that
monstrous thing which eternally approaches it and works eternally at coming closer -- is itself.
And if the beast could ever come into this thing's presence, what it would encounter would be its
own absence: itself, but itself become the other, which it would not recognize, which it would
not meet. The other night is always the other, and he who senses it becomes the other. He who
approaches it departs from himself, is no longer he who approaches but he who turns away, goes
hither and yon. He who, having entered the first night, seeks intrepidly to go toward its
profoundest intimacy, toward the essential, hears at a certain moment the other night -- hears
himself, hears the eternally reverberating echo of his own step, a step toward silence, toward the
void. But the echo sends this step back to him as the whispering immensity, and the void is now
a presence coming toward him.
Whoever senses the approach of the other night has the impression that he is approaching the
heart of the night, the essential night which he seeks. And no doubt it is "at that moment" that he
gives himself up to the inessential and loses all possibility. Thus it is that moment which he must
avoid, just as the traveler is advised to avoid the point where the desert becomes seductive
mirage. But such prudence is useless here. There is no exact moment at which one would pass
from night to the other night, no limit at which to stop and come back in the other direction.
Midnight never falls at midnight. Midnight falls when the dice are cast, but they cannot be cast
till Midnight. 
Therefore one must turn away from the first night. That at least is possible. One must live in the
day and labor for its sake. Yes, one has to do that. But to labor for the day is to find, in the end,
the night; it is thus to make night the job of the day, to make night a task and an abode. It is to
construct the burrow. And to construct the burrow is to open night to the other night.
The risk of surrendering to the inessential is itself essential. To flee it is to be pursued by it. It
becomes the shadow which always follows you and always precedes you. To seek it
methodically is also to misconstrue it. Not to know of it makes life easier and tasks more
feasible,

but in ignorance it still lies concealed; forgetfulness is the depth of its remembrance. And
whoever senses it can no longer escape. Whoever has approached it, even if he has recognized in
it the risk of the inessential, regards this approach as essential, sacrifices to it all of truth, all the
important concerns to which he nevertheless still feels attached.
Why is this? Is it the power of error? Is it night's fascination? But it has no power, it does not
call, it attracts only by negligence. Whoever believes he is attracted finds himself profoundly
neglected. Whoever claims to be in the thrall of an irresistible vocation, is only dominated by his
own weakness. He calls irresistible the fact that there is nothing to resist; he calls vocation that
which does not call him, and he has to shoulder his nothingness for a yoke. Why is this? Why do
some embark upon works in order to escape this risk -- to elude rather than respond to
"inspiration," constructing their work as a burrow where they want to think they are sheltered
from the void and which they only build, precisely, by hollowing and deepening the void,
creating a void all around them? Why do others, so many others, knowing that they betray the
world and the truth of purposeful activities, have only one concern: to deceive themselves by
imagining that they still serve the world in which they only seek refuge and assurance? In this
way they no longer betray only the movement of true endeavors; with their bad conscience --
which they assuage with honors, services, with the feeling of accomplishing all the while a
mission, of being guardians of culture, the oracles of a people -- they are traitors to the error of
their idleness. And perhaps others neglect even to construct the burrow, for fear that by
protecting them this shelter would protect in them that which they must surrender, would bolster
their presence too much and thus avert the approach of that point of uncertainty toward which
they slip, "the decisive combat" with indecision. No one hears tell of these. They leave no
account of their journey, they have no name, they are anonymous in the anonymous crowd
because they do not distinguish themselves, because they have entered into the realm of the
indistinct.
Why? Why this move? Why this hopeless movement toward what is without importance?

Orpheus's Gaze
When Orpheus descends toward Eurydice, art is the power by which night opens. Because of
art's strength, night welcomes him; it becomes welcoming intimacy, the harmony and accord of
the first night. But it is toward Eurydice that Orpheus has descended. For him Eurydice is the
furthest that art can reach. Under a name that hides her and a veil that covers her, she is the 
profoundly obscure point toward which art and desire, death and night, seem to tend. She is the
instant when the essence of night approaches as the other night.
However, Orpheus's work does not consist in ensuring this point's approach by descending into
the depths. His work is to bring it back to the light of day and to give it form, shape, and reality
in the day. Orpheus is capable of everything, except of looking this point in the face, except of
looking at the center of night in the night. He can descend toward it; he can -- and this is still
stronger an ability -- draw it to him and lead it with him upward, but only by turning away from
it. This turning away is the only way it can be approached. This is what concealment means
when it reveals itself in the night. But Orpheus, in the movement of his migration, forgets the
work he is to achieve, and he forgets it necessarily, for the ultimate demand which his movement
makes is not that there be a work, but that someone face this point, grasp its essence, grasp it
where it appears, where it is essential and essentially appearance: at the heart of night.
The Greek myth says: a work can be produced only if the measureless experience of the deep --
which the Greeks recognized as necessary to the work and where the work endures its
measurelessness -- is not pursued for its own sake. The deep does not reveal itself directly; it is
only disclosed hidden in the work. This is an essential, an inexorable

answer. But the myth shows nonetheless that Orpheus's destiny is not to submit to this ultimate
law. And, of course, by turning toward Eurydice, Orpheus ruins the work, which is immediately
undone, and Eurydice returns among the shades. When he looks back, the essence of night is
revealed as the inessential. Thus he betrays the work, and Eurydice, and the night. But not to turn
toward Eurydice would be no less untrue. Not to look would be infidelity to the measureless,
imprudent force of his movement, which does not want Eurydice in her daytime truth and her
everyday appeal, but wants her in her nocturnal obscurity, in her distance, with her closed body
and sealed face -- wants to see her not when she is visible, but when she is invisible, and not as
the intimacy of a familiar life, but as the foreignness of what excludes all intimacy, and wants,
not to make her live, but to have living in her the plenitude of her death.
That alone is what Orpheus came to seek in the Underworld. All the glory of his work, all the
power of his art, and even the desire for a happy life in the lovely, clear light of day are
sacrificed to this sole aim: to look in the night at what night hides, the other night, the
dissimulation that appears.
This is an infinitely problematic movement, which day condemns as a form of unjustifiable
madness, or as exonerating immoderation. From day's perspective, the descent into the
Underworld, the movement down into vain depths, is in itself excessive. It is inevitable that
Orpheus transgress the law which forbids him to "turn back," for he already violated it with his
first steps toward the shades. This remark implies that Orpheus has in fact never ceased to be
turned toward Eurydice: he saw her invisible, he touched her intact, in her shadowy absence, in
that veiled presence which did not hide her absence, which was the presence of her infinite
absence. Had he not looked at her, he would not have drawn her toward him; and doubtless she is
not there, but in this glance back he himself is absent. He is no less dead than she -- dead, not of
that tranquil worldly death which is rest, silence, and end, but of that other death which is death
without end, the ordeal of the end's absence. 
Day, judging Orpheus's undertaking, also reproaches him with having proved impatient.
Orpheus's error seems then to lie in the desire which moves him to see and to possess Eurydice,
he whose destiny is only to sing of her. He is Orpheus only in the song: he cannot have any
relation to Eurydice except within the hymn. He has life and truth only after the poem and
because of it, and Eurydice represents nothing other

than this magic dependence which outside the song makes him a shade and renders him free,
alive, and sovereign only in the Orphic space, according to Orphic measure. Yes, this is true:
only in the song does Orpheus have power over Eurydice. But in the song too, Eurydice is
already lost, and Orpheus himself is the dispersed Orpheus; the song immediately makes him
"infinitely dead." He loses Eurydice because he desires her beyond the measured limits of the
song, and he loses himself, but this desire, and Eurydice lost, and Orpheus dispersed are
necessary to the song, just as the ordeal of eternal inertia is necessary to the work.
Orpheus is guilty of impatience. His error is to want to exhaust the infinite, to put a term to the
interminable, not endlessly to sustain the very movement of his error. Impatience is the failing of
one who wants to withdraw from the absence of time; patience is the ruse which seeks to master
this absence by making of it another time, measured otherwise. But true patience does not
exclude impatience. It is intimacy with impatience -- impatience suffered and endured endlessly.
Orpheus's impatience is thus at the same time a proper movement: in it begins what will become
his own passion, his highest patience, his infinite sojourn in death.
Inspiration
If the world judges Orpheus, the work does not. It sheds no light on his faults. The work says
nothing. And everything proceeds as if, by disobeying the law, by looking at Eurydice, Orpheus
had only obeyed the deep demand of the work -- as if, by this inspired movement, he had indeed
captured from Hell the obscure shade and had, unknowingly, led it back into the broad daylight
of the work.
To look at Eurydice, without regard for the song, in the impatience and imprudence of desire
which forgets the law: that is inspiration. Would inspiration, then, transform night's beauty into
the unreality of the void? Would it make Eurydice a shade and render Orpheus "infinitely dead"?
Is inspiration, then, that critical moment when the essence of night becomes the inessential, and
the first night's welcoming intimacy becomes the deceptive trap, the other night? We cannot say
otherwise. From inspiration we sense only failure, we recognize only confused violence. But if
inspiration pronounces Orpheus's failure and declares Eurydice lost twice over -- if it expresses
the insignificance and the void of the night -- it turns Orpheus and it propels him toward that
failure and that insignificance irresistibly, as if to renounce failure were

much graver than to renounce success, as if what we call the insignificant, the inessential, error,
could, to one who accepts the risk and surrenders to it without restraint, reveal itself as the source
of all authenticity.
The inspired and forbidden gaze destines Orpheus to lose everything: not only himself, not only
day's reality; but night's essence. This is certain, unexceptionable. Inspiration pronounces 
Orpheus's ruin and the certainty of his ruin, and it does not promise, as compensation, the work's
success any more than it affirms in the work the ideal triumph of Orpheus or the survival of
Eurydice. The work, through inspiration, is no less compromised than Orpheus is threatened. It
reaches, in that instant, its point of extreme uncertainty. That is why it resists so often and so
strongly that which inspires it. That is also why it protects itself by saying to Orpheus: You will
keep me only if you keep from looking at her. But that forbidden movement is precisely what
Orpheus must accomplish in order to carry the work beyond what assures it. It is what he cannot
accomplish except by forgetting the work, seduced by a desire that comes to him from the night,
and that is linked to night as to its origin. In this gaze, the work is lost. This look is the only
moment in which the work is lost absolutely. Something more important than the work, more
bereft of importance than the work, announces and affirms itself. The work is everything to
Orpheus except that desired look where it is lost. Thus it is only in that look that the work can
surpass itself, be united with its origin and consecrated in impossibility.
Orpheus's gaze is Orpheus's ultimate gift to the work. It is a gift whereby he refuses, whereby he
sacrifices the work, bearing himself toward the origin according to desire's measureless
movement -- and whereby unknowingly he still moves toward the work, toward the origin of the
work.
Then for Orpheus everything collapses into the certainty of failure where there remains only, as
compensation, the work's uncertainty, for is there ever a work? Before the most convincing
masterpiece, where the brilliance and resolution of the beginning shine, it can also happen that
we confront something extinguished: a work suddenly become invisible again, which is no
longer there, has never been there. This sudden eclipse is the distant memory of Orpheus's gaze;
it is the nostalgic return to the uncertainty of the origin.

The Gift and the Sacrifice
Were we to insist upon what such a moment seems to say of inspiration, we would have to state:
it links inspiration to desire.
It introduces into concern for the work the movement of unconcern in which the work is
sacrificed: the work's ultimate law is broken; the work is betrayed in favor of Eurydice, in favor
of the shade. Insouciance is the movement of sacrifice -- a sacrifice which can only be light and
insouciant. Perhaps it is sin. Indeed, it is immediately expiated as sin, but its substance is all
levity, unconcern, innocence. This is a sacrifice without ceremony, where the sacred itself, night
in its unapproachable profundity, is given back -- through the insouciant look which is not even a
sacrilege, which by no means has the weight or the gravity of a profanation -- to the inessential,
which is not the profane but less than any such category.
Granted, the essential night which, before his insouciant look, follows Orpheus -- the sacred
night which he captures in the song's fascination and which, then, is maintained within the song's
limits and its measured space -- this night is certainly richer, more august than the empty futility
which it becomes after he looks. The sacred night encloses Eurydice; it encloses within the song
what surpasses the song. But it is itself also enclosed. It is bound, it follows, it is the sacred
mastered by the force of rites, which is to say order, rectitude, law, the way of the Tao, and the
axis of the Dharma. The look of Orpheus unbinds it, breaks the limits, breaks the law that 
contained and that restrained essence. His gaze is thus the extreme moment of liberty, the
moment when he frees himself from himself and, still more important, frees the work from his
concern, frees the sacred contained in the work, gives the sacred to itself, to the freedom of its
essence, to its essence which is freedom. (This is why inspiration is the gift par excellence.)
Everything is risked, then, in the decision to look. It is in this decision that the origin is
approached by the force of the gaze that unbinds night's essence, lifts concern, interrupts the
incessant by discovering it. This is a moment of desire, of insouciance and of authority.
Orpheus's look links inspiration to desire. Impatience links desire to insouciance. Whoever is not
impatient will never come to insouciance, to the instant when concern is united with its own
transparency.

But whoever is merely impatient will never be capable of the insouciant, weightless gaze of
Orpheus. That is why impatience must be the core of profound patience, the pure flash which an
infinite waiting, which the silence and reserve of this attention cause to spring from its center not
only as the spark which extreme tension ignites, but as the brilliant point which has escaped this
mindful wait -- the glad accident, insouciance.
The Leap
Writing begins with Orpheus's gaze. And this gaze is the movement of desire that shatters the
song's destiny, that disrupts concern for it, and in this inspired and careless decision reaches the
origin, consecrates the song. But in order to descend toward this instant, Orpheus has to possess
the power of art already. This is to say: one writes only if one reaches that instant which
nevertheless one can only approach in the space opened by the movement of writing. To write,
one has to write already. In this contradiction are situated the essence of writing, the snag in the
experience, and inspiration's leap.

Inspiration, Lack of Inspiration
The leap is inspiration's form or movement. This form or this movement makes inspiration
unjustifiable. But in this form or movement inspiration also comes into its own: its principal
characteristic is affirmed in this inspiration which is at the same time and from the same point of
view lack of inspiration -- creative force and aridity intimately confounded. Hölderlin undergoes
the rigors of this condition when he endures poetic time as the time of distress, when the gods are
lacking but where God's default helps us: Gottes Fehl hilft. Mallarmé, whom sterility tormented
and who shut himself into it with heroic resolve, also recognized that this deprivation did not
express a simple personal failing, did not signify that he was deprived of the work, but
announced his encounter with the work, the threatening intimacy of this encounter.
Automatic Writing
In our time -- and in a form which misunderstandings and facile interpretations have
impoverished but also preserved -- this essential aspect of inspiration was rediscovered by
surrealism. André Breton sustained it by persevering in his affirmation of automatic writing's
value. What did this discovery contribute? Apparently the opposite of what it signified: an easy
method, an instrument always at hand and always effective, poetry brought well within 
everyone's reach, the glad presence, after all, of the immediate. Anybody at all was immediately
a perfect poet. Better still, the poem, unwavering and absolute, passed from being to being and
wrote itself all by itself in each.
So it seemed: an attractive myth in any event, which was well worth investigating. But in reality,
where the most facile means were being proposed, there hid behind this facility an extreme
demand; and

behind this certitude -- this gift offered to everyone and disclosed in each without regard to talent
or degree of culture -- was concealed the insecurity of the inaccessible, the infinite experience of
that which cannot even be sought, a probing of what never is in evidence, the exacting demands
of a search which is no search at all and of a presence which is never granted. Nothing is closer
to us, it seems, than the poetry of automatic writing, since it turns us toward the immediate. But
the immediate is not close; it is not close to what is close to us. It staggers us; it is, just as
Hölderlin said, the terrible upheaval.
In the Entretiens, Breton stresses the difficulty of such a spontaneity.
On this occasion I won't abstain, in passing, from dealing with the accusation of laziness which
is periodically brought against those who devote or have devoted themselves with more or less
perseverance to writing or to any other form of automatic activity. In order to be truly automatic,
this writing must in effect have succeeded in placing itself in a condition of detachment with
respect to the solicitations of the exterior world as well as with respect to individual
preoccupations of a utilitarian, or sentimental, or other similar order. It still seems to me today
incomparably more simple, less troubling, to satisfy the demands of reflective thought than to
make this thought utterly available, so that one no longer has an ear for anything except what the
shadow mouth says.

It is natural that what was initially apparent in this conjunction of poetry and unreflective writing
was the decision to escape constraints. Reason supervises us, the critical intellect restrains us, we
speak according to customs and conventions. Automatic writing reveals to us a way of writing
apart from these powers, in the daylight but as if outside the day in a nocturnal fashion, free from
the everyday and from its inhibiting scrutiny. Hence the fact that in the history of surrealism the
freedoms of writing are linked to "sleep experiences," and are like calmer, less hazardous
versions of these. Each of Breton's friends sought night naïvely in a premeditated sleep; each
slipped out of his customary self and believed himself freer, master of a greater space. This
produced disorders which had to be stopped for "considerations of elementary mental hygiene."
It might be said that prudence is out of place here. But imprudence did not lead very far. It led
Desnos, for example, not to lose himself, not to wander astray, far from himself, but, Breton said,
"to want to concentrate attention upon himself."

Entretiens, 1913-1952.

Automatic writing tended to suppress constraints, suspend intermediaries, reject all mediation. It
put the hand that writes in contact with something original; it made of this active hand a 
sovereign passivity, no longer a means of livelihood, an instrument, a servile tool, but an
independent power, over which no one had authority any more, which belonged to no one and
which could not, which knew not how to do anything -- but write: a dead hand analogous to that
hand of glory which magic speaks of (magic whose error lay, precisely, in wanting to make use
of it).
This hand seems to put the depths of language at our command. But in reality, we cannot use this
language at all, any more than we can use this hand, which is as foreign to us as if it had forsaken
us or as if it were drawing us into the very milieu of forsakenness, where there are no more
resources, where there is no more support, no more grasp or limit.
This is what automatic writing initially reminds us: the language whose approach it ensures is
not a power -- is not power to speak. In it I can do nothing and "I" never speak.
And yet, is it not a stroke of good fortune as well? Does it not also guarantee us the freedom to
say all? Does it not establish the artist as if at the center of everything and exempt him from the
judgments of the other powers -- aesthetic, moral, or legal? The artist seems to bear no
responsibility for a limitless passion which opens him to all and reveals all to him. Everywhere is
his country, and everything his affair; and he has the right to see into everything. This is
attractive and overwhelming.
The right not to choose is a privilege, but an exhausting one. The right not to choose is also the
refusal to choose, the duty not to consent to any choice, the necessity to elude the choices which
the natural order of the world -- which is the order we live in -- proposes to us (or which any
order expressed by a law, transcendent or immanent, proposes to us). It is not, moreover, a
matter of refusing to choose in a sort of moral decision, through an inverse ascetic discipline, but
rather of reaching the moment where it is no longer possible to choose. It is a matter of reaching
the point where to speak is to say all and where the poet becomes the one who cannot withdraw
from anything, who turns away from nothing, but is yielded up, without any protection whatever,
to the foreignness and the measureless excess of being.
Automatic writing, then, in which people have generally been content to discern the invention of
a very particular diversion, does nothing other than give form to the initial poetic demand: the
one by which we have seen Rilke infinitely tormented, the one which Hugo

von Hofmannsthal, seeking to return to poetry the keys of its kingdom, is also led to express
when, in his 1907 essay, The Poet and These Times, he says of the inspired person:
He is there, silently changing places, nothing but eye, but ear, and receiving his color only from
the things upon which he alights. He is a spectator; no, he is the hidden companion, the silent
brother of all things, and the change of his colors is an intimate torment for him, for he suffers
from all things, and he delights in them at the same time that he suffers. This power of painful
joy is the whole content of his life. He suffers from feeling things so much, he suffers from each
and from all together, he suffers from their singularity and from the coherence that unites them,
he suffers from what is elevated in them, valueless, sublime, vulgar; he suffers from their moods
and their thoughts . . . . He cannot neglect anything. Upon no being, no thing, no phantom --
upon no phantasm born of human brain has he permission to close his eyes. It is as if his eyes 
had no lids. He hasn't the right to banish any of the thoughts that press upon him by claiming that
he belongs to another order, for, in the order which is his, each thing must find its place. In him
everything must and everything wants to meet . . . . Such is the unique law to which he submits:
not to forbid a single thing access to his soul. 5
And Hofmannsthal alludes to the other aspect of inspiration which we are attempting to show --
its not lacking when it lacks, but its expressing, in this lack as well, the profundity, the profusion
and the mystery of its presence:
It is not that the poet thinks ceaselessly of all the things in the world; they think of him. They are
in him, they dominate him.

5
In a letter, Keats expresses himself in almost the same way: "As to the poetical Character
itself (I mean that sort of which, if I am anything, I am a Member . . . ): it is not itself -- it has
no self -- it is everything and nothing -- It has no character -- it enjoys light and shade; it lives
in gusto, be it foul or fair, high or low, rich or poor, mean or elevated. . . . A Poet is the most
unpoetical of any thing in existence; because he has no Identity -- he is continuingly in for --
and filling some other body -- The Sun, the Moon, the Sea, and Men and Women, who are
creatures of impulse, are poetical, and have about them an unchangeable attribute -- the poet
has none; no identity -- he is certainly the most unpoetical of all God's Creatures. If, then, he
has no self, and if I am a Poet, where is the Wonder that I should say I would write no more?"
[From The Letters of John Keats, ed. Hyder Edward Rolling ( Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard
Univ. Press, 1958), 1: 386-387 -- Trans.]

Even his arid hours, his depressions, his dismay are impersonal moods; they correspond to the
jags on a seismograph, and a profound enough gaze could read in them secrets still more
mysterious than in the poems themselves.
The Murmur's Inexhaustibility
When the poet is told, as André Breton put it sumptuously in The First Manifesto: "Keep on as
much as you like. Trust in the murmur's inexhaustibility," it seems that only the infinite wealth of
poetic inspiration is thereby conveyed to us. Inspiration's primary characteristic is to be
inexhaustible, for it is the approach of the uninterrupted. Whoever is inspired -- whoever thinks
he is -- has the feeling that he is going to speak forever, write forever. Rilke remarks that when
he was writing The Book of Hours, he felt as though he could no longer stop writing. And Van
Gogh says he cannot stop working. Yes, it is endless, it speaks, it does not cease speaking, a
language with no silence, for in it silence is spoken. Automatic writing is the affirmation of this
language without silence, of this infinite murmur opened near us, underneath our common
utterances, which seems an eternal spring. To the writer it says: I give you the key to all words.
A marvelous promise, which each writer hastens to interpret as if what was said were: All words
will be yours. But it is still more than that which is promised him: not only the whole of
language, but language as origin, the pure springing of the origin, where speaking precedes not
one of another utterance but its possibility -- where speaking always precedes itself.
The ambiguity of this movement lies in the fact that at first the point toward which inspiration or
automatic writing turns us -- this language all gathered up together to which we have access, 
which opens an access for itself through us by annihilating us, by changing us into no one -- at
first this language does not seem to be one with which nothing can be done. It seems, on the
contrary, that if you maintain contact with it, everything will be able to be said and that
everything said will partake of the purity of the origin. It seems possible to be both he who
manipulates everyday words -- with more or less talent, more or fewer resources -- and he who
touches that moment of language when it is not manipulable, when what approaches is the
neutral, indistinct word which is speaking's being, the idled word with which nothing can be
done. And because the writer thinks he remains both one and the

other -- both the man who manipulates words and the place where the unmanipulable which
language is escapes every division and is pure indeterminacy -- the illusion comes over him that
he can manipulate the unmanipulable and in this original speech say everything and give voice
and expression to everything.
But is it an illusion? If it is, it holds sway, not like a mirage which would afford the poet an
effortless vision, but like a temptation which entices him off the sure roads and leads him toward
the most difficult and the most remote. Then inspiration appears little by little in its true light: it
is powerful, but on the condition that he who welcomes it become very weak. It has no need of
the world's resources, or of personal talent, but one has therefore to have renounced these
resources, to have no longer any means of support in the world and to be free of oneself. It is,
they say, magic; it works instantly, without time's long approaches, without intermediary. That is
to say: one has to waste time, surrender the right to act and the power to produce.
The purer the inspiration, the more dispossessed is he who enters the space where it draws him,
where he hears the origin's closer call. It is as if the wealth he comes into, that superabundance of
the source, were also extreme poverty, were indeed refusal's superabundance, and made of him
the one who does not produce, who wanders astray within an infinite idleness. Common sense is
wrong, then, to think that the arid state to which the most inspired of artists are a prey means that
inspiration -- this grace which is given and taken away -- suddenly fails them. One ought rather
say that there is a point where inspiration and the lack of inspiration are confounded, an extreme
point where inspiration, this movement outside of tasks, of acquired forms and proven
expressions, takes the name aridity and becomes the absence of power, the impossibility which
the artist questions in vain, which is a nocturnal state, at once marvelous and desperate. There he
lingers, in search of an errant word -- he who has not been able to resist the excessively pure
force of inspiration.
Lord Chandos
In Lord Chandos's Letter, Hugo von Hofmannsthal described this standstill, this state of
suspense when inspiration has the same countenance as sterility, when it is the enchantment that
immobilizes words and banishes thoughts. Lord Chandos tries to convey to Francis

Bacon why he has renounced all literary preoccupations. "I have," he explains, "completely lost
the ability to treat coherently, by thought or word, any subject whatever." Before the most
general and the most lofty words, he feels an uneasiness: not a simple doubt about their value or 
a hesitation as to their legitimacy, but the impression of a reality coming apart, of a thing rotting
and crumbling into dust. It is not that he lacks words, but that they are transformed before his
eyes. They cease to be signs and become gazes, an empty light, attractive and fascinating. They
are no longer words but the being of words, that fundamental passivity with which automatic
writing seeks to put us in contact. "Isolated words swam around me; they congealed and became
eyes fixed on me. And I in my turn was forced to stare at them. They were whirlpools, dizzying
when the gaze plunged into them, which turned ceaselessly, and beyond them was the void." At
the same time, Lord Chandos describes another aspect of this transformation: words lose all
coherence, objects become useless, but, in the shelter of this lack, a new contact forms with
things' intimacy, a presentiment of unknown relations, of another language, capable of
expressing the infinite acceptance which the poet is when he becomes the refusal to choose --
capable also of enclosing the silence that lies in the deepest recesses of things. Hofmannsthal
gives this experience the slightly flaccid character of his harmonious melancholy, but he finds at
least one striking expression to communicate the demand from which no artist can escape. This
demand assigns to the artist -- to the most irresponsible of men -- the responsibility for what he
cannot accomplish, and makes him guilty for what he cannot say, for what cannot be said.
Hofmannsthal writes:
At that moment I felt, with a certainty which did not cease to hurt, that neither next year, nor the
next after that nor in any year of my life will I write any book, either in Latin or in English, for a
strange and painful reason . . . . I mean that the language in which it might have been given me
not only to write but to think is neither Latin nor English, nor Italian nor Spanish, but a language
of which I know not a word. It is the language which mute things speak to me and in which I will
perhaps one day, from the depths of the tomb, have to justify myself before an unknown judge.
Max Brod reports that Kafka read Lord Chandos's Letter as a kindred text. And certainly Kafka,
when he wrote, felt judged from deep down in his words by that unknown tongue of which he
was not the

master, but for which he was responsible, and which, with torments and preposterous
accusations, removed him more and more from the authority to write -- separated him from that
gay and somewhat mannered talent which was his at first -- and condemned him to a language
whose understanding was refused him but whose justification was required of him. We are
drawn, by too strong a movement, into a space where truth lacks, where limits have disappeared,
where we are delivered to the immeasurable. And yet it is there that we are required to maintain
an even step, not to lose a sense of proportion and to seek a true language by going all the way
down into the deep of error.
One has to defend against this movement if one wants nevertheless to produce. It is as if one
couldn't escape sterility except by escaping the omnipotence of inspiration, as if one couldn't
write except -- since one must write -- by resisting the pure need to write, by avoiding the
approach of what is to be written, that word without beginning or end which we cannot express
except by silencing it. This is the magic torment which is linked to the call of inspiration. One
necessarily betrays it: and not because books are only the degraded echo of a sublime word, but
because one only writes them by silencing what inspires them, by failing the movement they
claim to recall, by interrupting "the murmur." 
Whoever wants to write and to produce has ceaselessly to put this exaltation to sleep within
himself. Mastery presupposes this sleep by which the creator pacifies and deceives the power
that leads him on. He is creative and capable, according to the capability which leaves its trace
upon the world, only because he has placed between his activity and the center from which
shines the original word, the interval, the thickness of sleep. His lucidity is made of this sleep.
One would be deceived, then, about surrealist experiments, and these would deceive us about the
place where inspiration is situated, if they invited us to see in inspiration an event like sleep. In
fact one sleeps, in a way, to evade it. Kafka repeatedly says to Gustav Janouch, "If it weren't for
these terrible nights of insomnia, in general I wouldn't write." He must be understood
profoundly: inspiration, that errant word which cannot come to an end, is the long night of
insomnia. And it is in order to defend himself against it, by turning away from it, that the writer
actually comes to write. Writing is an activity that returns him to the world where he can sleep.
That is also why surrealism does not put its trust in sleep when it entrusts itself to the dream. If
there is a relation between "inspiration"

and dream, this is because the dream is an allusion to a refusal to sleep within sleep -- an allusion
to the impossibility of sleeping which sleep becomes in the dream. The adepts of the first
surrealist hypnoses believed they were abandoning themselves to sleep. Hypnosis, however,
consists not in putting to sleep, but in preventing sleep. It maintains within concentrated night a
passive, obedient light, the point of light which is unable to go out: paralyzed lucidity. The
power that fascinates has come into contact with this point, which it touches in the separated
place where everything becomes image. Inspiration pushes us gently or impetuously out of the
world, and in this outside there is no sleep, any more than there is rest. Perhaps it must be called
night, but night -- the essence of night -- does not, precisely, let us sleep. In it there is no refuge
to be found in sleep. Sleep is a way out through which we seek to escape, not the day, but the
night, from which there is no way out.
The Work: A Road toward Inspiration
The failures of automatic writing do not discourage André Breton. In his eyes they do not in the
least diminish the demand it represents. And if he continues to hope for an absolute success from
it, and even to ask of it something like a means toward its own purification, this hope is
analogous to the one which protects the artist when, wanting to produce a work, but not wanting
to betray what inspires it, he seeks to reconcile the irreconcilable and to find the work where he
must expose himself to the essential lack of work, the essential inertia. This is a harrowing
experience, which can be pursued only under the veil of failure. And yet, while the experience is
the infinitely hazardous movement which cannot succeed, we call what issues from it success.
This torment we call happiness, and this and poverty becomes the bountifulness of inspiration.
This laborious, this indefatigable despair is the sheer good fortune or the grace of a gift that
requires no effort. One artist tells us what all of them encounter within the experience: "My
paintings are valueless." "As a painter I will never amount to anything important, I feel this
absolutely." That is the truth of the experience. The artist must persevere in the realm of this
"valuelessness"; he has to maintain the will to achieve and the claim on perfection while
suffering the distress of an irredeemable failure. And yet for us this failure is called Van Gogh.
And this distress becomes a flaming torch, the very essence of color. 

The essential thing to be said about this experience is perhaps as follows: for a long time works
went through it, but unknowingly. Or they gave it a name that hid it. That was when art wanted
to make the gods present or to represent men. Today it is different. The work is no longer
innocent; it knows whence it comes. Or at least it knows how to seek, and in this seeking how to
approach always nearer to the origin, and in this approach how to keep without fail to the path
where possibility is gambled, where the risk is essential and failure threatens. This is what the
work seems to ask, this is where it pushes the artist: away from itself and from its realization.
This experience has become so grave that the artist pursues it endlessly. Despairing of success
yet at the same time concerned for the essential, he produces this experience in the broad
daylight. He seeks to express it directly or, in other words, to make of the work a road toward
inspiration -- that which protects and preserves the purity of inspiration -- and not of inspiration
a road toward the work.
It makes no difference that this process is logically erroneous. For it is precisely the necessity of
this error, the fact that it apparently precludes any outcome and that nonetheless it is the extreme
demand -- it is precisely this quality as requirement ruling out result -- which obliges the artist
not to turn away from it and mysteriously to sustain the inordinateness of it. But there is another
difficulty which puts him even more profoundly in the wrong. Rilke alludes to it in a letter to
Clara Rilke:
This shows you incontrovertibly that we must submit to the most extreme ordeals, but also, it
seems, that we are not to breathe a word about them before plunging into our work. We are not
to lessen them by communicating them. For the unique -- that which no one else would
understand or have the right to understand, that sort of disorder which is proper to us -- must
enter into our work to become valid and to reveal its law, which is an original design that only
the transparency of art renders visible . . . . I imagine sometimes what folly -- and what an error -
- Van Gogh would have committed if he had had to communicate to anyone at all the nature of
his vision, if he had had to consider with other people the motifs from which he was going to
extract his paintings.
Van Gogh's call to Gauguin is born of this desire for an immediate communication. Gauguin
comes. "Hardly was he there, the friend so much desired, his other self, than Van Gogh, from
despair, shaved off his ears."

Perhaps, in effect, the experience is wrecked from the instant it breaks with its intimacy and
seeks to reveal itself. Perhaps it seeks disclosure only in order to become bearable, to lighten and
"lessen" itself. To such a perhaps, each responds for himself alone: one cuts off his ear, but he
makes no painting of it; another wanders, makes disturbances in the streets -- and it is the
beginning of Aurelia, which ends under the snow, rue de la Vieille-Lanterne. It suffices to point
out here that automatic writing is another answer to this question. It says intrepidly: only the
moment of the experience counts; all that matters is the anonymous, visible trace of an absence
without reserve. Everything must become public. The secret must be violated. The dark must
enter into the day, it must dawn. What cannot be said must nevertheless be heard: Quidquid latet
apparebit. Everything hidden: that is what must appear. And not with the anxiety of a guilty 
conscience, but with the insouciance of happy lips. -- What, without risks or perils? With the
ease of a word that escapes, of an unconscious, ignorant liberty? Not without risks and never in
the calm of an indifferent spontaneity. Automatic writing is passive; this also means that it places
itself in the imprudence and the temerity of a movement of pure passion. It is the word become
desire, trusting to desire to bring it back to its source. And what it tirelessly affirms, what it
cannot silence, what it can neither begin nor finish expressing, is what René Char echoes when
he says, "The poem is the realized love of desire still desiring." And André Breton: "Desire, yes,
always."



VI
Communication and the work



Reading
Reading: in the writer's logbook we are not surprised to come upon confessions of this sort:
"Always this anguish when I go to write . . . ." And when Lomazzo tells us of the fright that
seized Leonardo every time he wished to paint, we understand this too, or we feel that we could
understand.
But were someone to confide in us, "Always anxious when I go to read," or were a person unable
to read except at rare, privileged moments, or were he to overturn his whole life, renounce the
world with its activities and all its happiness just to make his way toward a few minutes of
reading -- doubtless we would assign him a spot beside that patient of Pierre Janet's who did not
like to read because, she said, "a book one reads becomes dirty."
Listening to music makes a musician of him who merely enjoys listening. Likewise looking at a
painting. Music and painting are worlds entered by those who hold the key. The key is
apparently the "gift," and the gift would seem to be the delight and the intelligence of a certain
taste. Amateurs of music and of painting are recognizable types who bear their penchant openly,
with pride, like a delicious pain which sets them apart. The others modestly acknowledge that
they have no ear. One has to be gifted to hear and to see. The gift is a closed space -- concert
hall, museum -- into which one retires in order to enjoy a clandestine pleasure. Those who do not
have the gift remain outside; those who do, go in and out as they please. Naturally, music is
loved on Sundays only; this divinity is no more demanding than another.
Reading requires no gifts at all and shows this appeal to a natural distinction for what it is. No
one is gifted, be he author or reader, and whoever feels that he is feels primarily that he is not --
feels infinitely ill 

equipped, absent from the power attributed to him. And just as to be an "artist" is not to know
that art already exists, that there is already a world, so reading, seeing, hearing the work of art
demands more ignorance than knowledge. It requires a knowledge endowed with an immense
ignorance and a gift which is not given ahead of time, which has each time to be received and
acquired in forgetfulness of it, and also lost. Each painting, each piece of music makes us a
present of the organ we need to welcome it; each one "gives" us the eye and the ear we need to
see and hear it. Nonmusicians are those who make up their minds in advance to refuse this
possibility of hearing; they evade it as though it were a threat or a hindrance which they guard
against suspiciously. André Breton repudiates music, because he wants to preserve in himself the
right to hear the discordant essence of language, his unmusical music. And Kafka, who never
ceases to acknowledge that he is deafer to music than anyone else in the world, does not fail to
discover in this weak point one of his strengths: "I am strong, really. I have a certain strength,
and, to characterize it briefly and not very clearly, it is my unmusicalness."
Generally speaking, he who does not love music cannot stand it, just as the person who rejects a
painting by Picasso thrusts it from him with a violent hatred, as if he felt directly threatened.
That he may not even have looked at the painting says nothing against his good faith. It is not in
his power to look at it. Not to look at it does not put him in the wrong; it is a form of his
sincerity, an accurate premonition of the force that closes his eyes. "I refuse to look at that." "I
couldn't live with that in sight." These clichés bring out the hidden reality of the work of art, its
absolute intolerance, more forcefully than does the amateur's suspect self-satisfaction. It is quite
true that one cannot live with a painting in plain sight.
The plastic arts have this advantage over writing: they manifest more directly the exclusive void
within which the work seems to want to dwell, far from every gaze. The Kiss by Rodin lets itself
be gazed at and even enjoys being thus regarded, but the Balzac goes without a look, it is a
closed and sleeping thing, absorbed in itself to the point of disappearing. The book seems to lack
this decisive separation, which sculpture makes its element and which places in the center of
space another, rebel space -- an inaccessible space both evident and withdrawn, perhaps
immutable, perhaps ever restless, the contained violence in the face of which we always feel in
excess. The statue one digs up and presents for the public's admiration does not expect anything
from this and does not receive anything; it seems, rather, torn

from its place. But the book which one recovers, the manuscript that leaves its drawer to enter
the broad daylight of reading: is it not, by impressive good fortune, born again? What is a book
no one reads? Something that is not yet written. It would seem, then, that to read is not to write
the book again, but to allow the book to be: written -- this time all by itself, without the
intermediary of the writer, without anyone's writing it. The reader does not add himself to the
book, but tends primarily to relieve it of an author. And all the alacrity in his approach (in this
shadow which passes so vainly over the pages and leaves them intact) -- everything that lends
reading its superfluous appearance, including even paltry attention and lack of grave interest: all
the reader's infinite lightness, then, affirms the new lightness of the book, which has become a
book without an author. Now it is a book relieved of the seriousness, the effort, the heavy
anguish, the weight of a whole life that was spilled out into it. It has become a book minus the 
sometimes terrible, the always formidable experience which the reader effaces and, with his
providential unconcern, considers as nothing.
The reader, without knowing it, is engaged in a profound struggle with the author. Whatever
intimacy may subsist today between the book and the writer, and however sharply the figure, the
presence, the history of the author may be brought into focus by the circumstances of the book's
circulation (circumstances which, while not arbitrary, are perhaps already somewhat
anachronistic) -- despite all this, every reading where consideration of the writer seems to play so
great a role is an attack which annihilates him in order to give the work back to itself: back to its
anonymous presence, to the violent, impersonal affirmation that it is. The reader is himself
always fundamentally anonymous. He is any reader, none in particular, unique but transparent.
He does not add his name to the book (as our fathers did long ago); rather, he erases every name
from it by his nameless presence, his modest, passive gaze, interchangeable and insignificant,
under whose light pressure the book appears written, separate from everything and everyone.
Reading makes of the book what the sea and the wind make of objects fashioned by men: a
smoother stone, a fragment fallen from the sky without a past, without a future, the sight of
which silences questions. Reading gives to the book the abrupt existence which the statue
"seems" to get from the chisel alone. From its reading the book acquires the isolation which
witholds the statue from the eyes that see it -- the haughty remove, the orphan wisdom which
dismisses the sculptor along with the gaze wishing to sculpt it still. Somehow the book needs

the reader in order to become a statue. It needs the reader if it is to declare itself a thing without
an author and hence without a reader. It is not primarily a more human truth that reading brings
to the book; but neither does reading make the book something inhuman -- an "object," a pure
compact presence, the fruit of the deep which our sun did not ripen. Reading simply "makes" the
book, the work, become a work beyond the man who produced it, the experience that is
expressed in it and even beyond all the artistic resources which tradition has made available. The
singular property of reading demonstrates the singular sense of the verb "to make" in the
expression "it makes the work become a work." The word make here does not designate a
productive activity. Reading does not produce anything, does not add anything. It lets be what is.
It is freedom: not the freedom that produces being or grasps it, but freedom that welcomes,
consents, says yes, can say only yes, and, in the space opened by this yes, lets the work's
overwhelming decisiveness affirm itself, lets be its affirmation that it is -- and nothing more.
"Lazare, Veni Foras"
A reading which takes the work for what it is, and thus disencumbers it of its author, does not
consist in introducing, in his place, a reader -- a person firmly rooted in existence, having a
history, a profession, a religion, and even reading experience, who, based upon all that, would
begin a dialogue with the other person who wrote the book. Reading is not a conversation; it
does not discuss, it does not question. It never asks of the book, and still less of the author:
"What did you mean exactly? What truth, then, do you bring me?" A genuine reading never puts
the genuine book into question. But neither does it submit to the "text." Only the nonliterary
book is presented as a tightly woven net of determined significations, a set of real affirmations.
Before being read by anyone, the nonliterary book has already been read by all, and it is this
prior reading that guarantees it a solid existence. But the book which has its origin in art has no 
guarantee in the world, and when it is read, it has never been read before. It does not come into
its presence as a work except in the space opened by this unique reading, each time the first and
each time the only.
Hence the strange liberty of which reading -- literary reading -- gives us the prime example: a
movement which is free insofar as it does not submit to, does not brace itself upon anything
already present. The book, doubtless, is there, and not only its paper and ink reality but also its

essence. It is there as a web of stable meanings, as the assertiveness which it owes to a
preestablished language, and as the enclosure, too, formed around it by the community of all
readers, among whom I, who have not read it, already have a place. And this enclosure is also
that of all books which, like angels with intertwined wings, keep close watch over this unknown
volume. For a single book imperiled makes a dangerous gap in the universal library. The book is
there, then, but the work is still hidden. It is absent, perhaps radically so; in any case it is
concealed, obfuscated by the evident presence of the book, behind which it awaits the liberating
decision, the "Lazare, veni foras."
To make this stone fall seems to be reading's mission: to render it transparent, to dissolve it with
the penetrating force of the gaze which unimpeded moves beyond. There is in reading, at least at
reading's point of departure, something vertiginous that resembles the movement by which,
going against reason, we want to open onto life eyes already closed. This movement is linked to
desire which, like inspiration, is a leap, an infinite leap: I want to read what is, however, not
written. But there is more; and what makes the "miracle" of reading still more singular -- what
perhaps enlightens us as to the sense of all thaumaturgies -- is that here the stone and the tomb do
not only withhold the cadaverous void which is to be animated; they constitute the presence,
though dissimulated, of what is to appear. To roll back the stone, to obliterate it, is certainly
something marvelous, but it is something we achieve at every moment in everyday language. At
every moment we converse with Lazarus, dead for three days -- or dead, perhaps, since always.
In his well-woven winding sheet, sustained by the most elegant conventions, he answers us and
speaks to us within ourselves. But what answers the call of literary reading is not a door falling
open or becoming transparent or even getting a bit thinner. It is, rather, a ruder stone, better
sealed, a crushing weight, an immense avalanche that causes earth and sky to shudder.
Such is the nature of the "opening" that reading is made of: nothing opens but that which is
closed tighter; only what belongs to the greatest opacity is transparent; nothing consents to enter
into the levity of a free and happy yes except what has been borne as the crushing weight of a no,
devoid of substance. And this is not to say that the poetic work seeks out obscurity in order to
disconcert everyday comprehension. We are simply situating, between the book which is there
and the work which is never there in advance -- between the book which is the hidden work and
the work which can only be affirmed in the

palpable thickness of this manifest concealment -- a violent rupture: the passage, that is, from the
world where everything has more or less meaning, where there is obscurity and clarity, into a 
space where, properly speaking, nothing has meaning yet, toward which nevertheless everything
which does have meaning returns as toward its origin.
But these remarks too could easily deceive us if we took them to mean that reading blazes a trail
from one language to another, or that it is a bold démarche, a conquest requiring initiative and
persistence. Reading's approach is perhaps a difficult happiness, but, still, reading is the easiest
thing. It is effortless liberty, a pure yes that blossoms in immediacy.
The Light, Innocent Yes of Reading
Reading, in the literary sense, is not even a pure movement of comprehension. It is not the
interpretation that keeps meaning alive by pursuing it. Reading is situated beyond or before
comprehension. Nor is to read exactly to send out a call so that the unique work, which is to be
revealed in the reading, might disclose itself behind the appearance of ordinary language, behind
the book that belongs to everyone in general. Doubtless there is a sort of call, but it can only
come from the work itself. It is a silent call, which amidst the general noise imposes silence, and
which only reaches the reader's ear because he answers it. This call turns him away from
ordinary relations and toward the space in whose proximity the reading, by abiding there,
becomes the approach to the work and an utterly joyful welcome to the work's generosity. And
this welcome lifts the book to the work which it is; and this transport is the same as the one
which lifts the work to being and makes of the welcome the sheer delight whereby the work
proclaims itself. The reading is this abiding, and it has the simplicity of the light and transparent
yes which this sojourn is. Even if it demands of the reader that he enter a zone where he can
scarcely breathe and where the ground slips out from under his feet -- and even if, leaving aside
these stormy approaches, reading still seems to be participation in that open violence, the work --
nonetheless, in itself it is tranquil and silent presence, the calm center of measureless excess, the
silent yes at the eye of every storm.
The freedom of this present yes, this utterly happy and transparent consent, is the essence of
reading. It sets reading in diametrical opposition to the work. For the work, through the
experience of creation, touches upon absence, upon the torments of the infinite; it

reaches the empty depths of that which never begins or ends -- the movement which exposes the
creator to the threat of the essential solitude and delivers him to the interminable.
In this sense reading is more positive than creation: more creative, although it produces nothing.
For it partakes of decisiveness; it has the lightness, the irresponsibility, and the innocence of
resolution. It does nothing, and everything is accomplished. The anguish, the unfinished
narratives, the torment of a wasted life and of a mission betrayed; each day, moreover, turned
into exile, each night an exile from sleep and finally the conviction that "The Metamorphosis is
unreadable, a radical failure" -- all that is for Kafka. But for the reader of Kafka the anguish
becomes ease and contentment, the torment of guilt is transformed into innocence, and for every
shred of text there is the joy of plenitude, the sure evidence of complete success, the revelation of
the unique work: inevitable, unforeseeable. Such is the essence of reading, of the weightless yes.
Much more than the creator's somber struggle, much more than the artist's battle to master chaos
by disappearing therein, it evokes the divine aspect of creation. 
Hence the fact that many complaints of authors against readers seem out of place. Montesquieu
writes: "I ask a favor which I fear will not be granted me: it is that I not be judged for twenty
years' work by a reading that takes one minute; and that the whole book, not a few sentences, be
approved or condemned." He asks for what artists often regret not obtaining when bitterly they
picture to themselves the offhand reading, the distracted glance, and the negligent ear that greets
their works. So many efforts, sacrifices, cares, calculations, a life of solitude, centuries of
meditation and research all evaluated, judged, and suppressed by the ignorant decision of the
first-come, according to the mood he chances to feel. And perhaps Valéry is right to be
concerned about the uncultivated reader of today who expects to be helped along in his reading
by the facile character of the text itself. But the scrupulous attention of an almost religiously
devoted reader whose cultivated reading even becomes a kind of cult would make no difference.
It would entail even graver perils. For if the lightness of the light reader who dances once quickly
round the text is doubtless not a true lightness, it is harmless, and it even holds a certain promise:
it announces the happiness and innocence of reading, which is perhaps in fact a dance with an
invisible partner in a separated space -- a helplessly joyful dance with the "tomb." One must not
wish upon such lightness the movement of a graver concern, for where levity is given us, gravity
does not lack.

Communication
What most threatens reading is this: the reader's reality, his personality, his immodesty, his
stubborn insistence upon remaining himself in the face of what he reads -- a man who knows in
general how to read. To read a poem is not to read yet another poem; it is not even to enter, via
this poem, into the essence of poetry. The reading of a poem is the poem itself, affirming itself in
the reading as a work. It is the poem giving birth, in the space held open by the reader, to the
reading that welcomes it; it is the poem becoming power to read, becoming communication
opened between power and impossibility, between the power linked to the moment of reading
and the impossibility linked to the moment of writing.
Communication of the work lies not in the fact that it has become communicable, through
reading, to a reader. The work is itself communication. It is intimacy shared in struggle by
reading's demand and writing's: by the work as form and measure, constituting itself as power,
and the same work's measureless excess, tending toward impossibility. It is intimate strife shared
moreover by the form where the work takes its shape and the limitlessness where it is all refusal,
by the resolution which is the being of beginning and the indecision which is the being of
beginning over. This violence lasts as long as the work is a work. It is violence that is never
pacified, but it is also the calm of an accord; it is rivalry, and also the reconciliation -- an
understanding. But it breaks off as soon as it ceases to be the approach toward what rules out any
understanding.
To read is thus not to obtain communication from the work, but to "make" the work
communicate itself. And, if we may employ an inadequate image, to read is to be one of the two
poles between which, through mutual attraction and repulsion, the illuminating violence of

communication erupts -- one of the two poles between which that event comes to pass and which
it constitutes by the very passage. But of course this comparison is inadequate. At most it
indicates that the antagonism, which in the work opposes its two moments, reading and writing
(or, more exactly, which makes of the work a tension where its moments seem to oppose each
other two by two), opens the work by means of this radical disjunction to the freedom of its
communication. But we should not so simply represent this antagonism as that of fixed poles
opposing each other like two powers determined once and for all, called reading and writing. It
must at least be added that this antagonistic exaltation, which eventually takes the personified
form of the reader and the author, has never ceased to develop in the course of the work's
genesis. Although, in the end, the work seems to have become a dialogue between two persons in
whom two stabilized demands have been incarnated, this "dialogue" is primarily the more
original combat of more indistinct demands, the torn intimacy of irreconcilable and inseparable
moments which we call measure and measurelessness, form and infinitude, resolution and
indecision. Beneath their successive oppositions, these moments steadily give reality to the same
violence. To the violence, that is, of what tends to open and tends to close, tends to cohere in the
contours of a clear figure that limits, and yet tends to err without end, to lose itself in an ever
restless migration, that of the other night which never comes but comes back again. In this
communication it is obscurity that must reveal itself and night that must dawn. This is revelation
where nothing appears, but where concealment becomes appearance.
The Reader Yet to Come
It is sometimes said that every author writes in the presence of some reader or that he writes in
order to be read. This is a rather careless way of speaking. One ought to say that the reader's role,
or that which will become, once the work is complete, the power or the possibility of reading, is
already present, in changing forms, in the genesis of the work. To the extent that to write is to
snatch oneself back from the impossibility where writing becomes possible, writing assumes the
characteristics of reading's demand, and the writer becomes the nascent intimacy of the still
infinitely future reader. But it goes without saying that this power is nonetheless power to write,
only because of the opposition to itself which it becomes in the experience of impossibility.

There is not power on one side, impossibility on the other; there is no such clash of these
contraries. There is, in the event of the fact of writing, the tension which, through the intimacy
into which the writing gathers them, demands of the opposites what they are in their extreme
opposition, but demands also that they come into their own by quitting themselves, by detaining
each other together outside themselves in the restless unity of their common belonging. The
power in question is power only by comparison with impossibility, the impossibility which is
affirmed as power.
The writer, inasmuch as he remains a real person and believes himself to be this real person who
is writing, also believes that he willingly shelters in himself the reader of what he writes. He
feels within himself, vital and demanding, the role of the reader still to be born. And very often,
through a usurpation which he barely escapes, it is the reader, prematurely and falsely
engendered, who begins to write in him. (Hence, to give only a simplistic example, those choice
passages, those fine phrases which come to the surface and which cannot be said to have been
written, but only to be readable.) This illusion, as we can now understand, comes from the fact 
that the moments which prefigure reading's demand pass through the writer in the course of the
work's genesis. But these moments must, precisely, fall outside of him when they are gathered
together in the final decisiveness of the reading -- in the liberty of the welcome and of the
sojourn near the work which alone constitutes an authentic reading.
The writer can never read his work for the very same reason which gives him the illusion that he
does. "He is," says René Char, "the genesis of being who projects and of a being who contains."
But in order for the "being who contains" -- the being who gives form and measure, the formgiver,
the "Beginner" -- to attain the ultimate metamorphosis which would turn him into "the
reader," the finished work has to escape from him. It has to escape from the one who makes it,
complete itself by putting him at a distance, culminate in this "distancing" which dispossesses
him conclusively, this distancing which then, precisely, takes the form of the reading (and in
which the reading takes form).
The moment when that which is glorified in the work is the work, when the work ceases in some
way to have been made, to refer back to someone who made it, but gathers all the essence of the
work in the fact that now there is a work -- a beginning and initial decision -- this moment which
cancels the author is also the moment when, as the book opens to itself, the reading finds its
origin in this opening.

Reading is born, therefore, at this moment when the work's distance from itself changes its sign.
In the course of the book's genesis this "void" marked the work's unfinished quality, but also the
intimacy of its progression, the first precipitous advances of the "being who projects." This
emptiness changes its sign, and the reading is born at the moment when the distance of the work
with respect to itself no longer indicates incompletion but perfection, no longer signifies that the
work is not yet done, but that it never needed to be done.
In general the reader, unlike the writer, naïvely feels superfluous. He does not think that he
fashions the work. Even if the work overwhelms him, and all the more so if it becomes his sole
concern, he feels that he does not exhaust it, that it remains altogether outside his most intimate
approach. He does not penetrate it; it is free of him, and this freedom makes for the profundity of
his relation to the work, the intimacy of his yes. But in this very yes, the work's freedom still
keeps him at a distance. It reestablishes the distance which alone assures the freedom of the
welcome and which is constantly reborn from the passion of the reading that abolishes it.
This distance is what perfects the work -- if, that is, the reader keeps it pure, and inasmuch as it
is, moreover, the measure of his intimacy with the work. For he is close to the work to the degree
that he recognizes it as a work regardless of him. By removing it from any author and from all
consideration of having been made, this distance gives the work for what it is. And so it would
seem that reading's effacement, which renders it innocent of the work's making and exempts it
from this responsibility, is, for that very reason, nearer to the accomplished work, to the essence
of its creation, than is the author who always believes himself to have made everything and
created all.
Abhorrence of a Vacuum 
But this distance, which evokes the yes of the finished work (given as complete in the moment
when, for the movement that completed it, is substituted the affirmation that it is) -- this distance
of the work with respect to itself, to the reader, to the world's doings, to other works -this
distance which, precisely, constitutes reading's innocence also defines its responsibility and its
risk. It seems to be very difficult to preserve such an interval. Here the natural abhorrence of a
vacuum is expressed in the need to fill it up with a judgment of value. The work is said to be
good or bad with respect to morality, laws, various systems of

values, etc. It is declared to be successful or not with respect to rules (very precarious at present)
which may constitute instances of an esthetic, that is to say the simple impressions of a more or
less refined taste or of a more or less vigorous absence of taste. The work is judged to be rich or
poor with respect to culture, which compares it to other works, which does or does not draw
from it an increase in knowledge, which adds it to the national, to the human treasury or yet
again sees in it only a pretext to talk or to teach.
It is possible that the more a work is esteemed, the more it is imperiled. For when it is designated
as a good work, it is assigned a place on the side of the good which uses it, rendering it
utilitarian. A work which is judged bad sometimes finds room in this judgment to preserve itself.
It is put aside, condemned to the nether regions of libraries, or burned, or forgotten; but in a
sense this exile, this disappearance in the midst of flames or in tepid forgetfulness also extends
the proper distance of the work. It corresponds to the force of the work's remove. This does not
mean that a century later the work will necessarily find the readers it lacked. Posterity is
promised to no one, and no book would consider it a happy ending. The work does not endure
over the ages; it is. This being can inaugurate a new age, for it is an appeal to the beginning,
recalling that nothing is affirmed except through the fecundity of an initial decisiveness. But the
work's very coming to be is revealed by the flash of its disappearance at least as well as by the
false light shed by survival from mere habit. The feeling that works escape time originates in the
work's "distance," and expresses, by disguising it, the remove which always comes from the
work's presence. Our impression that works are ageless expresses, by forgetting it, what makes
the work always accede to presence for the first time in its reading -- its unique reading, each
time the first and each time the only.
The risk which this reading entails, however, is no mere matter of chance. If the work's "void,"
which is its presence to itself in its reading, is difficult to preserve, this is not only because it is in
itself hard to sustain, but also because it remembers, as it were, the void which, in the course of
the work's genesis, marked the incompletion of the work and was the tension of its antagonist
moments. That is why reading draws whoever reads the work into the remembrance of that
profound genesis. Not that the reader necessarily perceives afresh the manner in which the work
was produced -- not that he is in attendance at the real experience of its creation. But he partakes
of the work as the unfolding of something in the making, the intimacy of the void which comes
to

be. If this progression takes on the aspect of a temporal unfolding, it founds the essence of the
literary genre called the novel. 
This kind of reading -- this presence to the work as a genesis -- changes, and thus produces the
critical reading: the reader, now the specialist, interrogates the work in order to know how it was
fashioned. He asks it the secrets and the conditions of its creation, and examines it closely to see
whether it answers adequately to these conditions, etc. The reader, having become the specialist,
becomes an author in reverse. The true reader does not rewrite the book, but he is apt to return,
drawn by an imperceptible pull, toward the various prefigurations of the reader which have
caused him to be present in advance at the hazardous experience of the book. It ceases, then, to
appear necessary to him and again becomes a possibility among others. It regains the
indecisiveness of something uncertain, something altogether still to be achieved. And the work
thus regains its disquietude, the wealth of its indigence, the insecurity of its void, while reading,
joining in this disquietude and espousing this poverty, comes to resemble the desire, the anguish,
and the levity of a movement of passion.
All these metamorphoses belong to the authentic essence of reading. Its task is to keep what we
call the work's distance pure, but no less to keep it alive: to make it communicate with the work's
intimacy, to keep this intimacy from congealing and protecting itself in the vain solitude of the
ideal. The "vacuum" which, in the course of the work's genesis, belongs to the torn intimacy of
the work, seems, in the end, to fall out of it. While opening it altogether to itself, rendering it
absolutely present, the emptiness seems nevertheless to make of this presence the remove which
preserves its approach, giving us the impression that the painting is always behind the painting
and also that the poem, the temple, and the statue escape the vicissitudes of time, whose mark,
however, they bear.
It is as if this divisive void which, in the course of the genesis, is now the abyss where the work
subsides, now the soaring energy by which it comes to light, now that empty violence where
everything repeats eternally but then again the search from which everything begins -- it is as if
this "distant interior," as Michaux calls it, passed, at the moment of completion, altogether
outside, isolating the work, forming around it that halo of absence so characteristic of the
presence ofmasterpieces, which is like their aura of glory and which shelters them beneath a veil
of empty majesty, unexpressive indifference. Thus are works immobilized in a lifeless distance.
Isolated, preserved by a void

which is no longer a reading but a cult of admiration, they cease to be works. The work of art is
never connected to repose, it has nothing to do with the tranquil certitude which makes
masterpieces familiar; it does not take shelter in museums. In this sense it never is. And if,
clumsily transposing the idea that it is not an object someone has perfected, we say of it that its
perfection is everlasting, at least this reminds us that the work never ceases to be related to its
origin: that the incessant experience of the origin is the condition of its being, and also that the
antagonistic violence due to which it was, in the course of its genesis, the opposition of its
contrary moments, is not just a feature of this genesis, but belongs to the character of agonistic
struggle which is the character of the work's very being. The work is the violent liberty by which
it is communicated, and by which the origin -- the empty and indecisive depth of the origin -- is
communicated through the work to form the brimming resolution, the definiteness of the
beginning. That is why the work tends ever increasingly to manifest the experience of the work:
the experience which is not exactly that of its creation and which is not that of its technical
fashioning either. This experience leads the work ceaselessly back from the clarity of the 
beginning to the obscurity of the origin and subjects its brilliant apparition, the moment of its
opening, to the disquietude of the dissimulation into which it withdraws.
The reading which takes form in the work's distance -- the reading which is the form of this void
and the moment when it seems to fall out of the work -- must thus also be a profound return to its
intimacy, to what seems its eternal birth. Reading is not an angel flying about the work and, with
winged feet, making this sphere turn. It is not the look which from without, from behind the
window, captures what is happening within a foreign world. It is connected to the life of the
work. It is present at all the work's moments. It is one of them, and it is by turns and at the same
time each of them. It is not only their remembrance, their ultimate transfiguration; it retains in
itself everything that is really at stake in the work. That is why in the end it alone bears all the
weight of communication.
The Work and History
It is not surprising then, that, strengthened by such intimacy, reading, incarnated in the reader,
should naturally proceed to take over the work, wanting to "grasp" it, reducing and eliminating
all distance from it. Nor is it surprising that reading should make of this distance,

this sign of the work's completion, the principle of a new genesis: the realization of the work's
historical destiny. In the world of culture, the work becomes the guarantor of truths and the
repository of meaning. None of this is surprising; this movement is inevitable. But it does not
simply mean that the artistic work follows the course of works in general and obeys the law that
moves them through their successive transformations. For this movement is also encouraged by
the work's own nature. It comes from the profound distance of the work from itself, the remove
due to which it always escapes what it is -- seems, for example, definitively finished and yet
incomplete; seems, in the restlessness that steals it from every grasp, to enter into complicity
with the infinite variations of becoming. The distance which puts the work beyond our reach and
beyond time's -- where it perishes in glorious immobility -- also exposes it to all the
contingencies of time, showing it ceaselessly in search of a new form, of another culmination,
acquiescing in all the metamorphoses which, attaching it to history, seem to make of its remove
the promise of an unlimited future.
Thus the reading which initially projected itself into the intimacy of the work, only to fall out of
it the better to maintain it and to fix it in a monumental immobility, finally projects itself outside
and makes of the work's intimate life something which can no longer be realized unless it is
displayed in the world and filled with the world's life and with history's.
This transformation is produced to the extent that the "empty" movement takes on content, while
the work, momentarily or definitively losing the force and the intimacy of its constant genesis,
unfolds as a newborn world where values are at stake and where these values call for arbitration
by some criterion or contribute to the advent of such a standard, such a truth.
So: that which, in the work, was communication of the work to itself, the origin blossoming into
a beginning, becomes the communication of a given thing. That which, opening it, made the
work the advent and the brilliance of what opens becomes an opened place, in the image of this
world of stable things and in imitation of this subsisting reality where, from a need to subsist, we 
live. And that which had neither sense nor truth nor value, but in which everything seemed to
take on sense, becomes the language which says true things, says false things, and which one
reads for instruction, for increased self-knowledge, or to cultivate the mind.
Through this realization then, the work is realized outside of itself and also on the model of
exterior things, at their invitation. Through

this movement -- determined, so to speak, by gravity -- instead of being the force of the
beginning, the work becomes a thing beginning. Instead of getting all its reality from the pure,
contentless affirmation that it is, it becomes an enduring reality, containing many meanings
which it acquires from the movement of time or which are perceived variously according to
culture's forms and the exigencies of history. And through all this, through all that makes it
graspable -- makes of it no longer the being of the work but the work functioning in the
productive fashion of works of the world -- it puts itself at the reader's service. It takes part in the
public dialogue. It expresses or it refutes what is generally said; it consoles, it entertains, it bores,
not by virtue of itself or by virtue of a relation with the void and the cutting edge of its being, but
via its content, and then finally thanks to its reflection of the common language and the current
truth. At this juncture what is read is surely no longer the work; rather, these are the thoughts of
everyone rethought, our common habits rendered more habitual still, everyday routines
continuing to weave the fabric of our days. And this movement is in itself very important, one
which it is not fitting to discredit. But neither the work of art nor its reading is present here.
This transformation is not definitive; it is not even an evil or a good for the work. Disappearance,
even when it is disguised as useful presence, belongs to the work's essence; and we should add
that it is also related to the dialectic of art. This movement leads from the hymn -- where the
work, art, and the world are absent -- to the work where men and the world seek to make
themselves present, and from there to the work where the very experience of the work -- art, the
communication of the origin as a beginning -- is affirmed in a presence which is also
disappearance.
It is sometimes said regretfully that the work of art will never again speak the language it spoke
when it was born, the language of its birth, which only those who belonged to the same world
heard and received. Never again will the Eumenides speak to the Greeks, and we will never
know what was said in that language. This is true. But it is also true that the Eumenides have still
never spoken, and that each time they speak it is the unique birth of their language that they
announce. Long ago they spoke as enraged and appeased divinities before withdrawing into the
temple of night -- and this is unknown to us and will ever remain foreign. Later they spoke as
symbols of the dark forces that must be combated in order for there to be justice and culture --
and this is only too well known to us. Finally, one day, perhaps they will speak as the

work in which language is always original, in which it is the language of the origin. And this is
unknown to us, but not foreign. And notwithstanding all this, reading and vision each time
recollect, from the weight of a given content and along the ramifications of an evolving world,
the unique intimacy of the work, the wonder of its constant genesis and the swell of its unfurling.

Literature and the Original Experience



The Future and the Question of Art
A sound response puts down roots in the question. The question is its sustenance. Common sense
believes that it does away with the question. Indeed, in the so-called happy eras, only the
answers seem alive. But this affirmative contentment soon dies off. The authentic answer is
always the question's vitality. It can close in around the question, but it does so in order to
preserve the question by keeping it open.
"What is art, and what can be said of literature?" Doubtless this kind of question is peculiarly
ours, central to our times. However, since each time an answer is given, the question manages to
be asked anew, as though it were indifferent to these answers, we can hardly avoid seeing in the
"anew" a particularly surprising insistence. It may be that the question is only seeking peace in
the repetition where what has once been said lapses into mere recitation. But perhaps by this
harassment the question means above all to remain open. To remain in suspense? No. If we
maintain oppositions, if we let them clash in the sterile space where what opposes itself never
meets with itself, we altogether miss the liveliness of the question. We must, then, set aside that
contrariness which tires problems out, and on the contrary, firmly keep literature separate from
the debates where it divides without being able to return to itself as if to the origin of this divide.
The work: insofar as we locate all the seriousness of art in this one notion, we ought, it seems, to
reconcile those who are naïvely anxious to glorify art and those who, since what they value in
artistic activity is what makes it an activity and not a useless passion, wish to see it collaborate in
the overall work of humanity. Both are prepared to acknowledge in man the excellence of a
power and in the artist the exercise of a form of this power -- requiring effort, discipline, study.
Both

say of human power that it has worth because it edifies -- that is, builds. And does so not in some
atemporal place, out of this world, but here and now, according to the limits which are properly
ours and in conformity with the laws of all action to which it submits, just as it acquiesces in the
ultimate goal: the completion of a work -- an edifice in this world or, better, the edifice which is
the true world to come where only freedom shall dwell. 
Doubtless there subsists in this agreement a great disagreement. Art certainly aims to build, but
according to itself and without welcoming anything of the clear light of day except what is
proper to its particular task. Granted, art has as its goal something real: an object. But a beautiful
object. Which is to say, an object of contemplation, not of use, which, moreover, will be
sufficient to itself, will rest in itself, refer to nothing else, and be its own end (in the two senses
of this term). True. And yet, points out the other side of this thinking, the goal of art is an object -
- a real, that is, an effective one. Not a momentary dream, a pure inner smile, but a realized
action which is itself activating, which informs or deforms others, appeals to them, affects them,
moves them -- toward other actions which, most often, do not return to art but belong to the
course of the world. They contribute to history and thus are lost, perhaps, in history. But there
they will ultimately be regained, in the concrete work which freedom will have become: the
world, the world realized as its very wholeness.
This is a strong and important answer. Art, as we see in Mallarmé, and then, in a different light,
in Valéry, appears to vouch for Hegel's saying: man is what he makes. If there is anyone who is
to be judged by his works, it is the artist. He is, so they say, the creator: the creator of a new
reality, which opens in the world a wider perspective, a possibility by no means closed but such,
on the contrary, that reality in all its forms is enlarged because of it. He is, moreover, the creator
of himself in what he creates. He is a richer artist because of the trials he undergoes for the sake
of his works. He is other than he was thanks to this process, and if sometimes he is exhausted
and dying in the work, it is thereby only the more alive.
Art is real in the work. And the work is real in the world, because it is realized there (in harmony
with the world, even in the upheaval and the rupture), for it contributes to the world's realization
and has no sense, will have no rest except in the world where man will be all he can be, man par
excellence. But what is the result of this? Within the overall human undertaking, where the tasks
conforming to the universal

will for production and emancipation are necessarily the most immediately important, art can
only follow. It can at most feign ignorance of this general destiny by considering that in the
universe which bears it along it revolves according to its own little laws. But ultimately, even
according to its own little laws which make of the work its only measure, art will collaborate as
consciously and rigorously as possible in mankind's overall work, and for the sake of a universal
day.
Is Art a Thing of the Past?
But what else results from this? Whoever acknowledges effective action in the thick of history as
his essential task cannot prefer artistic action. Art acts poorly and little. It is clear that if Marx
had followed the dreams of his youth and written the most beautiful novels in the world, he
would have enchanted the world, but he would not have shaken it. Thus it is Capital that must be
written and not War and Peace. We must not depict the murder of Caesar; we must be Brutus.
These associations, these comparisons will appear absurd to contemplative minds. But as soon as
art measures itself against action, immediate and pressing action can only put it in the wrong. It
suffices to remember what Hölderlin wrote -- Hölderlin about whom it would not be enough to
say that his fate was linked to poetry's, for he had no existence at all except in and for poetry.
And yet, in 1799, speaking of the revolution which he saw imperiled, he wrote to his brother, 
"And if the kingdom of darkness erupts after all in full force, then let us throw our pens under the
table and go in God's name where the need is greatest and our presence the most useful."
Artistic activity, for him indeed who has chosen it, proves insufficient at the decisive hours --
those hours that ring every hour -- when "the poet must complete his message by renouncing
himself." Formerly, art was able to coexist with other absolute demands. Painting served the
gods, poetry made them speak. For these powers were not of this world, and, reigning outside of
time, they did not measure the value of services rendered them in terms of temporal
effectiveness. Art was also at the service of politics, but politics did not serve action only, and
action had not yet become conscious of itself as the universal requirement. As long as the world
has not yet come altogether into its own, art can probably reserve a place for itself there. But it is
the artist himself who condemns this preserve if, having recognized in the work the essence of
art, he thereby acknowledges the priority of the overall work

of humanity. The place reserved for him in the world permits him to act in his work. But the
work is nothing more, then, than the action of this reserve. It is simply a reservation, and
therefore nonactivating. It is pure and simple reticence with respect to the historical undertaking
which does not call for reserve, but for immediate, active, and orderly participation in
generalized action. Thus, faithful to the law of the day, the artist finds himself in a position
where not only does he subordinate the artistic work but renounces it and, out of fidelity,
renounces himself. One hundred and forty years later another poet echoes Hölderlin -- the poet
most worthy in our time to answer him:
In certain periods man's condition undergoes the icy assult of an evil sustained by the most
dishonorable features of human nature. At the center of this hurricane, the poet will complete the
sense of his message by renouncing himself, then will join the side of those who, having lifted
from suffering its mask of legitimacy, assure the eternal return of the stubborn burden-bearer, the
smuggler of justice. [ René Char]
No one can easily consider himself exempt from this "renunciation," this abdication in favor of
liberating action which the "self," the artistic self, impedes or only aids insufficiently. In 1934
André Gide wrote, "For a long time now, works of art will be out of the question." 1 And the fact
that Hegel, a century earlier, at the beginning of his monumental course on esthetics, pronounced
this sentence, "Art is for us a thing of the past," constitutes a judgment upon which art must
reflect and which it will by no means consider refuted simply because since that date literature,
the plastic arts, and music have produced substantial works. For at the moment Hegel spoke, he
knew full well that Goethe was still alive and that all the arts in the West had experienced a
renewal called Romanticism. What did he mean then, he who never spoke "lightly"? This,
precisely: that since the day when the absolute consciously became the active process which is
history, art has no longer been able to satisfy the need for an absolute. Relegated within us, it has
lost its reality and its necessity; everything that was authentically true and alive in it now belongs
to the world and to real, purposeful activity in the world.

1
"For a long time now, works of art will be out of the question. In order to lend an ear to new,
indistinct harmonies, one would have to be not deafened by lamentation. There is practically 
nothing in me any more that does not suffer sympathetically.

The Romantic Genius
"Relegated within us," Hegel says. Art is consigned to represent us to ourselves, and thus it has
become esthetic enjoyment, the pleasure and pastime of an intimacy which is reduced to itself
alone. It is, however, "within us" that art has sought to regain its sovereignty, its "value which
cannot be evaluated" ( René Char). The entire modern period is marked by this double
movement which is already perceptible in Descartes: a perpetual play of exchange between an
existence that becomes an increasingly pure, subjective intimacy and the ever more active and
objective conquest of the world according to the aims of the realizing mind and the productive
will. Hegel was the first to account fully for this double movement; and thereby, joined to Marx,
he made its culmination possible.
Art too plays its part in this destiny, and sometimes it becomes artistic activity; but this activity is
always reserved, and for that reason it is ultimately called upon to give way before the forthright
truth of unreserved, immediate action. Sometimes it encloses itself in the affirmation of an inner
sovereignty which accepts no law and repudiates all power. The stages of this proud vindication
are well known. The artistic ego affirms that it is the sole judge of itself, the only justification for
what it does and what it seeks. Romanticism's notion of genius strengthens this royal subject
which is not only beyond ordinary rules but foreign to the law of achievement and success on its
own terrain as well. Art, useless to the world where only effectiveness counts, is also useless to
itself. If it succeeds, either this happens outside the realm of measured undertakings and limited
tasks, in the boundless movement of life, or else it happens inasmuch as art withdraws into the
most invisible and the most interior -- into the empty point of existence where it shelters its
sovereignty in refusal and the superabundance of refusal.
This demand, that art be ineffective, is by no means a vain flight which there would be no need
to take seriously. Nothing is more important than this absolute autonomy which is refusal and
than this refusal which, through a change in sign, is also the most prodigious affirmation. For it is
the gift, the creative gift, that dispenses without restraint and without justification, that never can
be justified yet upon which

xWherever my gaze turns, I see around me only distress. He who remains contemplative today
demonstrates an inhuman philosophy, or monstrous blindness" ( Journals, July 25, 1934).

justice can be founded. And if art, relegated within us, has not been appeased by the small
contentment of esthetic pleasure, it is thanks to this demand. Why, instead of dissipating itself in
pure satisfaction, the joy afforded by lovely objects, or in the frivolous vanity of an escapist ego,
has the passion of art, whether it be in Van Gogh or in Kafka, become absolutely serious? Why
has it become passion for the absolute? Why are Hölderlin, Mallarmé, Rilke, Breton, René Char
names signifying that in the poem a possibility subsists for which neither culture nor historical
effectiveness nor even the pleasure of beautiful language can account? Why do these names tell
us that a possibility capable of nothing persists as the sign in man of his own ascendency? This is
not an easy question to answer; perhaps it cannot yet be perceived in its true light. 
At the very least we must bring out the difficulties which this demand or this passion encounters.
The greatest difficulty does not lie in the threat which it brings to bear upon the future of
masterpieces. It is true that art, in this perspective, no longer identifies itself entirely with the
work; it is not the same as its product. It is no longer on the side of the real; it no longer seeks its
proof in the presence of a finished object. It affirms itself without proof in the deep of sovereign
existence, prouder of an indecipherable Goya sketch than of the whole history of painting. When
Goethe's Prometheus -- when the Goethe of the Titanic affirmation -- cries: "Have you not alone
accomplished everything, sacred burning of the heart?," this "accomplished everything" is the
passionate demonstration with which intimacy responds to the reproaches of the purposeful
temperament. This sovereignty, then, has no kingdom. It burns in the solitude of the sacred. The
heart's passion alone accomplishes all, for it is exposed to the fire which is the essence and the
movement of All.
It is this omnipotence, symbolized by the Titans banished in the depths of Tartarus because their
insatiable desire is the torment and the burning wheel of repetition, not the active negativity of
time and productive action -- it is this Titanic omnipotence that keeps watch at this point over art.
Art is the subjective passion which no longer wants any part of the world. Here in the world
subordination reigns: subordination to ends, to measured proportion, to seriousness and order.
On one front science, technology, the state; on another, significance, stable values, the ideal of
the Good and the True. Art is "the world turned upside down": insubordination, disproportion,
frivolity, ignorance, evil, non-sense. All this belongs to art: a wide domain, and one to which art
lays claim. What entitles it to do so? It has no title, nor can it have any, for nothing authorizes it.
It speaks of the heart, of irreducible

existence, it designates the sovereignty of the "subject." Strikingly enough, scarcely had
Descartes opened the world to the Cogito's advance than Pascal closed the Cogito upon a more
hidden intimacy which denounces it as "useless, uncertain and painful." But no less strikingly,
this heart also has a logic, and this logic is not indifferent to reason, for it wants to be reason's
principle. It only says that it is more certain, more substantial, more apt. "And it is upon this
awareness, which is the heart's and instinct's, that reason must be based, and there its whole
discourse must be founded." With a single stroke the sovereign power which haughtily dismisses
science, which overturns useful into useless and cannot "pardon Descartes," is firmly established.
But, with the same stroke, sovereignty is made to serve what it dominates. It becomes the
auxiliary and the instrument of purposeful activity; it becomes useful to the world and even to
numbers, to the rigor of mathematics. 2 A memorable reversal. Pascal is finally still a Cartesian.
If he discloses the profundity of pure inner life, if he restores its richness, its free movement, it is
Descartes he enriches and fortifies. For it is based upon the self that Descartes founds objectivity.
And the more this self becomes deep, insatiable, and empty, the more powerful is the advance of
the human will, which already in the heart's intimacy (but with a still unperceived intention) has
posed the world as a set of objects that can be produced and are destined to usefulness.
The artist who thinks he sovereignly opposes all values and protects within himself through his
art the source of all-powerful negation submits to the universal destiny no less than the artist who
produces "useful" works. Perhaps he submits more. It is no accident that he cannot define art
except with reference to the world. Art is the world overturned. But this overturning is also
simply the "sly" means by which the world becomes more stable and more real. This tactic is of 
course limited, and only important at certain moments; history rejects it later on when, having
itself clearly become negativity in action, it finds the dialectical vitality which assures it of its
goal in the development of technical prowess.
The Question of Art
"What is art, and what can we say of literature?" Is art, then, for us a thing of the past? But why

language of the gods; it seems, the gods having disappeared, that art remains the language in
which their absence speaks -- their lack, the hesitancy which has not yet decided their fate. It
seems, as this absence grows deeper -- becomes its own absence and forgetfulness of itself -- that
art seeks to become the presence of art, but that it does so initially by offering to man a means of
self-recognition, of self-fulfillment. At this stage, art is what we call humanistic. It oscillates
between the modesty of its useful manifestations (literature tends increasingly toward effective,
interesting prose), and useless pride in being pure essence. This pride is most often expressed by
the triumph of subjective states: art becomes a condition of the soul, it is "criticism of life," it is
useless passion. Poetic here means subjective. Art appears as the artist and the artist as man -- as
man in the most general sense. Art is expressed to the extent that the artist represents humanity:
represents, that is, the human being he is regardless of his particular being as an artist.
One might think at first that art's "humanism" lies principally in imitation or in the human
preoccupations which it embraces. Thus it would seem that in order to become autonomous or
essential again, art need only disengage itself from this subordinate role. But realist imitation is
only the most apparent side of "humanistic" art. Just as Cartesian representation contains in itself
the power of science (the power of conquest, the ability to conquer reality by negating and
transforming it), so the artist becomes he who by representing transforms. He becomes the one
who creates, the creator, but always, nonetheless, man the creator -- creation at the level of man,
of man understood as the ability to produce and to act, as the will to exert power, whose true
nature is revealed by commitment to goals, by thought's need of objects in order to find its way.
The fact that art is glorified in the creative artist is indicative of a great change in art. Art accepts
subordination to him who practices it, consenting to be no more than he.
Clearly art's profound disquietude (most evident in literature which, through culture and the
forms of language opens immediately to the development of historical action) -- clearly the
alienation which makes art seek itself by glorifying values that can only subordinate it -- is
symptomatic of the artist's malaise in a world where he perceives himself to be unjustified. The
importance which attaches to the notion of the creator is very revealing in this regard. The
ambiguity of this idea has made it rather versatile. For sometimes it has allowed art to take
shelter in the inactive depths of subjectivity, the intensity of genius, the heart Pascal evokes
when he says to Descartes and to his methodical

task, "All that is ridiculous, not worth a single hour of effort." Sometimes, on the other hand, it
gives art the right to compete for power and authority in the world, by defining the artist as the
realizer, the superlative maker whom it claims, moreover, to protect against the anonymity of
collective tasks by assuring him that he remains the exemplary individual, or man on a grand
scale. For the creator is always unique; he aims to remain what he is irreducibly within himself, a
treasure which cannot be compared even to the greatest action.
There is more that must be said. As we constantly hear it expressed in the most naïve or the most
subtle ways, the artist claims the name creator because he thinks that thus he takes the place left
vacant by the absence of the gods. This is a strangely deceptive ambition. It is an illusion,
causing him to think he will become divine if he assumes the least divine of the god's functions,
the one which is not sacred, which makes of God a laborer six days of the week, the demiurge,
the "jack of all trades." This illusion, moreover, veils the emptiness upon which art must close,
which it must in a certain way preserve as if this absence were its profound truth, the form in
which it is properly to present art itself as its own essence.
Creativity does not become the divine attribute par excellence until the dawn of the accelerated
period of history, when man becomes pure selfhood, but also effective action bent upon real
ends, the expectation of an objective accomplishment. The artist who calls himself creator does
not receive the heritage of the sacred, but only introduces into this heritage the preeminent
principle of its subordination.
The New Search for Art
However, through another movement no less remarkable, art -- man's presence to himself -- does
not manage to be satisfied with this humanist avatar which history reserves for it. It has to
become its own presence. What it wants to affirm is art. What it seeks, what it attempts to
achieve is the essence of art. This is striking in painting when, as Malraux has shown, it becomes
apparent as one whole, but emerges also as its essence, destined to itself, no longer subordinated
to values which it is supposed to celebrate or express, but in its own service alone, devoted to an
absolute which neither living forms nor the tasks of men nor even formal esthetic concerns can
name, so that it cannot be called anything but painting. This is a tendency which can be
interpreted in many different ways, but it forcefully reveals a movement which, in

varying degrees and along diverse paths, draws all the arts toward themselves, concentrates them
upon the concern for their own essence, renders them present and essential. This is true for the
poem (for literature "in general"), 3
for the plastic arts; perhaps it is true for Schoenberg.
Why this tendency? Why, when history subordinates it, contests it, does art become essential
presence? Why Mallarmé and why Cézanne? Why, at the very moment when the absolute tends
to take the form of history, when the times have concerns and interests no longer in harmony
with the sovereignty of art, when the poet yields to the belletrist and he to the chronicler of the
day-to-day -- why, at the moment when through the force of the times art disappears, does it
appear for the first time as a search in which something essential is at stake, where what counts is
no longer the artist or active labor or any of the values upon which the world is built or even any
of the other values upon which formerly the beyond opened? And why is this search nonetheless
precise, rigorous, bent upon culminating in a work, in a work which is, and nothing more? 
This is a remarkable phenomenon, difficult to grasp, more difficult still to interpret. But perhaps,
before attempting any interpretation, we should go back to the insufficient reflections which have
permitted us up to this point to discern the notion of the work.

3
The fact that literary forms, that genres no longer have any genuine significance -- that, for
example, it would be absurd to ask whether Finnegans Wake is a prose work or not, or
whether it can be called a novel -- indicates the profound labor of literature which seeks to
affirm itself in its essence by ruining distinctions and limits.

Characteristics of the Work of Art
Clearly the work of art has characteristics of its own. To distinguish itself from other forms of
the human undertaking and from activity in general is its intent. Perhaps it does no more than
pretend to this distinction. Or does what the work aims to be express the truth of what it is? In
any case, we must try to describe it in the claims it makes too, which should enlighten us, if not
about the work itself, at least about the questions it raises.
"Impersonified, the Volume"
The work of art does not refer immediately back to the person who presumably made it. When
we know nothing at all about the circumstances that contributed to its production, about the
history of its creation -- when we do not even know the name of the person who made it possible
-- it is then that the work comes closest to itself. This is its true direction; it is this characteristic
which is expressed in that superlative phenomenon, the masterpiece. Perfection, in the sense
given this word by estheticians, is not what distinguishes the masterpiece, nor is the mastery
which belongs to the artist and not to the work. Valéry is right to say that mastery is what permits
one never to finish what one does. Only the artisan's mastery culminates in the object he
fashions. For the artist the work is always infinite, unfinished. And thus the fact that the work is,
the singular event of its being absolutely, is disclosed as not belonging to the mastery we
associate with achievement. It belongs to another order.
Nor is the masterpiece defined by the long life which is promised it, though this seems to be the
most envied privilege -- at least in our late Occident -- of artistic production. When we are
confronted with Les Chants de Maldoror, we by no means suppose that they will be immortal.

That which assures their being absolutely, would not prevent them from disappearing absolutely.
That which has placed them before us, the affirmation which they bring us, is not to be measured
against historical duration; it asks neither for survival in this world nor for promotion to culture's
paradise.
It is Mallaréie who had the strongest awareness of this aspect of the work. "Impersonified, the
volume, to the degree that one parts with it as author, solicits the approach of no reader. As such,
be it known, between human accessories it takes place all alone: done, being." And his defiance
of chance is a transposition of this "takes place all alone," a symbolic attempt to achieve "the
elocutionary disappearance of the poet" -- an experiment, finally, at grasping, as though at its 
source, not that which makes the work real, but the "impersonified" reality in it: that which
makes it be, far more or still less than any reality.
But: does an object fashioned by an artisan or with a machine refer to its maker any more than
the work of art does? It too is impersonal, anonymous. It does not bear any author's name.
Yes, this is true; it does not refer to the person who presumably made it, but neither does it refer
to itself. As has often been observed, it disappears altogether into its uses. It refers to all it does,
to its utilitarian value. The object never announces that it is, but how it serves. It does not appear.
In order that it appear -- this too has often been said -- a break in the circuit of usage, a gap, an
anomaly has to make it leave the world, leave its senses. And it seems then that, no longer there,
it becomes its appearance, its image -- what it was before being a useful thing or a significant
value. This is also when it becomes, for Jean-Paul Richter and for André Breton, a veritable
work of art.
That the work is marks the explosive brilliance of a unique event which comprehension can then
take over, to which it feels it owes itself as if this event were its beginning, but which it initially
understands only as that which escapes it. This event is incomprehensible because it happens in
that anterior region which we cannot designate except under the veil of no. Our question
continues to be the search for this region.
For the moment, let us simply acknowledge that the brilliance, the explosive decision -- this
presence or "lightning moment" (to use the expression to which Mallarmé and all those who
resemble him since Heraclitus have always returned in order to express this event, the work) --
let us acknowledge that such a dazzling affirmation arises neither from the assurance of stable
truths nor from the clarity of the day which we have conquered and where living and being are
accomplished

in actions whose limits are familiar to us. The work brings neither certitude nor clarity. It assures
us of nothing, nor does it shed any light upon itself. It is not solid, it does not furnish us with
anything indestructible or indubitable upon which to brace ourselves. These values belong to
Descartes and to the world where we succeed in living. Just as every strong work abducts us
from ourselves, from our accustomed strength, makes us weak and as if annihilated, so the work
is not strong with respect to what it is. It has no power, it is impotent: not because it is simply the
obverse of possibility's various forms, but rather because it designates a region where
impossibility is no longer deprivation, but affirmation.
The Statue Glorifies the Marble
The obscurity of this presence which escapes comprehension, which is unascertainable yet
brilliant, explosive, and which, at the same time that it is an event, seems the silent repose of a
closed thing -- all this we try to bear in mind and define appropriately by saying: the work is
eminently what it is made of. It is what makes its nature and its matter visible or present, it is the
glorification of its reality: verbal rhythm in the poem, sound in music, light become color in
painting, space become stone in the house.
By saying this we are still attempting to indicate what distinguishes the work from the object and
from productive undertakings in general. For in the usual object (this much we know), matter 
itself is of no particular interest; and the more the matter that made it made it right for its use --
the more the material is appropriate -- the more it nears nothingness. And eventually all objects
become immaterial, a volatile force in the swift circuit of exchange, the evaporated support of
action which is itself pure becoming. This is evoked perfectly by the various transformations of
money -- from the heavy metal to that ungraspable vibration by which all the realities of the
world, reduced to objects, are themselves transformed in the movement of the market place and
volatilized into unreal moments in constant displacement.
The work makes what disappears in the object appear. The statue glorifies the marble. The
painting is not made from material ingredients added to a canvas; it is the presence of this matter,
which without it would remain hidden to us. And the poem likewise is not made with ideas, or
with words; it is the point from which words begin to become their appearance, and the
elemental depth upon which this appearance is opened while at the same time it closes.

This last remark in itself suggests that the emphasis we have placed on the material character of
the work cannot result in a satisfactory definition; the work is not adequately accounted for by
this thingly realness which it seems to place before us. This description is still only a sound
comparison. It is, nevertheless, important, for it shows us that if the sculptor uses stone, and if
the road builder also uses stone, the first uses it in such a way that it is not used, consumed,
negated by usage, but affirmed, revealed in its obscurity, as a road which leads only to itself.
"Shifting Earth, Horrible, Exquisite"
Thus the work points us toward the deep of obscurity which we do not think we have designated
by calling it elemental. Certainly it is not nature, for nature is always affirmed as already born
and formed. Probably René Char is calling to this deep when he addresses the "shifting earth,
horrible, exquisite"; Hölderlin calls it Mother Earth, the earth closed upon its silence, the
subterranean earth that withdraws into its shadow. Rilke speaks to it thus: "Earth, is this not what
you want, to be reborn invisible in us?" And Van Gogh shows it to us more forcefully still by
saying, "I am attached to the earth." But these mythic names, powerful in themselves, remain
foreign to what they name.
Here, however, where we seek only to take cognizance of the principal features of the work, let
us remember that it is turned toward the elemental deep, toward that element which would seem
to be the depth and shadow of the elemental. We know that objects do not allude to this deep, but
that all the arts, in the appearance of being which they give to the matter out of which,
afterwards, we say that their products are made, bring it forth among us in the unique event of
the work.
Still, even from the point of view of description, we feel how inadequate this analysis is. For
when the work takes place, certainly the elemental is illuminated and the deep is as if present, as
if attracted toward the daylight (even though the work also pushes this deep down deeper by
resting its full weight there). But with this compact emergence, this presence of "matter" in itself,
not only does the matter proper to a particular form of art seem to be affirmed: it is not the stone
alone and only the marble that the Temple of Eupalinos evokes, or the earth upon which it is
built, but, by the force of the upheaval, the clear sky as well is more so to our eyes, and the sea it
overlooks is nearer to itself, the night closer to night. Such, says Valéry, are the edifices which
"sing."

When Hölderlin, in the first conversations with Sinclair on madness -- conversations which
probably date from 1804 -- says of every work of art that it is a unique rhythm, he designates this
same region, where everything is outer but as if impenetrable and closed.
When rhythm has become the sole and unique mode of thought's expression, it is then only that
there is poetry. In order for mind to become poetry, it must bear in itself the mystery of an innate
rhythm. It is in this rhythm alone that it can live and become visible. And every work of art is but
one and the same rhythm. Everything is simply rhythm. The destiny of man is a single celestial
rhythm, as every work of art is a unique rhythm.
We must also call to mind these words of Mallarmé, written with a view to reaffirming "the old
genius of verse":
Thus launched independently, the principle which is none -- but Verse! -- attracts no less than
disengages for its unfurling (the instant they shine there and die in a swift flower, upon some
transparency like ether's) the thousand elements of beauty hastening to press near and to order
themselves in the essential value. Sign! in the central abyss of a spiritual impossibility that
anything be exclusive of everything, the divine numerator of our apotheosis, some supreme mold
which does not take place as any object that exists: but it borrows all the scattered ores, unknown
and floating according to some richness, to quicken there a seal, and to forge them.
This is an imposing text. For it assembles most of the work's claims: presence, the fact of being,
which does not relate to historical duration and of which Rilke is probably speaking when,
opposing Cézanne to impressionistic painting, he says: "They painted: I love this thing, instead
of painting: here it is." This presence is not spiritual, or ideal, for it attracts to it the thousand
elements, it borrows all the scattered ores unknown and floating, ("shifting earth, horrible,
exquisite," says Char). Yet these ores, the elemental night of rhythm, the profundity which the
name "elements" designates as materiality -- all this the work attracts, but to disengage it, to
reveal it in its essence, an essence which is the elemental obscurity. And in this obscurity thus
rendered essentially present, not dissipated but disengaged, rendered visible upon some
transparency like ether's, the work becomes that which unfurls, that which quickens, the
blossoming of the apotheosis.

The Work, "Exalting Alliance of Contraries"
We see defining itself here another of the work's characteristic requirements. The work is not the
deadened unity of repose. It is the intimacy and the violence of contrary movements which are
never reconciled and never appeased -- never, at least, as long as the work is a work. The work is
the intimate confrontation with itself of an opposition between contraries, neither of which,
though they are irreconcilable, has coherence except in the contest that opposes them one to the
other. The work is this torn intimacy inasmuch as it is the "unfurling" of that which nevertheless
hides and remains closed -- a light shining on the dark, a light bright from the clarity of this
darkness, which abducts and ravishes the dark in the first light of the unfurling, but also 
disappears into the absolutely obscure whose essence is to close in upon whatever would reveal
it, to attract this disclosure into itself and swallow it up. René Char is alluding to this "exalting
alliance of contraries" when he says, "The poet is the genesis of a being who projects and of a
being who contains." The duality of content and form, of word and idea, is the commonest
attempt, based upon the world and the language of the world, to understand the work in the
violence which unifies it as the unique event of an essential discord within which only what is in
struggle can be grasped and qualified.
Rilke, in the twenty-sixth sonnet (the first part), speaks thus of Orpheus, of the lost and
dismembered god:
O you, lost god! you infinite trace!
By dismembering you the hostile forces had to disperse you
To make of us now hearers and a mouth of nature.
The work is Orpheus, but it is also the adverse power which tears it and divides Orpheus. And
thus, in the intimacy of this rip, he who produces the work (the creator) originates as he who
consecrates, who preserves it by listening to it (the reader). Hearing, speaking are determined in
the work at the breach, in the torn unity which alone founds dialogue. The poet only speaks by
listening. For he lives in the separation where the still wordless rhythm and the voice that says
nothing but does not cease to speak must become power to name in him alone who hears it, who
is nothing but attunement to it, a mediator capable of informing it. Likewise, he who listens, the
"reader," is he by whom the work is spoken anew. Not respoken in an interminable repetition,
but maintained in its decisiveness as a new, an initial word.

Hence the dependence of the artist with regard to the work. The strange character of inspiration
is linked to this essential anteriority of the poem with respect to the poet. He feels, both in his life
and in his work, that he is still to come, still absent when faced with the work which is itself
altogether future, the presence and celebration of the future. This dependence is essential. The
poet exists only poetically, as the possibility of the poem. And, in this sense, he only exists after
it, although he stands uniquely before it. Inspiration is not the gift of the poem to someone
existing already, but the gift of existence to someone who does not yet exist. And this existence
is manifest as that which keeps steadfastly and altogether outside (hence the separation named
above), in the permanent leave of absence granted to the self, to every subjective certainty and to
the world's truth.
To say that the poet only exists after the poem means that he receives his "reality" from the
poem, but that he does not dispose of this reality except in order to make the poem possible. In
this sense he does not survive the creation of the work. He lives by dying in it. This also means
that the finished poem regards him with indifference; it does not refer to him. He is by no means
entitled to be cited and glorified by the poem as its origin. For what is glorified by the work is
the work, or art, which the work holds concentrated in itself. And the creator is the one who from
then on is dismissed, whose name is erased and whose memory fades. This also means that the
creator has no power over his work, that he is dispossessed by it, that in it he is dispossessed of
himself. He does not hold its meaning, its privileged secret. It is not incumbent upon him to
"read" the poem -- that is, to pronounce it anew, to speak it each time as new. 
Author and reader are equals with respect to the work and in it. Both are unique. Neither has any
existence except through this work and based upon it. The author is not the author in general of
various poems, nor is the reader a reader who has a taste for poetry and understands all the great
poetic works one after the other. Rather, both are unique. This means that the reader is no less
"unique" than the author. For he as well is the one who, each time, speaks the poem as if afresh,
not as an echo of the already spoken and already understood.
The Work Says: Beginning
The work, which we identify as the reciprocity in struggle of "the being who projects and the
being who contains" (he who hears and he

who speaks it), bears within itself the principle that so determines it. This principle lies in the
work's torn intimacy: it is the first day of all and yet that very dawn always recaptured by the
opaque profundity. This presence of being, the work, is an event. This event does not come to
pass outside of time any more than the work is simply spiritual. Rather, through the work there
takes place in time another time, and in the world of beings that exist and of things which subsist
there comes, as presence, not another world, but the other of all worlds, that which is always
other than the world.
It is in view of this claim that the question of the work and its historical duration can be
approached. The work is a thing among others, which men use, in which they take interest, of
which they make a means and an object of knowledge, of culture and even of vanity. In this
capacity the work has a history, and scholars, cultivated men of taste consider it important. They
study it, its history, and the history of art which it represents. But in this capacity it is also
nothing more than an object, which finally has no value except to our concern for achievements,
whose knowledge is a mere form.
The work is not a work when it is only an interesting object of study, a product among other
products. In this sense, it has no history. The work is not history's business; rather, history makes
it the business of professionals. And yet the work is history; it is an event, the event of history
itself, and this is because its most steadfast claim is to give to the word beginning all its force.
Malraux writes, "The work speaks on one day a language it will never speak again, that of its
birth." But we must add this: what it says is not only what it is at the moment of being born,
when it begins. Always it says, in one guise or another: beginning. It is thus that history belongs
to it and that nevertheless it escapes history. In the world where it emerges to proclaim that now
there is a work -- in the usual time, that is, of current truths -- it emerges as the unaccustomed,
the unwonted, that which has no relation to this world or with this time. Never is it affirmed on
the basis of familiar, present reality. It takes away what is most familiar to us. And always it is in
excess: it is the superfluity of what always lacks. We have called this excess poverty the
superabundance of refusal.
The work says this word, beginning, and what it claims to give to history is initiative, the
possibility of a point of departure. But for its own part it does not begin. It is always anterior to
any beginning, it is always already finished. As soon as the truth one thinks one draws from it
comes to light, becomes the life and the action of daytime's clarity, 

the work closes in on itself as if it were a foreigner to this truth and without significance. For the
work seems a stranger not only with respect to truths already known and certain; it is not only the
scandal of the monstrous and of the nontrue; it always refutes the true, whatever it may be. Even
if truth be drawn from the work, the work overturns it, takes it back into itself to bury and hide it.
And yet the work says the work beginning and it matters greatly to the day. It is the dawning
light that precedes the day. It initiates, it enthrones. "Mystery which enthrones," says Char. But in
itself it remains mysterious, excluded from the initiation and exiled from the clear truth.
In this sense the work is always original and at all moments a beginning. It is thus that it appears
ever new, the mirage of the future's inaccessible truth. And it is new "now," it renews this "now"
which it seems to initiate, to render more immediate. And finally it is very old, frightfully
ancient, lost in the night of time. It is the origin which always precedes us and is always given
before us, for it is the approach of what allows us to depart -- a thing of the past, in a different
sense from what Hegel said.
The Dialectic of the Work
Only if it is torn unity, always in struggle, never pacified, is the work a work. And only when it
becomes light shining from the dark, the unfurling of that which remains closed, is it this torn
intimacy. He who, as creator, produces the work by making it present, and the other who, as
reader, abides with it to re-produce it, form one aspect of this opposition. But already they
elaborate upon it, and they also stabilize it, by subsituting for the exalting contradiction the
certainty of separated powers, always ready to forget that they are real only in the exaltation that
unites by tearing them asunder. Because it cannot sustain within itself the antagonism which
unifies by splitting, the work bears the principle of its ruin. And what ruins it is that it seems true.
For from this semblance of truth is drawn an active truth and an inactive illusion which is called
the beautiful. From this disjunction on, the work becomes a more or less effective reality and an
esthetic object.
The reader who is not only a reader but lives and pursues a livelihood in a world where the clear
daytime truth is a necessity believes that the work holds the moment of truth within it. But with
respect to the truth attributed to it, the work is always what precedes. And it is in this regard
always the nontrue, the no in which the true

originates. The reader sees in the marvelous clarity of the work, not that which is brought to light
by the darkness that withholds it and that hides in it, but that which is clear in itself -- meaning:
that which is understood and can be taken from the work, separated from it to be enjoyed and
used. Thus the reader's dialogue with the work consists increasingly in "raising" it to truth, in
transforming it into ordinary language, effective formulae, useful values. The dilettante and the
critic, on the other hand, devote themselves to the "beauties" of the work, to its esthetic value;
and they believe, as they busy themselves about this empty shell which they consider a
disinterested object of interest, that they still partake of the work's reserve.
This transformation is necessarily accomplished at the moment when history becomes purposeful
action through and through, commitment to a realized goal. 
The Work and the Sacred
But one can also see why it is that in the periods when man is not yet present to himself and
when it is the inhuman, the nonpresent, the divine that is present and activating, the work is very
close to fulfillment of its requirements, and yet is also hidden and as if unrecognized. When art is
the language of the gods, when the temple is the house where the god dwells, the work is
invisible and art unknown. The poem names the sacred, and men hear the sacred, not the poem.
And yet the poem names the sacred as unnamable; in this silence it speaks the unspeakable. "The
branch of the first sun" is wrapped and hidden in the song. The poet transmits it veiled, so that
"the fire not seen, undecomposable," might become our common origin ( René Char). The poem
is thus the veil which makes the fire visible, which reveals it precisely by veiling and concealing
it. The poem shows, then; it discloses, but by concealing, because it detains in the dark that
which can only be revealed in the light of darkness and keeps this mystery dark even in the light
which the dark makes the first dawn of all. The poem is effaced before the sacred which it
names; it is the silence that brings to the word the god that speaks in silence -- but since the
divine is unspeakable and ever speechless, the poem, through the silence of the god which it
encloses in language, is also that which speaks as poem, and shows itself, as a work, at the same
time that it remains hidden.
The work is thus both hidden in the god's profound presence and visible through the absence and
obscurity of the divine. And thus it is

the torn intimacy of its own essence. And what it says, when it names the sacred, is the battle of
subterranean divinities -- the Furies, the "dishonored daughters of Night" -- against the gods of
light who, in men's name, become guardians of justice. This combat is the struggle of the work's
essence itself. And if, through the centuries, art returns from time to time to such myths, this is
because it is present there and because there it is present alone, under the veil of the divine.
It seems that there is, with the passage of time, something like a "dialectic" of the work and a
transformation of the sense of art. This movement does not correspond to determined historical
periods, but it is nevertheless related to different historical forms. Limiting ourselves to a rather
imprecise outline, we could say that it is according to this dialectic that the work moves from the
erected stone, from the rhythmic and hymnlike cry where it announces the divine and makes the
gods real, to the statue where it gives them form, to the productions in which it represents men,
before becoming a figure of itself.
Concern for the Origin
The work moves thus from gods to men. It contributes to this movement; for always it
pronounces the word beginning in a way which is more original than are the worlds, the powers
which borrow that word in order to become manifest or to act. Even its alliance with the gods, to
whom the work seems so close, is ruinous for the gods. In the work they speak, in the temple
they dwell, but the work is also the silence of the gods; it is the oracle where the mystery of the
god's silence becomes a mysterious language and the mystery of language. And in the temple the
god dwells, but dwells hidden, absent with an impressive absence whose sacred space,
manifested by the work -- itself at once visible and invisible -- is an ambiguous affirmation. The
work bespeaks the divine, but only inasmuch as the divine is unspeakable. The work is the 
presence of the god's absence, and in this absence it tends to make itself present: to become, not
Zeus any more, but statue, and no longer the real combat of the Furies and the gods of light, but
inspired tragedy. And when the gods are overthrown, the temple does not disappear with them,
but, rather, begins to appear. It reveals itself by continuing to be what it was from the first only
unknowingly: the abode of the gods' absence.
The work is no less dangerous for man. Having subtracted from it the prestige and the immensity
of the sacred, he wants to maintain it at his own level, and to affirm himself in it as mastery,
success, the happy

and reasoned accomplishment of purposeful activity. It soon appears that the work of art is by no
means mastered by mastery, that it has to do no less with failure than with success, that it is not a
thing one can achieve by perseverance, that effort is not honored in it, even when it demands
effort, but profoundly denatured. In the work man speaks, but the work gives voice in man to
what does not speak: to the unnamable, the inhuman, to what is devoid of truth, bereft of justice,
without rights. Here man does not recognize himself; he does not feel justified. No longer is he
present, either as man for himself, or before God, or as a god before himself.
Each time the work communicates, behind the gods or in men's name, it is as if to announce a
greater beginning. If the gods seem to hold the keys of the origin, if they appear to be the
primordial powers from which all emanates, the work, at the same time that it gives them voice,
says something more original than they, says their default which is their Destiny -- says, before
Destiny, the shadow where it subsists making no sign and powerless.
The work was once the language of the gods, their absence's speech; subsequently it was the just,
the balanced language of men, and then the language of men in their diversity. Then again it was
the language of disinherited men, of those who do not speak. And then it was the language of
what does not speak in men, of the secret, of despair or ravishment. What is left now for the
work to say? What has always eluded its language? Itself. When all has been said, when the
world comes into its own as the truth of the whole, when history wants to culminate in the
conclusion of discourse -- when the work has nothing more to say and disappears -- it is then that
it tends to become the language of the work. In the work that has disappeared the work wants to
speak, and the experience of the work becomes the search for its essence, the affirmation of art,
concern for the origin.
Here again, then, we come to grips with the question that art asks of us today; but we also grasp
what is dangerous and precarious in this tendency to come directly into the daylight, this
inclination of the work to emerge and make itself visible and present not only in itself but in the
experience from which it is born. For what has the outline we have used shown us? What has this
grid made visible? Only this: that art is constantly invisible to us. That it is always anterior to
what it speaks of and to itself. Nothing is more striking than this movement which always hides
the work and makes it all the more powerful in that it is less manifest. It is as if a secret law
required of the work that it always be concealed

in what it shows and thus that it only show what must remain concealed, and that finally it only
show what must stay hidden by concealing it. Why is art so intimately allied with the sacred? It
is because in the relation between art and the sacred, between that which shows itself and that
which does not -- in the movement whereby disclosure and dissimulation change places without
cease, appealing and reaching to each other where, nevertheless, they are realized only as the
approach of the unreachable -- the work finds the profound reserve which it needs. It is hidden
and preserved by the presence of the god, manifest and apparent through the obscurity of the
divine, and again kept safe in reserve by this obscurity and this distance which constitutes its
space and to which it gives rise as though thus to come into the light. It is this remove that
permits the work to address the world and at the same time to reserve comment, to be the ever
reserved beginning of every story. That is why, when the gods depart, it is not only the sense of
what made it speak which threatens to fail the work but something much more important: the
intimacy of its reserve, the remove which today it cannot locate elsewhere, as it did before the
modern age, in nature's secrets, in the obscurity of the world still incompletely explored, not yet
altogether explicit.
What will become now of art, now that the gods and even their absence are gone, and now that
man's presence offers no support? For at present man no longer belongs to art, committed as he
is to selfrealization, which is to say to freeing himself from nature and from being through
productive undertakings and effective action. And where will art find, elsewhere than in the
divine, elsewhere than in the world, the space in which to base and to withhold itself? This too is
the question which awakens the work to the experience of its origin, as if, in the search for art,
whose essence has become its concern, it hoped henceforth to find its basis and its remove.

The Original Experience
Investigations on the subject of art such as those the esthetician pursues bear no relation to the
concern for the work of which we speak. Esthetics talks about art, makes of it an object of
reflection and of knowledge. Esthetics explains art by reducing it or then again exalts by
elucidating it, but in all events art for the esthetician is a present reality around which he
constructs plausible thoughts at no risk.
The work is deeply concerned for art. This is to say that for the work, art is never a given, and
that the work can find art only by continuing toward its own completion in radical uncertainty,
for it cannot know in advance whether art is what it is. As long as the work can serve art by
serving other values, these permit the work to find art without having to seek it, and indeed allow
that the finding not even be an issue. A work inspired by faith need not (and should not) trouble
about itself. It bears witness to this faith, and if it does so poorly, if it fails, faith is not affected.
Today the work has no faith other than itself. And this faith is absolute passion for that which
depends upon the work alone to give it life. Yet the work by itself can discover only the absence
of art. Perhaps the work has the power to present art, but only if it hides from itself that it is
seeking by seeking art where the impossible preserves it. And because of this, when the work
takes itself to be the task of grasping art in its essence, the impossible is its task, and the work is
only realized as an infinite searching. For the characteristic most proper to the origin is to be
always veiled by that of which it is the origin. 
In advance of a particular work, does art not exist in other works which have already provided
illustrious examples? Did Cézanne not think he encountered it in the Venetian paintings at the
Louvre? If Rilke honors Hölderlin, does he not count on him for the certainty that

the poem, that poetry exists? Perhaps Cézanne knows that art dwells in Venice, but the work of
Cézanne does not know this. Cézanne spoke of realization, the supreme quality, and believed
that thus he represented to himself the essence of Venetian art. But his work cannot hold this
"realization" to be essential except by achieving it.
Doubtless one can conceive of such seeking, and describe it and trace the successive steps in
what seems to us to be artistic creation. Malraux, for example, has shown that the artist becomes
aware of his future work by living in that embodied consciousness of art, so to speak, which the
Museum is for him, and which is art, not immobilized in its particular manifestations, but
perceived in the changes which make of given works moments in an actual duration, and of art
the always incomplete sense of such a movement. This is a significant idea, but mainly it helps
us to understand or to imagine how the work is always lacking with respect to itself. For the
implication is that, without the collection of all the works which incarnate it in time, art does not
exist, yet that art is "true" only in the work always still to come.
The habits of thought which we owe to the commonplaces of subjective art lead us to believe
that the artist or writer seeks to express himself and that for him what is missing from the
Museum and from literature is he. What torments him, what he strives to fashion into a work, is
said to be this expression of himself which he forms by means of an artistic technique.
Is Cézanne's concern to express himself, to give to art, that is, one more artist? He "swore to die
painting." Was that just in order to live on? Does he sacrifice himself in this passion which
knows no happiness simply so that his paintings might give form to the singular weather of his
soul? This much no one can doubt: what he seeks has only one name. Painting. But painting can
be found only in the work currently in progress, which demands that he himself exist only in it,
and of which all his canvases are only traces, along an infinite road yet to be discovered.
Leonardo da Vinci is another example of this passion which wants to raise the work to the
essence of art and which finally perceives in each work only an inconclusive step along the path
of a search which we too recognize in the unfinished canvases, the pictures which seem open:
this path is now the only essential work. We would certainly misconstrue Leonardo's destiny if
we saw him as a painter who did not put his art above everything. He made painting an absolute.
Yet it is not his judgments that reveal this to us, not even when he defines painting as "the
greatest spiritual process." It is rather his anguish, that fright

which seized him each time he put himself in front of a canvas. Because of conditions proper to
the Renaissance, the search led Leonardo out of painting. But his was a search for art and art
alone. The terror of having to realize the unrealizable, the anguish of painting, caused the search
to evolve into forgetfulness of what was sought and into the exploration of a pure, useless
knowledge in order that the frightful moment of realization become always more distant until the
day when, in his notes, this revealing assertion was inscribed: "One must not desire the 
impossible." But why is the impossible what the work desires when it has become concern for its
own origin?
Risk
In one of Rilke's letters, addressed to Clara Rilke, we find this answer: "Works of art are always
the products of a danger incurred, of an experience pursued to the end, to the point where man
can no longer continue." The work of art is linked to a risk; it is the affirmation of an extreme
experience. But what is this risk? What is the nature of the bond that unites the work to risk?
From the point of view of the work (from the point of view of the requirements which
characterize it and which we have described), we clearly see that it demands a sacrifice of him
who makes it possible. The poet belongs to the poem; he belongs to it only insofar as he keeps to
this free belonging. This relation is not simply the formal devotion which nineteenth-century
writers stress. When it is said of the writer that he must live only in order to write well, or of the
artist that he must sacrifice everything to the demands of his art, the perilous urgency, the
prodigality of the risk which informs the artist's relation to the work is not expressed at all. The
scholar too gives himself entirely to his scholarly task. And morality in general, the call of duty,
pronounce the same fanatical decree, ultimately calling upon the individual to sacrifice himself
and to perish. But the work is not such an unambiguous value demanding of us that we exhaust
ourselves for its sake, for love of it, or out of fidelity to the goal it represents to us. If the artist
runs a risk, it is because the work itself is essentially a risk. By belonging to the work, it is
likewise to risk that he belongs.
In one of the Sonnets to Orpheus, Rilke summons us with these words:
We, we infinitely risked.
Why infinitely? Man is the most precarious of all beings, for he jeopardizes

himself. The construction of a world, the transformation of nature through productive activity,
only succeeds because of a daring challenge in the course of which everything easy is
discounted. However, the goal of a protected, a satisfied and secure life also finds expression in
this audacity. Precise tasks and reasonable obligations also speak. Man risks his life, but he does
so under the protection of the familiar light of day, in view of the useful, the beneficial, and the
true. Sometimes, in revolution, in war, under the pressure of history's development he risks his
world, but he always does so in the name of a greater possibility, in order to reduce what exceeds
his grasp, protect what he is, ensure the values to which his power is attached -- in a word, to
domesticate the day and extend it or verify it insofar as is possible.
What is the risk proper to the work when the work has the essence of art for its task? But is such
a question not surprising in itself? Doesn't the artist appear to be free of life's burdens, and to
bear no responsibility for what he creates? Does he not seem to live at his pleasure in the
imaginary where, were he to run a risk, it would still be nothing but an image?
Exile
This is true. When Saint-John Perse named one of his poems Exile, he named the poetic
condition as well. The poet is in exile; he is exiled from the city, from regular occupations and 
limited obligations, from everything connected to results, substantive reality, power. The
outward aspect of the risk to which the work exposes him is precisely its inoffensive appearance.
The poem is inoffensive, which is to say that whoever submits to it is deprived of himself as
power, consents to be cast out from his own capability and from all forms of possibility.
The poem is exile, and the poet who belongs to it belongs to the dissatisfaction of exile. He is
always lost to himself, outside, far from home; he belongs to the foreign, to the outside which
knows no intimacy or limit, and to the separation which Hölderlin names when in his madness he
sees rhythm's infinite space.
Exile, the poem then, makes the poet a wanderer, the one always astray, he to whom the stability
of presence is not granted and who is deprived of a true abode. And this must be understood in
the gravest sense: the artist does not belong to truth because the work is itself what escapes the
movement of the true. For always, whatever our perspective upon it, it revokes the true, eludes
signification, designating that region where nothing subsists, where what takes place has
nevertheless

not taken place, where what begins over has never begun. It points into the realm of the most
dangerous indecision, toward the confusion from which nothing emerges. This eternal outside is
quite well evoked by the image of the exterior darkness where man withstands that which the
true must negate in order to become possibility and progress.
Error is the risk which awaits the poet and which, behind him, awaits every man who writes
dependent upon an essential work. Error means wandering, the inability to abide and stay. For
where the wanderer is, the conditions of a definitive here are lacking. In this absence of here and
now what happens does not clearly come to pass as an event based upon which something solid
could be achieved. Consequently, what happens does not happen, but does not pass either, into
the past; it is never passed. It happens and recurs without cease; it is the horror and the confusion
and the uncertainty of eternal repetition. It is not one truth or another that lacks, or truth in
general; nor is it doubt that leads us on or despair that immobilizes us. The wanderer's country is
not truth, but exile; he lives outside, on the other side which is by no means a beyond, rather the
contrary. He remains separated, where the deep of dissimulation reigns, that elemental obscurity
through which no way can be made and which because of that makes its awful way through him.
What man risks when he belongs to the work and when the work is the search for art is, then, the
most extreme thing he could risk: not just his life, not only the world where he dwells, but his
essence, his right to truth, and, even more, his right to death. He departs; he becomes, as
Hölderlin calls him, the migrator -- he who, like the priests of Dionysos, wanders from country
to country in the sacred night. This errant migration can sometimes lead him to insignificance, to
the facile contentment of a life crowned with approval, the platitudes of honorific
irresponsibility. Sometimes it leads him into wretched vagrancy which is only the instability of a
life bereft of a work. And sometimes it takes him to the deep where everything wavers, where
everything meaningful is undermined, destabilized, where this upheaval ruins the work and hides
in forgetfulness. 
In the poem it is not any particular individual who risks himself alone, or a particular mind that is
exposed to the touch and the burn of darkness. The risk is more essential. It is the danger of
dangers by which, each time, the essence of language is radically placed in doubt. To risk
language: this is one of the forms of this risk. To risk being -- the

word uttered when absence is spoken, and which the work pronounces by pronouncing the word
beginning -- this is the other form of the risk. In the work of art, being is risked. For whereas in
the world where beings repel it in order to be, being is always concealed, negated, and denied
(and thus protected too), in dissimulation's realm that which is concealed tends, on the contrary,
to emerge, deep down in appearance, and that which is negated becomes the excess in
affirmation. But this appearance reveals nothing, nothing is affirmed by this affirmation which is
only the unstable position from which, if the work succeeds in containing it, the true will be able
to take place.
The work draws light from the dark; it is a relation with what admits of no relations; it
encounters being before the encounter is possible and where truth lacks. This is the essential risk.
Here we reach the abyss. Here we bind ourselves, with a bond which cannot be too strong, to the
nontrue, and to it we seek to bind an essential form of authenticity. This is what Nietzsche
suggests when he says, "We have art so as not to go under [touch the bottom] on account of
truth." 4
He does not mean, as a superficial interpretation would have it, that art is the illusion which
protects us against the mortal truth. He says with more certainty: we have art in order that what
makes us go all the way to the bottom not belong to the domain of truth. The very bottom, the
bottomless abyss belongs to art. And art is that deep which is sometimes the absence of
profundity, of the foundation, the pure void bereft of importance, and sometimes that upon which
a foundation can be given, but it is also always at the same time one and the other, the
intertwining of the Yes and of the No, the ebb and flow of the essential ambiguity. And that is
why all works of art and all literary works seem to leave comprehension behind and yet seem
never to reach it, so that it must be said of them that they are always understood too much and
always too little.
Let us try to investigate with more precision what happens to us because "we have art." And
what is necessary in order that we have art? What is the meaning of this possibility? We still
barely glimpse the implications of such questions, which have arisen in the work only since it
has had art's essence for its task. And do we have art? The question remains undecided from the
moment, precisely, when what must speak in the work is its origin.

"Wir haben die Kunst, damit wir nicht an der Wahrheit zu Grunde gehen."

The Radical Reversal
When a contemporary philosopher names death as man's extreme possibility, the possibility
absolutely proper to him, he shows that the origin of possibility is linked in man to the fact that
he can die, that for him death is yet one possibility more, that the event by which man departs 
from the possible and belongs to the impossible is nevertheless within his mastery, that it is the
extreme moment of his possibility. (And this the philosopher expresses precisely by saying of
death that it is "the possibility of impossibility.") 5 Hegel had already seen action, language,
liberty, and death to be aspects of one and the same movement; he had shown that only man's
constant and resolute proximity to death allows him to become active nothingness capable of
negating and transforming natural reality -- of combating, of laboring, of knowing, and of being
historical. This is a magical force: it is the absolute power of the negative which becomes the
action of truth in the world. It brings negation to reality, form to the formless, definition to the
indefinite. We want to draw these limits, mark these ends, come to the finish. That is the
principle behind civilization's demands, the essence of the purposeful will which seeks
achievement, which demands accomplishment and attains universal mastery. Existence is
authentic when it is capable of enduring possibility right up to its extreme point, able to stride
toward death as toward possibility par excellence. It is to this movement that the essence of man
in Western history owes its having become action, value, future, labor and truth. The affirmation
that in man all is possibility requires that death itself be possible: death itself, without which man
would not be able to form the notion of an "all" or to exist in view of a totality, must be what
makes all -- what makes totality -- possible.
But what is art, and what can we say of literature? The question returns now with a particular
violence. If we have art -- which is exile from truth, which is the risk of an inoffensive game,
which affirms man's belonging to the limitless outside where intimacy is unknown, where he is
banished from his capability and from all forms of possibility -how does this come about? How,
if he is altogether possibility, can man allow himself anything resembling art? If he has art, does
this not mean that, contrary to his apparently authentic definition -- the requirement

Emmanuel Levinas is the first to have brought out what was at stake in this expression ( Time
and the Other).

which is in harmony with the law of the day -- he entertains with death a relation which is not
that of possibility, which does not lead to mastery or to understanding or to the progressive
achievements of time, but exposes him to a radical reversal? This reversal: would it not seem to
be the original experience which the work must touch, upon which it closes and which
constantly threatens to close in upon art and withhold it? The end, in this perspective, would no
longer be that which gives man the power to end -- to limit, separate, and thus to grasp -- but the
infinite: the dreadful infinitude on account of which the end can never be overcome. Death, then,
would not be "the possibility absolutely proper to man," my own death, that unique event which
answers Rilke's prayer: "O Lord, grant to each his own death," but on the contrary, that which
never happens to me, so that never do I die, but rather "they die." Men die always other than
themselves, at the level of the neutrality and the impersonality of the eternal They.
The characteristics of this reversal can only be recalled briefly here.
They die: this is not a reassuring formula designed to put off the fearsome moment. They die: he
who dies is anonymous, and anonymity is the guise in which the ungraspable, the unlimited, the
unsituated is most dangerously affirmed among us. Whoever experiences this suffers an
anonymous, impersonal force, the force of an event which, being the dissolution of every event, 
is starting over not only now, but was in its very beginning a beginning again. And in its domain
everything that happens happens over again. From the instant "they die," the instant is revoked.
When someone dies, "when" designates not a particular date but no matter what date. Likewise
there is a level of this experience at which death reveals its nature by appearing no longer as the
demise of a particular person, or as death in general, but in this neutral form: someone or other's
death. Death is always nondescript. Hence the feeling that the special signs of affection which
those who were close to a person recently departed still show him are out of place. For now there
is no more distinction to be made between close and distant. The only appropriate tears are
impersonal ones, the general sadness of official mourners delegated by the indifference of the
They. Death is public. If this does not mean that it is the sheer exteriorization which the
spectacular side of death as ceremony expresses, one feels nonetheless at such spectacles how
much death becomes indistinct and unmasterable error, the shifty point from which
indetermination condemns time to the exhausting futility of repetition.

The Experience of Art
To the poet, to the artist this summons makes itself heard: "Be dead evermore in Eurydice."6
 This
dramatic command apparently implies a reassuring other half: Be dead evermore in Eurydice so
as to be alive in Orpheus. Art brings duplicity with it. This duplicity allows it to escape its own
risk. It can always extricate itself by transforming the risk into security. Then it partakes of the
world -- of the world's successes and advantages -- without incurring its obligations. Thus does
art plunge into the other risk, the one which is without danger, which signifies only the
unperceived loss of art, brilliant insignificance, tranquil talk wreathed in honors.
The duplicity cannot be outdone. But it must be suffered in all its depth. The duplicity of the
happy dream which invites us to die sadly in Eurydice so as to survive gloriously in Orpheus is
concealment concealing itself; it is forgetfulness profoundly forgotten. Yet behind this facile
forgetting which arranges for us to obtain the satisfactions of glory, the fundamental duplicity is
at work as well. It detaches us from all power. Now the happy dream is not so happy: it turns into
a nightmare, it falls away in confusion and misery. The inessential, the complacent lightness
becomes the unbearable loss of essence; beauty withers into error, error opens onto exile -- onto
migration outside, where there is neither intimacy nor rest. Be dead evermore in Eurydice. Yes,
such is the call, such the command. But deep in this order "dead evermore" is echoed by "alive
forever," and here "alive" does not signify life, but -- in the guise of a reassuring ambiguity -- the
loss of the power to die, the loss of death as power and possibility. It signifies the essential
sacrifice: the radical reversal which Rilke, who perhaps always sought to outwit it, expresses
without grasping all the implications of what he writes, in a letter of January 6, 1923. He asks to
see no longer in death something negative, but "das Wort Tod ohne Negation zu lesen." To read
the word death without negation is to withdraw from it the cutting edge of decision and the
power to negate; it is to cut oneself off from possibility and the true, but also from death as true
event. It is to surrender to the indistinct and the undetermined, to the emptiness anterior to
events, where the end has all the heaviness of starting over.
This experience is the experience of art. Art -- as images, as words, and as rhythm -- indicates
the menacing proximity of a vague and vacant
 
7Rilke, Sonnets to Orpheus, XII, Pt. 2.

outside, a neutral existence, nil and limitless; art points into a sordid absence, a suffocating
condensation where being ceaselessly perpetuates itself as nothingness.
Art is originally linked to this fund of impotence where everything falls back when the possible
is attenuated. In the world, decisive affirmation dependably serves truth as a basis and
foundation, as the place from which it can arise. By comparison, art originally represents the
scandalous intimation of absolute error: the premonition of something not true but whose "not"
does not have the decisive character of a limit, for it is, rather, brimming and endless
indeterminacy with which the true cannot communicate. Nor does truth by any means have the
power to reconquer it. The true cannot define itself vis-à-vis this "not" except by becoming the
violence of the negative.
If the essential task of the true is to negate, this is because error affirms in the profuse plenitude
which is its preserve outside of time and in all times. This affirmation is the perpetuity of what
admits neither of beginning nor of end. It is neither productive nor destructive but stagnant; it is
that which has never come, which is neither staunched nor spurting forth but coming back -- the
eternal lapping of return. It is in this sense that in art's milieu there is a pact contracted with
death, with repetition, and with failure. Beginning again, repetition, the fatal return -- everything
evoked by experiences where estrangement is allied with the strangely familiar, where the
irremediable takes the form of an endless repetition, where the same is posed in the dizziness of
redoubling, where there is no cognition but only recognition -- all this alludes to that initial error
which might be expressed as follows: what is first is not beginning, but beginning over, and
being is precisely the impossibility of being for the first time.
One could bring this movement more sharply into focus -- but not explain it -- by evoking those
forms and those crises called "complexes." Their essence is that at the moment they come about
they have already done so: they only ever return. This is their characteristic feature. They are the
experience of beginning again. "Again, again!" is the cry of anguish struggling with the
irremediable, with being. Again, again, such is the closed wound of the complex. It takes place
again, it recurs, yet another time. The basis of failure lies, not in the fact that an experience meets
with no success, but in its beginning all over again. Everything begins again always -- yes, one
more time, again, again.
Some time ago now, Freud, surprised by the tendency to repeat, the powerful call of the anterior,
recognized in it the call of death itself.

But perhaps what must finally come out is this: he who seeks in death the meaning of repetition
is also led to ruin death as possibility -- to bind it in repetition's spell. Yes, we are tied to disaster,
but when failure returns, it must be understood as nothing but the return. The power that begins
everything over again is older than the beginning: this is the error of our death.
A Return to the Question 
We come here to the point where the question which has been asked of us makes the
contradiction, to which every answer returns, emerge in all its force. What the work says is the
word beginning. But today the work is the work of art: art is its starting point. And it says "the
beginning" when it says "art," which is its origin and whose essence has become its task. But
where has art led us? To a time before the world, before the beginning. It has cast us out of our
power to begin and to end; it has turned us toward the outside where there is no intimacy, no
place to rest. It has led us into the infinite migration of error. For we seek art's essence, and it lies
where the nontrue admits of nothing essential. We appeal to art's sovereignty: it ruins the
kingdom. It ruins the origin by returning to it the errant immensity of directionless eternity. The
work says the word beginning from a starting point -- art -- which is complicit with the futility of
starting over. The work declares being -- and says choice, mastery, form -- by announcing art
which says the fatality of being, says passivity and formless prolixity. At the very moment of the
choice art still holds us back in a primordial Yes and No. There, before any beginning, the
somber ebb and flow of dissimulation rumbles.
Such is the question. It asks not to be overcome. That the work is able to pronounce the work
beginning precisely because the origin attracts it to the place where it risks utter ruin, and
because, precisely, it must escape with a leap the implacable insistence of something having
neither beginning nor end: this might well be said. And likewise this: that the work is this leap
and that it immobilizes itself mysteriously between the truth which does not belong to it and the
prolixity of the unrevealable which would prevent it from belonging to itself -- that it hovers
between death as the possibility of understanding and death as the horror of impossibility.
Moreover, the work's successful completion so close to the indefinite and the formless glorifies
the proportion in it and makes its coherence, exactitude, and limit all the more impressive.
Indeed, all this can be said. And it would all form the elements of an

answer. But what does the answer mean as long as in it there remains this question: Do we have
art? To this query there can be no decisive answer, at least not to the extent that the work's origin
is its concern and that its task is the essence of what verges on the inessential.
We asked ourselves: "Why, when history contests it, does art tend to become essential
presence?" What does this presence mean? Is it only the artistic form of what contests art, the
affirmation of art's poverty reversed? Or does the desolate voice which asks, "What use are poets
in time of distress?" -- does the distress toward which this question points mysteriously --
express the essence of art more profoundly, so that in such a presence art could no longer be
anything, save its own absence? But what is the time of distress?
This expression is borrowed from the elegy Bread and Wine by Hölderlin:
In these times, very often it seems to me
Better to sleep than to be so without companions
And to wait so; what is there to do in these times, what to say?
I do not know; what use are poets in time of distress?7
What is this time during which, as René Char says as well, "the sole certainty which we possess
of tomorrow's reality . . . the perfected form of the secret where we come to refresh ourselves, 
take precautions and sleep"? What is this time when poetry can only say: what use are poets?
The elegy answers us with these other lines which precede a bit those we have just cited:
From time to time man bears the divine plenitude.
A dream of these times, that is what life is afterwards. But error
Helps, like sleep, and distress makes us strong as does night.
It seems that art owes the strangest of torments and the very grave passion that animate it to the
disappearance of the historical forms of the divine. Art was the language of the gods. The gods
having disappeared, it became the language in which their disappearance was ex-

In dürftiger Zeit. The German expression is tougher and drier than the French [au temps de
détresse]. It announces that toughness, that rigor with which the late Hölderlin defends
himself against his yearning for the gods who have withdrawn, and maintains the distinction
between the spheres -- the one above and the one here below. With this distinction, Hölderlin
maintains the purity of the sacred realm left empty by the double infidelity of men and gods.
For the sacred is this very void, the sheer void of the interval which must be kept pure and
empty according to the ultimate requirement: "Preserve God with the purity of what
distinguishes." (On this subject, which is central, see in the Appendixes the pages entitled
Hölderlin's Itinerary.)

pressed, then the language in which this disappearance itself ceased to appear. This forgetfulness
now speaks all alone. The deeper the forgetfulness, the more the deep speaks in this language,
and the more the abyss of this deepness can become the hearing of the word.
Forgetting, error, the unhappiness of erring can be linked to an historical period: to the time of
distress when the gods are absent twice over, because they are no longer there, because they are
not there yet. This vacant time is that of error, where we do nothing but err because we lack the
certitude of presence and the conditions of a true here. And nevertheless error helps us, "das
Irrsal hilft." Elsewhere, in the variant of the poem Dichterberuf, Hölderlin says likewise that
God's lack, his default helps us: "Gottes Fehl hilft." What does this mean?
The force, the risk proper to the poet is to dwell in God's default, the region where truth lacks.
The time of distress designates the time which in all times is proper to art. But when historically
the gods lack and the world of truth wavers, the time of distress emerges in the work as concern -
- the concern in which the work finds its preserve -- threatening it: making it present and visible.
The time of art is the time before time. The collective presence of the divine evokes this time by
hiding it; history and the productive movement of history revoke it by denying it, and the work
shows it, in the distress of the What use? as that which hides deep down in appearance, reappears
in the heart of disappearance, comes to pass in the proximity and under the threat of a radical
reversal, the reversal at work when "they die." Perpetuating being in the form of nothingness,
this reversal changes light into fascination, the object into the image, and it makes us into the
empty center of eternal repetition.
And yet "error helps us." It is the intimation in waiting, the deep of sleep keeping watch, the
silent void of sacred memory. The poet is the intimacy of distress. He alone profoundly lives the 
empty time of absence, and in him error becomes straying's profundity, night becomes the other
night. But what does this mean? When René Char writes, "May risk light your way"; when
Georges Bataille, comparing fortune and poetry says, "The absence of poetry is misfortune";
when Hölderlin calls the empty, distressful present "bountiful suffering, bountiful happiness,"
what is seeking to express itself in these words? Why should our light come from risk? Why
should the time of distress be the fortunate time? When Hölderlin speaks of poets who, like the
priests of Bacchus, go wandering from country to country in the sacred night, is this perpetual
departure, the sorrow of straying which has no

place to arrive, to rest, also the fecund migration, the movement which mediates, that which
makes of rivers a language and of language the dwelling, the power by which day abides and is
our abode?
So then, is the work really the marvel of the beginning, in which error's indefiniteness would
preserve us from inauthenticity's fraud? And is the nontrue an essential form of authenticity? 8
In
that case, we do, then, have the work? We have art?
To this question there can be no response. The poem is the answer's absence. The poet is one
who, through his sacrifice, keeps the question open in his work. At every time he lives the time
of distress, and his time is always the empty time when what he must live is the double infidelity:
that of men, that of the gods -- and also the double absence of the gods who are no longer and
who are not yet. The poem's space is entirely represented by this and, which indicates the double
absence, the separation at its most tragic instant. But as for whether it is the and that unites and
binds together, the pure word in which the void of the past and the void of the future become true
presence, the "now" of dawn -- this question is reserved in the work. It is that which reveals itself
in the work by returning to concealment, to the distress of forgetting. That is why the poem is
solitude's poverty. This solitude is a grasp of the future, but a powerless grasp: prophetic
isolation which, before time, ever announces the beginning.

8
To present this question in a context closer to historical actuality, one might say: the more the
world is affirmed as the future and the broad daylight of truth, where everything will have
value, bear meaning, where the whole will be achieved under the mastery of man and for his
use, the more it seems that art must descend toward that point where nothing has meaning yet,
the more it matters that art maintain the movement, the insecurity and the grief of that which
escapes every grasp and all ends. The artist and the poet seem to have received this mission:
to call us obstinately back to error, to turn us toward that space where everything we propose,
everything we have acquired, everything we are, all that opens upon the earth and in the sky,
returns to insignificance, and where what approaches is the nonserious and the nontrue, as if
perhaps thence sprang the source of all authenticity.



Appendixes



The Essential Solitude and Solitude in the World
When I am alone, it is not I who am there, and it is not from you that I stay away, or from others,
or from the world. I am not the subject to whom this impression of solitude would come -- this
awareness of my limits; it is not that I tire of being myself. When I am alone, I am not there. This
is not a sign of some psychological state, indicating loss of consciousness, the disappearance of
my right to feel what I feel from a center which I myself would be. What approaches me is not
my being a little less myself, but rather something which there is "behind me," and which this
"me" conceals in order to come into its own.
When I am on the worldly plane, which I share with things and beings, being is profoundly
hidden. (It is the thought of this concealment that Heidegger urges us to welcome.) This
dissimulation can become real action, negation. "I am" (in the world) tends to signify that I am
only if I can separate myself from being. We negate being -- or, to elucidate this by means of a
particular example, we negate, we transform nature. In this negation which is action and which is
time, beings are brought to fruition, and men stand forth erect in the liberty of the "I am." What
makes me me is this decision to be by being separate from being -- to be without being, to be that
which owes nothing to being, whose power comes from the refusal to be. I decide to be
absolutely "denatured," the absolutely separated: that is, the absolutely absolute.
However, the power with which I affirm myself by denying being, is real only in the allencompassing
community of men, the shared movement of projects actively undertaken and of
time's progress. "I am" -- the decision, that is, to be without being -- has true meaning only
because it is my decision based upon the whole of humanity, or because, in other words, this
decision is taken within the movement

which it makes possible and which makes it real. This reality is always historical. It is the world
which is always the process of the world's own realization.
Yet it happens that this decision which causes me to be outside of being (which illuminates the
refusal to be by concentrating it in that unique flash of lightning, the point at which "I am") -- it
happens that this masterful possibility to be free from being, separated from being, also becomes
the separation of beings: the absoluteness of an "I am" that wants to affirm itself without
reference to others. This is what is generally called solitude (as the world understands this term).
It can be experienced as the pride of solitary mastery, the cultivation of differences, subjectivity
breaking the dialectical tension through which it is realized. Or solitude may disclose the
nothingness that founds the "I am." Then the solitary "I" sees that it is separated, but is no longer
able to recognize in this separation the source of its power. It can no longer make of separation 
the means of action and productive undertakings, the expression and the truth which found all
exterior communication.
No doubt this latter experience is the cause generally attributed to the anguish of the great
upheaval. Man becomes aware of himself as separated, absent from being; he becomes conscious
of the fact that he owes his essence to his not being. But however critical this may be, it still
hides the essential. That I am nothing certainly implies that "I hold myself back within
nothingness," and this is black and agonizing, but it also implies this marvel: that nothingness is
my power, that I can not be. Hence man's liberty, his mastery, and his future.
I am he who is not, he who has seceded -- the separated one, or as it is said, the one in whom
being is brought into question. Men affirm themselves by means of the power not to be: thus do
they act, speak, comprehend always other than they are, escaping being by defying it -- by way
of a risk, a struggle which continues even unto death, and which is history. This is what Hegel
has shown. "The life of the mind begins with death." When death becomes power, then man
begins, and this beginning rules that, in order for there to be a world, in order for there to be
beings, being must lack.
What does this signify?
When being lacks, when nothingness becomes power, man is fully historical. But when being
lacks, is there a lack of being? When being lacks, does this mean that this lack owes nothing to
being? Or rather does it mean perhaps that the lack is the being that lies deep in the absence of
being -- that the lack is what still remains of being when

there is nothing? When being lacks, it is still only profoundly concealed. He who approaches this
lack -- this lack which is present in the "essential solitude" -- is approached by the being which
the absence of being makes present. This is no longer concealed being, but the being of this
concealment: dissimulation itself.
Here it certainly seems we have taken one more step toward what we seek. In the tranquility of
ordinary life, dissimulation is hidden. In action, true action -- the action which is history's
laborious unfolding -- concealment tends to become negation (the negative is our task, and this
task is the task of truth). But in what we call the essential solitude, concealment tends to appear.
When beings lack, being appears as the depth of the concealment in which it becomes lack.
When concealment appears, concealment, having become appearance, makes "everything
disappear," but of this "everything has disappeared" it makes another appearance. It makes
appearance from then on stem from "everything has disappeared." "Everything has disappeared"
appears. This is exactly what we call an apparition. It is the "everything has disappeared"
appearing in its turn. And the apparition says precisely that when everything has disappeared,
there still is something: when everything lacks, lack makes the essence of being appear, and the
essence of being is to be there still where it lacks, to be inasmuch as it is hidden . . .

The Two Versions of the Imaginary 
But what is the image? When there is nothing, the image finds in this nothing its necessary
condition, but there it disappears. The image needs the neutrality and the fading of the world; it
wants everything to return to the indifferent deep where nothing is affirmed; it tends toward the
intimacy of what still subsists in the void. This is its truth. But this truth exceeds it. What makes
it possible is the limit where it ceases. Hence its critical aspect, the dramatic ambiguity it
introduces and the brilliant lie for which it is reproached. It is surely a splendid power, Pascal
says, which makes of eternity a nothing and of nothingness an eternity.
The image speaks to us, and seems to speak intimately to us of ourselves. But the term
"intimately" does not suffice. Let us say rather that the image intimately designates the level
where personal intimacy is destroyed and that it indicates in this movement the menacing
proximity of a vague and empty outside, the deep, the sordid basis upon which it continues to
affirm things in their disappearance. Thus it speaks to us, à propos of each thing, of less than this
thing, but of us. And, speaking of us, it speaks to us of less than us, of that less than nothing that
subsists when there is nothing.
The gratifying aspect of the image is that it constitutes a limit at the edge of the indefinite. This
fine line does not hold us at a distance from things so much as it preserves us from the blind
pressure of this distance. Thanks to the image, the remove is at our command. Because of the
inflexibility of the reflection, we think ourselves masters of absence which has become interval,
and the dense void itself seems to open onto the radiance of another day.

In this way the image fulfills one of its functions which is to quiet, to humanize the formless
nothingness pressed upon us by the indelible residue of being. The image cleanses this residue --
appropriates it, makes it pleasing and pure, and allows us to believe, dreaming the happy dream
which art too often authorizes, that, separated from the real and immediately behind it, we find,
as pure pleasure and superb satisfaction, the transparent eternity of the unreal.
"For in that sleep of death what dreams may come," says Hamlet, "when we have shuffled off
this mortal coil . . ." The image, present behind each thing, and which is like the dissolution of
this thing and its subsistence in its dissolution, also has behind it that heavy sleep of death in
which dreams threaten. The image can, when it awakens or when we waken it, represent the
object to us in a luminous formal aura; but it is nonetheless with substance that the image is
allied -- with the fundamental materiality, the still undetermined absence of form, the world
oscillating between adjective and substantive before foundering in the formless prolixity of
indetermination. Hence the passivity proper to the image -- a passivity which makes us suffer the
image even when we ourselves appeal to it, and makes its fugitive transparency stem from the
obscurity of fate returned to its essence, which is to be a shade.
But when we are face to face with things themselves -- if we fix upon a face, the corner of a wall
-- does it not also sometimes happen that we abandon ourselves to what we see? Bereft of power
before this presence suddenly strangely mute and passive, are we not at its mercy? Indeed, this
can happen, but it happens because the thing we stare at has foundered, sunk into its image, and
the image has returned into that deep fund of impotence to which everything reverts. The "real"
is defined by our relation to it which is always alive. The real always leaves us the initiative, 
addressing in us that power to begin, that free communication with the beginning which we are.
And as long as we are in the day, day is still just dawning.
The image, according to the ordinary analysis, is secondary to the object. It is what follows. We
see, then we imagine. After the object comes the image. "After" means that the thing must first
take itself off a ways in order to be grasped. But this remove is not the simple displacement of a
moveable object which would nevertheless remain the same. Here the distance is in the heart of
the thing. The thing was there; we grasped it in the vital movement of a comprehensive action --
and lo, having become image, instantly it has become that which no one can grasp, the unreal,
the impossible. It is not the same thing at a distance

but the thing as distance, present in its absence, graspable because ungraspable, appearing as
disappeared. It is the return of what does not come back, the strange heart of remoteness as the
life and the sole heart of the thing.
In the image, the object again grazes something which it had dominated in order to be an object -
- something counter to which it had defined and built itself up. Now that its value, its meaning is
suspended, now that the world abandons it to idleness and lays it aside, the truth in it ebbs, and
materiality, the elemental, reclaims it. This impoverishment, or enrichment, consecrates it as
image.
However: does the reflection not always appear more refined than the object reflected? Isn't the
image the ideal expression of the object, its presence liberated from existence? Isn't the image
form without matter? And isn't the task of artists, who are exiled in the illusory realm of images,
to idealize beings -- to elevate them to their disembodied resemblance?
The Image, the Remains
The image does not, at first glance, resemble the corpse, but the cadaver's strangeness is perhaps
also that of the image. What we call mortal remains escapes common categories. Something is
there before us which is not really the living person, nor is it any reality at all. It is neither the
same as the person who was alive, nor is it another person, nor is it anything else. What is there,
with the absolute calm of something that has found its place, does not, however, succeed in being
convincingly here. Death suspends the relation to place, even though the deceased rests heavily
in his spot as if upon the only basis that is left him. To be precise, this basis lacks, the place is
missing, the corpse is not in its place. Where is it? It is not here, and yet it is not anywhere else.
Nowhere? But then nowhere is here. The cadaverous presence establishes a relation between
here and nowhere. The quiet that must be preserved in the room where someone dies and around
the deathbed gives a first indication of how fragile the position par excellence is. The corpse is
here, but here in its turn becomes a corpse: it becomes "here below" in absolute terms, for there
is not yet any "above" to be exalted. The place where someone dies is not some indifferent spot.
It seems inappropriate to transport the body from one place to another. The deceased cleaves
jealously to his place, joining it profoundly, in such a way that the indifference of this place, the
fact that it is after all just a place among others, becomes the profundity of his presence as
deceased --

becomes the basis of indifference, the gaping intimacy of an undifferentiable nowhere which
must nevertheless be located here.
He who dies cannot tarry. The deceased, it is said, is no longer of this world; he has left it
behind. But behind there is, precisely, this cadaver, which is not of the world either, even though
it is here. Rather, it is behind the world. It is that which the living person (and not the deceased)
left behind him and which now affirms, from here, the possibility of a world behind the world, of
a regression, an indefinite subsistance, undetermined and indifferent, about which we only know
that human reality, upon finishing, reconstitutes its presence and its proximity. This is an
impression which could be said to be common. He who just died is at first extremely close to the
condition of a thing -- a familiar thing, which we approach and handle, which does not hold us at
a distance and whose manageable passivity betrays only sad impotence. Certainly dying is an
incomparable event, and he who dies "in your arms" is in a sense your brother forever. But now,
he is dead. And as we know, certain tasks must be performed quickly, not so much because
death's rigor will soon make these actions more difficult, but because human action will shortly
be "displaced." Presently, there will be -- immoveable, untouchable, riveted to here by the
strangest embrace and yet drifting with it, drawing here under, bearing it lower -- from behind
there will be no longer an inanimate thing, but Someone: the unbearable image and figure of the
unique becoming nothing in particular, no matter what.
The Cadaverous Resemblance
When this moment has come, the corpse appears in the strangeness of its solitude as that which
has disdainfully withdrawn from us. Then the feeling of a relation between humans is destroyed,
and our mourning, the care we take of the dead and all the prerogatives of our former passions,
since they can no longer know their direction, fall back upon us, return toward us. It is striking
that at this very moment, when the cadaverous presence is the presence of the unknown before
us, the mourned deceased begins to resemble himself.
Himself: is this not an ill-chosen expression? Shouldn't we say: the deceased resembles the
person he was when he was alive? "Resembles himself" is, however, correct. "Himself"
designates the impersonal being, distant and inaccessible, which resemblance, that it might be
someone's, draws toward the day. Yes, it is he, the dear living person, but

all the same it is more than he. He is more beautiful, more imposing; he is already monumental
and so absolutely himself that it is as if he were doubled by himself, joined to his solemn
impersonality by resemblance and by the image. This magnified being, imposing and proud,
which impresses the living as the appearance of the original never perceived until now -- this
sentence of the last judgment inscribed deep within being and triumphantly expressing itself with
the aid of the remote -- this grandeur, through its appearance of supreme authority, may well
bring to mind the great images of classical art. If this connection is justified, the question of
classical art's idealism will seem rather vain. And we might bear in mind the thought that
idealism has, finally, no guarantee other than a corpse. For this indicates to what extent the
apparent intellectual refinement, the pure virginity of the image is originally linked to the
elemental strangeness and to the formless weight of being, present in absence. 
Let us look again at this splendid being from which beauty streams: he is, I see this, perfectly
like himself: he resembles himself. The cadaver is its own image. It no longer entertains any
relation with this world, where it still appears, except that of an image, an obscure possibility, a
shadow ever present behind the living form which now, far from separating itself from this form,
transforms it entirely into shadow. The corpse is a reflection becoming master of the life it
reflects -- absorbing it, identifying substantively with it by moving it from its use value and from
its truth value to something incredible -- something neutral which there is no getting used to.
And if the cadaver is so similar, it is because it is, at a certain moment, similarity par excellence:
altogether similarity, and also nothing more. It is the likeness, like to an absolute degree,
overwhelming and marvelous. But what is it like? Nothing.
That is why no man alive, in fact, bears any resemblance yet. In the rare instances when a living
person shows similitude with himself, he only seems to us more remote, closer to a dangerous
neutral region, astray in himself and like his own ghost already: he seems to return no longer
having any but an echo life.
By analogy, we might also recall that a tool, when damaged, becomes its image (and sometimes
an esthetic object like "those outmoded objects, fragmented, unusable, almost incomprehensible,
perverse," which André Breton loved). In this case the tool, no longer disappearing into its use,
appears. This appearance of the object is that of resemblance and reflection: the object's double,
if you will. The

category of art is linked to this possibility for objects to "appear," to surrender, that is, to the pure
and simple resemblance behind which there is nothing -- but being. Only that which is
abandoned to the image appears, and everything that appears is, in this sense, imaginary.
The cadaverous resemblance haunts us. But its haunting presence is not the unreal visitation of
the ideal. What haunts us is something inaccessible from which we cannot extricate ourselves. It
is that which cannot be found and therefore cannot be avoided. What no one can grasp is the
inescapable. The fixed image knows no repose, and this is above all because it poses nothing,
establishes nothing. Its fixity, like that of the corpse, is the position of what stays with us because
it has no place. (The idée fixe is not a point of departure, a position from which one could start
off and progress, it is not a beginning, it begins again.) We dress the corpse, and we bring it as
close as possible to a normal appearance by effacing the hurtful marks of sickness, but we know
that in its ever so peaceful and secure immobility it does not rest. The place which it occupies is
drawn down by it, sinks with it, and in this dissolution attacks the possibility of a dwelling place
even for us who remain. We know that at "a certain moment" the power of death makes it keep
no longer to the handsome spot assigned it. No matter how calmly the corpse has been laid out
upon its bed for final viewing, it is also everywhere in the room, all over the house. At every
instant it can be elsewhere than where it is. It is where we are apart from it, where there is
nothing; it is an invading presence, an obscure and vain abundance. The belief that at a certain
moment the deceased begins to wander, to stray from his place, must be understood as stemming
from the premonition of the error which now he represents.
Eventually we have to put a term to the interminable. We do not cohabit with the dead for fear of
seeing here collapse into the unfathomable nowhere -- a fall the House of Usher illustrated. And 
so the dear departed is conveyed into another place. No doubt this site is only symbolically set
apart; doubtless it is by no means really unsituatable. But it is nevertheless true that the here of
the here lies, filled in by names, well-formed phrases and affirmations of identity, is the
anonymous and impersonal place par excellence. And it is as though, within the limits which
have been traced for it and in the vain guise of a will capable of surviving everything, the
monotony of an infinite disintegration were at work to efface the living truth proper to every
place and make it equivalent to the absolute neutrality of death.

(Perhaps this slow disappearance, this unending erosion of the end, sheds some light upon the
remarkable passion of certain murderesses who kill with poison. Their joy is not to cause
suffering, or even to kill slowly or surreptitiously, but, by poisoning time, by transforming it into
an imperceptible consumption, to touch upon the indefinite which is death. Thus they graze the
horror, they live furtively underneath everything living in a pure decomposition which nothing
divulges, and the poison is the colorless substance of this eternity. Feuerbach recounts of one
such murderess that the poison was a friend for her, a companion to whom she felt passionately
drawn. When, after a poisoning that lasted several months, she was presented with a packet of
arsenic which belonged to her, so that she would recognize it, she trembled with joy -- she had a
moment of ecstasy.)
The Image and Signification
Man is made in his image: this is what the strangeness of the cadaver's resemblance teaches us.
But this formula must first be understood as follows: man is unmade according to his image. The
image has nothing to do with signification or meaningfulness as they are implied by the world's
existence, by effort that aims at truth, by law and the light of day. Not only is the image of an
object not the sense of this object, and not only is it of no avail in understanding the object, it
tends to withdraw the object from understanding by maintaining it in the immobility of a
resemblance which has nothing to resemble.
Granted, we can always recapture the image and make it serve the world's truth. But in that case
we reverse the relation which is proper to it. The image becomes the object's aftermath, that
which comes later, which is left over and allows us still to have the object at our command when
there is nothing left of it. This is a formidable resource, reason's fecund power. Practical life and
the accomplishment of true tasks require this reversal. So too does classical art, at least in theory,
for it stakes all its glory upon linking a figure to resemblance and the image to a body -- upon
reincorporating the image. The image, then, became life-giving negation, the ideal operation by
which man, capable of negating nature, raises it to a higher meaning, either in order to know it or
to enjoy it admiringly. Thus was art at once ideal and true, faithful to the figure and faithful to
the truth which admits of no figure. Impersonality, ultimately, authenticated works. But
impersonality was also the troubling intersection where the noble ideal concerned with values

on the one hand, and on the other, anonymous, blind, impersonal resemblance changed places,
each passing for the other, each one the other's dupe. "What vanity is painting which wins
admiration for its resemblance to things we do not admire in the original!" What could be more
striking than Pascal's strong distrust of resemblance, which he suspects delivers things to the 
sovereignty of the void and to the vainest persistence -- to an eternity which, as he says, is
nothingness, the nothingness which is eternal.
The Two Versions
Thus the image has two possibilities: there are two versions of the imaginary. And this duplicity
comes from the intial double meaning which the power of the negative brings with it and from
the fact that death is sometimes truth's elaboration in the world and sometimes the perpetuity of
that which admits neither beginning nor end.
It is very true then, that as contemporary philosophies would have it, comprehension and
knowing in man are linked to what we call finitude; but where is the finish? Granted, it is taken
in or understood as the possibility which is death. But it is also "taken back" by this possibility
inasmuch as in death the possibility which is death dies too. And it also seems -- even though all
of human history signifies the hope of overcoming this ambiguity -- that to resolve or transcend
it always involves the greatest dangers. It is as if the choice between death as understanding's
possibility and death as the horror of impossibility had also to be the choice between sterile truth
and the prolixity of the nontrue. It is as if comprehension were linked to penury and horror to
fecundity. Hence the fact that the ambiguity, although it alone makes choosing possible, always
remains present in the choice itself.
But how then is the ambiguity manifested? What happens, for example, when one lives an event
as an image?
To live an event as an image is not to remain uninvolved, to regard the event disinterestedly in
the way that the esthetic version of the image and the serene ideal of classical art propose. But
neither is it to take part freely and decisively. It is to be taken: to pass from the region of the real
where we hold ourselves at a distance from things the better to order and use them into that other
region where the distance holds us -- the distance which then is the lifeless deep, an
unmanageable, inappreciable remoteness which has become something like the sovereign power
behind all things. This movement implies infinite degrees. Thus

psychoanalysis maintains that the image, far from abstracting us and causing us to live in the
mode of gratuitous fantasy, seems to deliver us profoundly to ourselves. The image is intimate.
For it makes of our intimacy an exterior power which we suffer passively. Outside of us, in the
ebb of the world which it causes, there trails, like glistening debris, the utmost depth of our
passions.
Magic gets its power from this transformation. Its aim, through a methodical technique, is to
arouse things as reflections and to thicken consciousness into a thing. From the moment we are
outside ourselves -- in that ectasy which is the image -- the "real" enters an equivocal realm
where there is no longer any limit or interval, where there are no more successive moments, and
where each thing, absorbed in the void of its reflection, nears consciousness, while consciousness
allows itself to become filled with an anonymous plenitude. Thus the universal unity seems to be
reconstituted. Thus, behind things, the soul of each thing obeys charms which the ecstatic
magician, having abandoned himself to "the universe," now controls. The paradox of magic is
evident: it claims to be initiative and free domination, all the while accepting, in order to 
constitute itself, the reign of passivity, the realm where there are no ends. But its intention
remains instructive: what it wants is to act upon the world (to maneuver it) from the standpoint
of being that precedes the world -- from the eternal before, where action is impossible. That is
why it characteristically turns toward the cadaver's strangeness and why its only serious name is
black magic.
To live an event as an image is not to see an image of this event, nor is it to attribute to the event
the gratuitous character of the imaginary. The event really takes place -- and yet does it "really"
take place? The occurrence commands us, as we would command the image. That is, it releases
us, from it and from ourselves. It keeps us outside; it makes of this outside a presence where "I"
does not recognize "itself." This movement implies infinite degrees. We have spoken of two
versions of the imaginary: the image can certainly help us to grasp the thing ideally, and in this
perspective it is the life-giving negation of the thing; but at the level to which its particular
weight drags us, it also threatens constantly to relegate us, not to the absent thing, but to its
absence as presence, to the neutral double of the object in which all belonging to the world is
dissipated. This duplicity, we must stress, is not such as to be mastered by the discernment of an
either-or in it that could authorize a choice and lift from the choice the ambiguity that makes

choosing possible. The duplicity itself refers us back to a still more primal double meaning.
The Levels of Ambiguity
If for a moment thought could maintain ambiguity, it would be tempted to state that there are
three levels at which ambiguity is perceptible. On the worldly plane it is the possibility of give
and take: meaning always escapes into another meaning; thus misunderstandings serve
comprehension by expressing the truth of intelligibility which rules that we never come to an
understanding once and for all.
Another level is expressed by the two versions of the imaginary. Here it is no longer a question
of perpetual double meanings -- of misunderstandings aiding or impeding agreement. Here what
speaks in the name of the image "sometimes" still speaks of the world, and "sometimes"
introduces us into the undetermined milieu of fascination. "Sometimes" it gives us the power to
control things in their absence and through fiction, thus maintaining us in a domain rich with
meaning; but "sometimes" it removes us to where things are perhaps present, but in their image,
and where the image is passivity, where it has no value either significative or affective, but is the
passion of indifference. However, what we distinguish by saying "sometimes, sometimes,"
ambiguity introduces by "always," at least to a certain extent, saying both one and the other. It
still proposes the significant image from the center of fascination, but it already fascinates us
with the clarity of the purest, the most formal image. Here meaning does not escape into another
meaning, but into the other of all meaning. Because of ambiguity nothing has meaning, but
everything seems infinitely meaningful. Meaning is no longer anything but semblance;
semblance makes meaning become infinitely rich. It makes this infinitude of meaning have no
need of development -- it makes meaning immediate, which is also to say incapable of being
developed, only immediately void. 1

1Can we go further? Ambiguity defines being in terms of its dissimulation; it says that being is, 
inasmuch as it is concealed. In order for being to accomplish its work, it has to be hidden: it
proceeds by hiding itself, it is always reserved and preserved by dissimulation, but also
removed from it. Dissimulation tends, then, to become the purity of negation. But at the same
time, when everything is hidden, ambiguity announces (and this announcement is ambiguity
itself) that the whole of being is via dissimulation; that being is essentially its being at the
heart of concealment.

Sleep, Night
What happens at night? Generally we sleep. By means of sleep, day uses night to blot out the
night. Sleep belongs to the world; it is a task. We sleep in accord with the general law which
makes our daytime activity depend on our nightly repose. We call upon sleep and it comes.
There is between sleep and us something like a pact, a treaty with no secret clauses, and
according to this convention it is agreed that, far from being a dangerous, bewitching force, sleep
will become domesticated and serve as the instrument of our power to act. We surrender to sleep,
but in the way that the master entrusts himself to the slave who serves him. Sleeping is the clear
action which promises us to the day. To sleep: admire this remarkable act of vigilance. Only
deep sleep lets us escape what there is in the deep of sleep. Where is night? There is no longer
any night.
Sleeping is an event which belongs to history, just as rest on the seventh day belongs to creation.
Night, when men transform it into pure sleep, is not a nocturnal affirmation. I sleep. The
sovereignty of the "I" dominates this absence which it grants itself and which is its doing. I sleep:
it is I who sleep and none other -- and men of action, the great men of history, are proud of their
perfect sleep from which they

So ambiguity does not consist only in the incessant movement by which being returns to
nothingness and nothingness refers back to being. Ambiguity is no longer the primordial Yes
and No in which being and nothingness would be pure identity. The essential ambiguity
would lie, rather, in this: that before the beginning, nothingness is not on equal standing with
being, but is only the appearance of being's concealment, or again, that dissimulation is more
"original" than negation. So, one could say: ambiguity is all the more essential because
dissimulation cannot quite be captured in negation.

arise intact. This is why the sleep which in the normal pursuits of our life sometimes takes us by
surprise is by no means a scandal. Our capacity to withdraw from everyday bustle, from daily
concerns, from everything, from ourselves and even from the void is the sign of our mastery, an
entirely human proof of our sangfroid. You must sleep: this is the watchword which
consciousness assigns itself, and this commandment to renounce the day is one of day's first
rules.
Sleep transforms night into possibility. Vigilance is sleep when night falls. Whoever does not
sleep cannot stay awake. Vigilance consists in not always keeping watch, for it seeks awakening
as its essence. Nocturnal wandering, the tendency to stray when the world is attenuated and
grows distant, and even the honest professions which are necessarily practiced at night attract 
suspicions. To sleep with open eyes is an anomaly symbolically indicating something which the
general consciousness does not approve of. People who sleep badly always appear more or less
guilty. What do they do? They make night present.
Bergson said that sleep is disinterestedness. Perhaps sleep is inattention to the world, but this
negation of the world conserves us for the world and affirms the world. Sleep is an act of fidelity
and of union. I entrust myself to the great natural rhythms, to the laws, to the stability of order.
My sleep is the realization of this trust, the affirmation of this faith. It is an attachment, in the
affective sense of this term: I attach myself, not like Ulysses to the mast with bonds from which
later I would like to free myself, but through an agreement expressed by the sensual accord of
my head with the pillow, of my body with the peace and happiness of the bed. I retire from the
world's immensity and its disquietude, but in order to give myself to the world, which is
maintained, thanks to my "attachment," in the sure truth of a limited and firmly circumscribed
place. Sleep is my absolute interest in assuring myself of the world. From this limit which sleep
provides, I take hold of the world by its finite side; I grasp it firmly enough so that it stays, puts
me in place, puts me to rest. To sleep badly is precisely to be unable to find one's position. The
bad sleeper tosses and turns in search of that genuine place which he knows is unique. He knows
that only in that spot will the world give up its errant immensity. The sleepwalker is suspect, for
he is the man who does not find repose in sleep. Asleep, he is nevertheless without a place and, it
may be said, without faith. He lacks fundamental sincerity, or, more precisely, his sincerity lacks
a foundation. It lacks that position he seeks, which is also repose, where he would affirm himself
in the stable fixity of his absence, which would be his support.

Bergson saw behind sleep the totality of conscious life minus the effort of concentration. On the
contrary, sleep is intimacy with the center. I am, not dispersed, but entirely gathered together
where I am, in this spot which is my position and where the world, because of the firmness of my
attachment, localizes itself. Where I sleep, I fix myself and I fix the world. My person is there,
prevented from erring, no longer unstable, scattered and distracted, but concentrated in the
narrowness of this place where the world recollects itself, which I affirm and which affirms me.
Here the place is present in me and I absent in it through an essentially ecstatic union. My person
is not simply situated where I sleep; it is this very site, and my sleeping is the fact that now my
abode is my being. 1
It is true that in sleep I seem to close in upon myself, in an attitude which recalls the ignorant
bliss of early childhood. This may be; and yet it is not to myself alone that I entrust myself. I do
not find support in myself, but in the world which has become in me the narrowness and the limit
of my repose. Sleep is not normally a moment of weakness; it is not that I despondently abandon
my resolute point of view. Sleep signifies that at a certain moment, in order to act it is necessary
to cease acting -- that at a certain moment, lest I lose my way in aimless roving, I must stop and
manfully transform the instability of myriad possibilities into a single stopping point upon which
I establish and reestablish myself.
Vigilant existence does not dissipate in the sleeping body near which things remain; it withdraws
from the remove which is its temptation. It returns from there to the primordial affirmation which
is the authority of the body when the body is not separated but fully in agreement with the truth
of place. To be surprised at finding everything still there in the morning is to forget that nothing 
is surer than sleep and that the meaning of sleep lies precisely in its being vigilant existence
concentrating upon certitude, linking up all errant possibilities to the fixity of a principle and
satiating itself with this certitude, so that the morning's newness can welcome it and a new day
can begin.
The Dream
Night, the essence of night, does not let us sleep. In the night no refuge is to be found in sleep.
And if you fail sleep, exhaustion finally sickens you, and this sickness prevents sleeping; it is
expressed by insomnia,

1
This is strongly expressed by Emmanuel Levinas ( From Existence to Existences).

by the impossibility of making sleep a free zone, a clear and true resolution. In the night one
cannot sleep.
One does not proceed from day to night. Whoever follows this route finds only sleep -- sleep
which ends the day but in order to make the next day possible; sleep which is the downward
bending that verifies the rising curve; sleep which is, granted, a lack, a silence, but one imbued
with intentions and through which duties, goals, and real action speak for us. In this sense the
dream is closer than sleep to the nocturnal region. If day survives itself in the night, if it exceeds
its term, if it becomes that which cannot be interrupted, then already it is no longer the day. It is
the uninterrupted and the incessant. Notwithstanding events that seem to belong to time, and
even though it is peopled with beings that seem to be those of the world, this interminable "day"
is the approach of time's absence, the threat of the outside where the world lacks.
The dream is the reawakening of the interminable. It is an allusion at least, and something like a
dangerous call -- through the persistence of what cannot finish -- to the neutrality that presses up
behind the beginning. Hence the fact that the dream seems to bring up in each of us the being of
earliest times -- and not only the child, but still further back, the most remote, the mythic, the
emptiness and vagueness of the anterior. He who dreams sleeps, but already he who dreams is he
who sleeps no longer. He is not another, some other person, but the premonition of the other, of
that which cannot say "I" any more, which recognizes itself neither in itself nor in others.
Doubtless the force of vigilant existence and the fidelity of sleep, and still more the interpretation
that gives meaning to a semblance of meaning, safeguard the outlines and forms of a personal
reality: that which becomes other is reincarnated in another, the double is still somebody. The
dreamer believes he knows that he is dreaming and that he is asleep, precisely at the moment
when the schism between the two is effected. He dreams that he is dreaming. And this flight
from the dream which plunges him back into the dream, into the dream which is an eternal fall
into the same dream -- this repetition whereby personal truth wanting to rescue itself loses itself
more and more, and which is like the return of the same dreams or the unspeakable harassment
of a reality which always escapes and which one cannot escape -- all this is like a dream of the
night, a dream where the form of the dream becomes its sole content. Perhaps one could say that
the dream is all the more nocturnal in that it turns around itself, that it dreams itself, that it has
for its content its possibility.

Perhaps there is no dream except of the dream. Valéry doubted the existence of dreams. The
dream is like the reason for this doubt, and indeed its indubitable confirmation. The dream is that
which cannot "really" be.
The dream touches the region where pure resemblance reigns. Everything there is similar; each
figure is another one, is similar to another and to yet another, and this last to still another. One
seeks the original model, wanting to be referred to a point of departure, an initial revelation, but
there is none. The dream is the likeness that refers eternally to likeness.

Hölderlin's Itinerary
The young Hölderlin, the author of Hyperion, yearns to take leave of his form, escape his limits,
and be united with nature. "To be one with all that lives, and to return in blessed selfforgetfulness
into the All of Nature -- that is man's heaven." This aspiration to return into life's
unity, into its eternal ardor, unreserved and immeasurable, seems to be the joyful movement
which we are tempted to associate with inspiration. This movement is also desire for death.
Diotima dies through the very impluse that makes her live in familiarity with all. But, she says,
"we will part only to live more closely united, in a holier peace with all things, with ourselves."
Empedocles, in the tragedy which is the work of Hölderlin's first maturity, represents the will to
burst into the world of the Invisible Ones by dying. The motifs of this unfinished work vary
according to its different versions, but the wish remains the same: to be united with the fiery
element, the sign and presence of inspiration, in order to attain the intimacy of the divine
relation.
The great hymns no longer have the undisciplined or violent character of Empedocles. But the
poet is still essentially the mediator. In So on a festival day (one of the best known of Hölderlin's
hymns in France, through the various translations that have been made of it and Heidegger's
commentaries), the poet stands before the god. He is as if in contact with the highest power, and
thus he is exposed to the greatest danger -- danger of being burned by the fire, of being destroyed
by the upheaval. It is his task to tame this danger by silently, intimately welcoming it into
himself so that in him glad words might be born which the sons of the earth can hear without
peril. This task of mediation, to which we often attach Hölderlin's name, is perhaps never
expressed

so boldly by him as in this single passage.1
 The hymn probably dates from 1800, but the lines of
this stanza may go back to an earlier period. In the same hymn, nature is again celebrated as the
intimacy of the divine. Yet here nature is no longer the force to which one must surrender in an
unrestrained movement of abandon. It "educates" the poet, but through his sleep, and in the calm
time when the commotion is suspended, in the quiet that follows the storm (the fire). The hour
that follows the storm: this is the favorable hour, the hour of grace and of inspiration.
"The Categorical Reversal"
And yet Hölderlin's experience, his meditation upon ancient Greece and his no less intense
meditation upon European civilization, led him to conceive of an alternation in the life of peoples 
as well as in individual lives, between times when the gods are present and times when they are
absent -- periods of light, periods of darkness. At the end of the poem entitled The Poet's
Vocation, he wrote initially:
But when it is necessary man remains without fear
Before God, simplicity protects him,
And he needs neither arms nor guile
As long as the God does not fail him.
But later, instead of the last line, he wrote, "Until God's default helps him." This is a strange
revision. What does it mean?
After Hölderlin came back from his trip in the south of France -which ended with his first
evident mental crisis -- he lived several more years in semiretirement, writing his last hymns or
fragments of hymns, the translations of Antigone and of Oedipus, and finally the theoretical
considerations which comprise prefaces to these translations. It is in one of these texts that he
formulates what he calls die vaterländische Umkehr, the native reversal: not simply a return
toward the place of birth, toward the fatherland, but a movement accomplished according to what
this place requires. What is this requirement? Hölderlin had answered this question a short time
before his departure in a famous letter to his friend Boehlendorf in which he discreetly criticizes
one of Boehlendorf s works, infused with too much enthusiasm. Hölderlin writes, "The clarity of
representation is as naturally original to us as the

3And also in the poem, Poet's Vocation, cited below.

fire of the sky was to the Greeks." "Us" designates first the Germans, then the Hesperians,
Western men. "The clarity of representation," which in the same letter he calls "lucidity or order,
Junonian, Occidental measure," is the power to grasp and to define, the force of a firm ordering
principle, in sum the will to distinguish well and to stay upon the earth. "The fire of the sky" is
the sign of the gods, the storm, Empedocles' element. But Hölderlin adds right away that the
instinct which forms and educates men has this effect: they only learn, they only really possess
what is foreign to them. What is close to them is not near them. That is why the Greeks, strangers
to clarity, acquired to an exceptional degree the power of sober moderation; Homer remains its
finest example. That is why the Hesperians, and in particular the Germans, have become masters
of the sacred pathos which was foreign to them. But now what they must learn is what is proper
to them, and this is the most difficult: to learn measure, lucidity, and also how to subsist
steadfastly in this world.
The kind of law Hölderlin formulates here still seems only as significant as a well defined
precept advising the poets of his country -- advising Hölderlin himself -- not to give in
unrestrainedly to the Empedoclean will, to the dizziness and the dazzling brilliance of the fire. At
this point Hölderlin feels only too tempted by the sign of the gods and dangerously close to the
foreign. In the same letter he says, "I will have to take care not to lose my head in France" (
France represented for him the approach to the fire, the opening onto ancient Greece). Likewise
he will say, when he has suffered the decisive blow, "We have almost lost our speech in a
foreign land." 
He goes, then, to a "foreign land," he submits to the decisive blow, he suffers it in some manner
constantly, he lives under its threat, in its proximity. It is at this point that he elaborates in much
grander terms upon the sort of reversal of which he had spoken to his friend. 2
 Today, he says,
we dwell under the law of a more authentic Zeus. This more authentic god "bends the course of
nature -- that course eternally hostile to man because it is directed toward the other world -- back
toward the earth." This formula is striking in itself and shows how far Hölderlin has moved away
from Empedocles. Empedocles is the desire to go into the other world, and it is this desire which
is now called inauthentic. It must be bent back toward the earth. And nature, so beloved,

4We refer here to Beda Allemann study, Hölderlin und Heidegger, which seeks to elucidate
the itinerary of the late Hölderlin.

so much sung, the educator par excellence, becomes "the eternal enemy of man" because it pulls
him beyond this world.
Today's man must, then, turn back. He must turn away from the realm of the gods which is also
the world of the dead -- turn away from the call of the last god, Christ, who has disappeared and
calls upon us to disappear. But how is this reversal possible? Is it an entirely human revolt? Is
man urged to stand up against the superior forces which are hostile to him because they would
turn him away from his terrestrial task? No, and it is here that Hölderlin's thought, though
already veiled by madness, appears more reflective, less facile than that of humanism. If Western
men are to bring about this decisive turning point, they must do so in the wake of the gods who
themselves accomplish what Hölderlin calls "the categorical reversal." The gods today turn
away; they are absent, unfaithful. And man must understand the sacred sense of this divine
infidelity, not by opposing it, but by performing it himself. "In such a moment," Hölderlin says,
"man forgets himself and forgets God; he turns back like a traitor, although in a holy manner."
This reversal is a terrible act, it is treachery, but it is not impious. For through this infidelity
whereby the separation of the worlds is affirmed, the purity of the gods' memory is also affirmed,
in the separation, the firmly maintained distinction. Indeed, Hölderlin adds: "In order that the
course of the world have no lacuna and that the memory of the Heavenly Ones not be lost, man
and the god enter into communication in the form of infidelity where there is forgetting of
everything. For infidelity is what can be contained the best."
These words are not easy to understand, but they become a little clearer if we bear in mind that
they were written as commentary on the Oedipus tragedy. Oedipus is the tragedy of the god's
departure. Oedipus is the hero who is constrained to live apart from the gods and from men. He
must endure this double separation; he must keep this split pure, must fill it with no vain
consolations. He must maintain there something like an in-between, an empty place opened by
the double aversion, the double infidelity of gods and men. He must keep it pure and empty, in
order that the distinction between the spheres be assured -- the distinction which from now on is
our task according to the rule expressed by Hölderlin when he is very close to the night:
"Preserve God by the purity of what distinguishes."

The Poet and Double Infidelity 
One might comment upon this idea of "reversal" from the point of view of Hölderlin and his
personal destiny. It is a mysterious and moving idea. It is as if the desire formed at the time of
Hyperion and of Empedocles-- the desire to be united with nature and with the gods -had become
an experience which entirely engages him and whose threatening excess he feels. What was
formerly only a wish of the soul which he could safely express immoderately has been
transformed into a real movement that exceeds him and makes him speak of an excess of favors
under which he succumbs. And this excess is too intense a pressure, too strong a pull toward a
world which is, not our world, but the world of divine immediacy. In the last hymns, in the
fragments of hymns which have been discovered and which belong to this period ( 1801-1805)
when the rupture has not yet occurred, the effort to master this irresistible call is ceaselessly felt -
- the effort to stay, to found stability and to remain on the earth. "Andas upon shoulders a burden
of logs, there is much to contain. . . ." "Andalways toward the unlimited goes desire. But there is
much to contain."
The more Hölderlin's experience of "the fire of the sky" intensifies, the more he expresses the
necessity not to surrender to it immoderately. This is in itself remarkable. But not only does he
denounce the experience as dangerous; he denounces it as false, insofar at least as it claims to be
immediate communication with the immediate. "The immediate," he says,
is in a strict sense impossible for mortals and for the immortals. The god must distinguish the
different worlds, in conformity with his nature, for the celestial goodness, in consideration for
itself, must remain sacred, unalloyed. Man too, as the power of knowing, must distinguish the
different worlds, because the opposition of contraries alone allows knowledge.
There is an energetic lucidity in this statement, an energetic affirmation of the limits of the
experience to which everything must have been pressing him to surrender without restraint. This
experience must not turn us toward the immediate, for not only is there the risk of perishing in
the fire's blaze, but the experience cannot so turn us. The immediate is impossible.

As for inspiration, there results from the "reversal" a richer conception of it, one more foreign to
simple desire. Inspiration no longer consists in receiving the sacred ray and softening it so that it
not burn men. And the poet's task is no longer restricted to the overly simple mediation which
required of him that he stand before God. It is before the absence of God that he must stand. He
must become the guardian of this absence, losing neither it nor himself in it. What he must
contain and preserve is the divine infidelity. For it is "in the form of infidelity where there is
forgetting of everything" that he enters into communication with the god who turns away.
This is a task closer to the goals of man as these are known to us today. But it is more tragic than
the task which promised to Empedocles and guaranteed to the Greeks union with the gods.
Today the poet no longer has to stand between gods and men as their intermediary. Rather, he
has to stand between the double infidelity; he must keep to the intersection of this double -- this
divine and human -- reversal. This double and reciprocal movement opens a hiatus, a void which
must henceforth constitute the essential relation of the two worlds. The poet, then, must resist the
pull of the gods (notably Christ) who disappear and draw him toward them in their
disappearance. He must resist pure and simple subsistence on the earth which poets do not found.
He must accomplish the double reversal, take upon himself the weight of the double infidelity 
and thus keep the two spheres distinct, by living the separation purely, by being the pure life of
the separation itself. For this empty and pure place which distinguishes between the spheres is
the sacred, the intimacy of the breach which is the sacred.
The Mystery of the God's Departure
This requirement, the native reversal -- "the extreme limit of suffering," as Hölderlin says -- has,
then, nothing in common with the sweet call of childhood familiarity, the desire to return to the
mother which hasty erudition and certain psychiatrists attribute to Hölderlin. Still less does it
signify a glorification of the earthly fatherland or of patriotic sentiment or a simple return to the
duties of this world, an apology for the happy medium, prosaic sobriety, and everyday naïveté.
The idea or vision of the categorical reversal, of that very demanding moment when time
somehow turns back, answers to what Jean-Paul had called -- and announces what later
Nietzsche, louder will call -- "The Death of God." Hölderlin lives this same event but with a
broader understanding, more foreign to the simplifications which even Nietzsche seems to
authorize. He helps us, at any rate, to reject these simplifications. And when today Georges
Bataille gives

to a part of his work the title Atheological Summa,
3
 he invites us not to read these words in the
tranquility of their manifest sense.
We are at a turning point. Hölderlin felt in himself the force of this reversal. The poet is he in
whom time turns back essentially and for whom in this time the god always turns and turns
away. But Hölderlin also conceives profoundly that this absence of the gods is not a purely
negative form of relation. That is why it is terrible. It is terrible not only because it deprives us of
the gods' benevolent presence, of the inspired word's familiarity -- not only because it casts us
back upon ourselves in the bare distress of an empty time -- but because it substitutes for the
measured favor of divine forms as represented by the Greeks (gods of light, gods of the initial
naïveté) a relation which threatens ceaselessly to tear and disorient us, with that which is higher
than the gods, with the sacred itself or with its perverted essence.
This is the mystery of the night of the gods' departure. By day, the gods have the form of day.
They enlighten, they care for man, they educate him and cultivate nature in the guise of slaves.
But in the nighttime the divine becomes the spirit of time turning back, carrying everything
away. "Then it cares not for men, it is the spirit of unexpressed and eternally living savagery, the
spirit of the realm of the dead." Hence the temptation of the inordinate, the measureless; hence
the desire that drags the poet immoderately toward that which has no attachments. But hence also
his greater duty to contain himself, to maintain the will to distinguish correctly in order to
preserve the distinction between the spheres and thus to safeguard, pure and empty, the place of
the breach which the eternal reversal of the gods and of men causes to appear and which is the
pure space of the sacred, the place that is all interval, the time of intervening time. In the very
late fragment Mnemosyne, Hölderlin says:
They cannot do everything,
The Heavenly Ones. Mortals touch
the abyss. Thus with them
Is the reversal accomplished. 
The abyss is reserved for mortals. But it is not only the empty abyss; it is the savage and
eternally living deep from which the gods are preserved. They preserve us from it, but they do
not reach it as we do. And so it is rather in the heart of man, symbol of crystalline purity, that the
truth of the reversal can be fulfilled. It is man's heart that must become the

place where light tests itself most severely, the intimacy where the echo of the empty deep
becomes speech. But this does not happen through one easy metamorphosis. As early as 1804, in
the hymn Germania, in lines that have a splendid rigor, Hölderlin had formulated the task of
poetic language, which belongs neither to the day nor to the night but always is spoken between
night and day and one single time speaks the truth and leaves it unspoken:
But if more abundantly than the pure sources
God shines and when in heaven the color darkens,
It is necessary that between day and night
A truth appear once.
In a triple metamorphosis transcribe it,
Yet always unexpressed, and it is,
Innocent, as it must remain.
When madness had completely obscured Hölderlin's mind, his poetry too reversed itself. All the
toughness, all the concentration there had been, and the almost unbearable tension in his last
hymns became repose, tranquility, and appeased power. Why? We do not know. Alleman
suggests that it is as if he had been broken by the effort of resisting the impulse which dragged
him away toward the boundlessness of the All -- as if he had been worn out by the effort of
withstanding the threat of nocturnal savagery -- but as if he had also vanquished this threat,
accomplished the reversal. It is as if, between day and night, the sky and the earth, there opened
henceforth, pure and naïve, a region where he could see things in their transparency: the sky in
its empty clarity and in this manifest void the face of God's remoteness. "Is God," he says, in one
of the poems of this period, "unknown? Is he open like the sky? I rather believe so." Or: "What is
God? Unknown, yet rich with particularities is the view which the sky offers of him." And when
we read these words gleaming with madness: "Would I like to be a comet? Yes. For they have
the speed of birds, they flourish in fire and are as children in purity," we sense how the desire to
be united with the fire and with the light of day may have been realized for the poet in the purity
which his exemplary rectitude assured him. And we are not surprised by this metamorphosis
which, with the silent speed of a bird's flight, bears him henceforth through the sky, a flower of
light, a star that burns but that unfurls innocently into a flower.

HOMECOMING OF LOVE AMONGST ILLUSTRIOUS RUINS
The calcined stones come back.
The fallen temples come back,
The bursted whore houses, the green courtyards
Where the smile of Priapus
Keeps warm the memory of fountains.
My love, let us go along the vanished streets,
Across the bright geometry which still points
To mysterious love and hidden
Pleasures, still so sweet in the night.
Here is the house of the goddess. In the blue
Sanctuary you can still smell the perfume
Of sea foam and jasmine and
Carnations salty with her flesh.
The phallic symbol, jolly as ever,
Riots in the thick foliage — stretched out
On the happy pan of the balance
Which offers it to love. It is heavier
Than all the fruits of the earth.
Aphrodite smiles in the shadows
As she feels the sea throb in her buttocks.


O ancient brightness! O far off light!
Naked light, love, shine on us always.
And when the day comes when we are no more than stones,
After we too, my love, are only ruins,
Let us lie like these stones singing in the sun,
Leading others to love along our vanished ways.


Your womb is smarter than your head,
And as smart as your bottom.
See—
The fierce black grace
Of your naked body.
You are the symbol of the forest,
With your red necklaces,
Your bracelets of curving gold,
And the dark alligator
Swimming in the Zambezi of your eyes.




I remember you as you were that last autumn—
Your grey beret, your calm heart,
And the flames of sunset wrestling in your eyes,
And the leaves falling into the waters of your soul.
You clung to my arm like a vine.
The leaves caught up your slow calm voice—
Vertiginous hearth where my heart blazes—
Sweet blue hyacinth twisting over my soul.
I can feel your eyes, voyaging away, distant as that autumn,
Grey beret, voice of a bird, heart of a huntress—
Where all my deep agony migrated,
Where my happy kisses fell like embers.
The skies from shipboard. Fields from the hills.
Your memory is of light, of smoke, of a still pool.
Deep in your eyes the twilights burned.
The dry leaves of autumn whirled in your soul.

I have shut my windows.
I do not want to hear the weeping.
But from behind the grey walls,
Nothing is heard but the weeping.
There are few angels that sing.
There are few dogs that bark.
A thousand violins fit in the palm of the hand.
But the weeping is an immense angel.
The weeping is an immense dog.
The weeping is an immense violin.
Tears strangle the wind.
Nothing is heard but the weeping.




Facing the palm of fire
Which spreads from the departing sun
Throughout the silent evening—
In this garden of peace—
While flowery Valencia
Drinks the Guadalquiver—
Valencia of slender towers
In the young skies of Ausias March,
Your river changes to roses
At the touch of the sea.
I think of the war. War
Has swept like a tornado
Through the steppes of high Douro,
Through the plains of growing bread,
From fertile Estramadura
To the gardens of lemon trees,
From the grey skies of Asturias
To the marshes of light and salt.
I think that Spain has been sold out,
River by river, mountain by mountain, sea by sea.




Understand that they were sitting just inside the door
At a little table with two full beers and two empties.
There were a few dozen people moving around, killing
Time and getting tight because nothing meant anything
Anymore
Somebody looked at a girl and somebody said
 Great things doing in Spain
But she didn’t even look up, not so much as half an eye.
Then Jack picked up his beer and Nellie her beer
And their legs ground together under the table.
Somebody looked at the clock and somebody said
 Great things doing in Russia
A cop and two whores came in and he bought only two drinks
Because one of them had syphilis
No one knows just why it happened or whether
It would happen ever again on this fretful earth
But Jack picked up his beer again and Nellie her beer again
And, as though at signal, a little man hurried in,
Crossed to the bar and said Hello Steve to the barkeeper.


The Dove walks with sticky feet
Upon the green crowns of the almond tree,
Its feathers smeared over with warmth
Like honey
That dips lazily down into the shadow . . .
Anyone standing in that orchard,
So filled with peace and sleep,
Would hardly have noticed the hill
Nearby
With its three strange wooden arms
Lifted above a throng of motionless people
—Above the helmets of Pilate’s soldiers
Flashing like silver teeth in the sun."

Her Steps are succinct and practical and

are not to be taken in any certain order. The first step for one may be the last step for another. So just take whatever steps seem easiest for you and as you take a few steps it will become easier for you to take a few more (Peace Pilgrim, 1982, p.9).

There are four preparations:

* right attitude toward life.
* bringing our lives into harmony with the laws that govern this universe.
* finding one's special place in the universe through inner guidance.
* simplification of life.

There are four purifications:

* of body
* of thoughts
* of desires
* of motivations

There are four relinquishments:

* of self-will
* of the feeling of separateness
* of all attachments
* of all negative feelings (pp.9-20)

Peace gives further advice: ""The path of gradual relinquishment...is a difficult path, for only when relinquishment is complete do the rewards really come. The path of quick relinquishments is an easy path, for it brings immediate blessings."" (p.21)

The late sixties and early seventies saw Suknaski produce work for at least ten concrete poetry chapbooks (including two anthologies) while publishing many titles by others (Dennis Lee, Stephen Scobie, bp Nichol, Earle Birney, and Sid Marty, to name a few) as well with his own Elfin Plot Press. He floated poems and magazines rolled up in Al Purdy’s cigar tubes down the North Saskatchewan River. He folded an issue of Elfin Plot into paper airplanes and had them dropped from an aircraft flying north out of Edmonton. He buried others on mountaintops, or left them on beaches melted into tablet-like candles abandoned for strangers: something to light them home. It was undoubtedly actions like these that prompted Douglas Barbour’s wry comment that Elfin Plot was “the most underground of underground magazines. The output during this time was frenetic, sprawling, brilliant, compulsive and voluminous, especially considering his transitory lifestyle and constant poverty.nathalie stephens
No text is sacred. Nothing is ever for real. The earth shifts beneath our feet. We are walking in circles looking again and again at the same thing.


Davis (1996, emphasis added):

""I've gradually smoothed over this more radical [ontological panpsychic] stance by strategically adopting methodological views (Arjun Appadurai and Igor Kopytoff's cultural biographies of things, Stanley Fish's reader-response theory of literary meaning) that would enable me to tell my biographical stories, and would at the same time domesticate my living objects within acceptable Western intellectual approaches. ""Biographies"" thus becomes a strategic metaphor for narrating the historical processes that surround objects over time, rather than the dead serious, non-metaphorical telling of an actual life of an embodied iconic being. Yet I don't think that means that I entirely abandon my images to Western conceptualizations. In centering the book around stories, lives of individual objects that have led and continue to lead interesting and varied lives, I hope that there is a cumulative persuasive effect that I'm not using ""lives"" metaphorically or ironically, but as the expression of a serious ontological premise. My aim is that an accomodation between two different ideas of how images might in fact be alive will emerge over the course of the book.""

Military Malignancy
In Context: U.S. Military Spending Versus Rest of the World

Consider the following:

The above sources compare the given fiscal year budget request with the latest figures for other countries, which are sometimes two years old. Still using those statistics for other countries, however, a comparison can be made here of the US Fiscal Year 2005 spending against other equivalent data:

* The US military spending was almost two-fifths of the total.
* The US military spending was almost 7 times larger than the Chinese budget, the second largest spender.
* The US military budget was almost 29 times as large as the combined spending of the six “rogue states (Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria) who spent $14.65 billion.
* It was more than the combined spending of the next 14 nations.
* The United States and its close allies accounted for some two thirds to three-quarters of all military spending, depending on who you count as close allies (typically NATO countries, Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan and South Korea)
* The six potential “enemies, Russia, and China together spent $139 billion, 30% of the U.S. military budget.

Some of the above statistics come from organizations such as the Center for Defense Information, and the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. They often include a global comparison. The one for Fiscal Year 2007 has been produced as a graph here:

On Lionel Kearns -
vispo 

He is a Linguist. Which is interesting because one of the reasons I became so excited about his work is he seems to understand that there has been a synthesis going on, over the last seventy years, more or less commencing with the work of Godel and Turing, between number and language, between mathematics and language studies, between the arts and sciences, between any pair of fields that code their material in such a way that it can be turned into information. Kearns is a language man. Kearns is a real thinker. Kearns is a media man. Kearns is a polyartist. Kearns has been contemporary since the mid sixties. I can't think of any other poets from around here except maybe bp Nichol who might have written anything in the sixties about digital poetics and issues.
Kali's Child 

Also relevant here is the manner in which my dialectical category of ""the erotic"" has been misread by some as flatly monodimensional, as if it meant simply ""sex,"" when in fact the erotic only begins with physical sexuality and moves out (really ""up"") from there into the sublime, ""sublimated"" realms of symbolic vision, mystical experience, mythology and theology. I could, no doubt, address such a misunderstanding in the same way that Freud answered his own critics. In an effort to show that his own concept of ""libido"" was not the ""outrageous innovation"" that people supposed it to be, the analyst called attention to how sexuality lay in an unbroken continuum with the ""higher aims"" of ""love for parents and children, friendship and love for humanity in general, and also devotion to concrete objects and to abstract ideas.""All these tendencies,"" Freud writes, ""are an expresson of the same instinctual impulses.""13 Then, as if to move even higher ""up"" along the continuum, Freud invokes--appropriately, I would argue--the erotic mysticism of Plato and the love theology of Paul: ""In its origin, function, and relation to sexual love,"" he wrote, ""the 'Eros' of the philosopher Plato coincides exactly with the love-force, the libido of psycho-analysis . . . and when the apostle Paul, in his famous epistle to the Corinthians, praises love above all else, he certainly understands it in the same 'wider' sense.""14
adi da
AVATAR ADI DA SAMRAJ: There is a fundamental fear of being without a world. You are constantly servicing the impulse to always have a world and also to have that world be basically comfortable.

That impulse underlies all forms of ""cosmic religion"" — or the religion of preserving beings in the cosmic domain, of granting everybody a world and making the world more and more congenial by at least getting rid of darker influences.

The ""Perfect Practice"" of the Way of Adidam, however, is not about ""having a world"". It is about entering into the Domain That Is Prior to the cosmic domain.

People generally do not have the disposition for such a practice. As long as there is identification with the body-mind, you do not want there to be no world. In fact, you insist that there be a world — and that it be congenial to you. Therefore, you will not relinquish your world.

In other words, you will not accept the Position you are actually in, the Position That Transcends the conditional (or cosmic) domain, until your craven attachment to the body-mind (and, therefore, to having a world that is congenial) relaxes profoundly, such that you know the world for what it is and (thereby) realize a native detachment.

Then the ""Perfect Practice"" can begin.

Words Made Flesh
WORDS MADE FLESH
Code, Culture, Imagination
Florian Cramer

A b s t r a c t: Executable code existed centuries before the invention of the computer in magic, Kabbalah, musical composition and experimental poetry. These practices are often neglected as a historical pretext of contemporary software culture and electronic arts. Above all, they link computations to a vast speculative imagination that encompasses art, language, technology, philosophy and religion. These speculations in turn inscribe themselves into the technology. Since even the most simple formalism requires symbols with which it can be expressed, and symbols have cultural connotations, any code is loaded with meaning. This booklet writes a small cultural history of imaginative computation, reconstructing both the obsessive persistence and contradictory mutations of the phantasm that symbols turn physical, and words are made flesh.

Autopoesis 

Autopoesis

Autopoesis is both a concept about self-maintaining systems, especially biological ones, and an epistemological theory about cognition and self-reference.

Humberto Maturana and F. J. Varela proposed the concept of autopoesis (as opposed to allopoetic) as the organization of living things, which maintains their lasting unity and wholeness in the midst of continual turnover of constituents, specifically through self-production. For them, autopoesis is the necessary and sufficient condition for the minimal units of life. Autopoesis defines the minimal mechanistic features of the simplest possible living entity. It describes ""how life works."" All living systems are autopoetic, and all physical systems, if autopoetic, can be said to be living.

Physicist Freeman Dyson of the Institute for Advanced Study estimates that, within 200 years or so, we should attain Type I status. In fact, growing at a modest rate of 1% per year, Kardashev estimated that it would take only 3,200 years to reach Type II status, and 5,800 years to reach Type III status. Living in a Type I,II, or III civilization

For example, a Type I civilization is a truly planetary one, which has mastered most forms of planetary energy. Their energy output may be on the order of thousands to millions of times our current planetary output.

It looks like a four-armed starfish, but so far it's unaware of its own shape. After flailing its arms for a while, however, the robot gets a sense of its design and begins to walk. The real feat comes when engineers remove a part of its leg: The robot senses a change in its structure and begins walking in a different way to compensate. The demonstration is the first proof that a robot can generate a conception of itself and then adapt to damage, a handy skill to have in unpredictable environments.

The rhizome is that which: ""connects any point to any other point, and its traits are not necessarily linked to traits of the same nature; it brings into play very different regimes of signs, and even nonsign states... It is composed not of units but of dimensions, or rather directions in motion. It has neither beginning nor end, but always a milieu from which it grows and which it overspills... The rhizome proceeds by variation, expansion, conquest, capture, offshoots... the rhizome pertains to a map that... is always detachable, connectable, reversible, modifiable, and has multiple entryways and exits""

Remote Control Device 'Controls' Humans 

Nippon Telegraph Telephone Corp., Japans top telephone company, says it is developing the technology to perhaps make video games more realistic. But more sinister applications also come to mind.

I can envision it being added to militaries' arsenals of so-called ""non-lethal"" weapons.

A special headset was placed on my cranium by my hosts during a recent demonstration at an NTT research center. It sent a very low voltage electric current from the back of my ears through my head _ either from left to right or right to left, depending on which way the joystick on a remote-control was moved.

I found the experience unnerving and exhausting: I sought to step straight ahead but kept careening from side to side. Those alternating currents literally threw me off.

The technology is called galvanic vestibular stimulation _ essentially, electricity messes with the delicate nerves inside the ear that help maintain balance.

epigenetics --Endocrinology (Journal) 

""Transient exposure of a gestating female rat during the period of sex determination to the endocrine disruptor vinclozolin (ie anti-androgenic endocrine disruptor used as a fungicide in the fruit industry) induced an adult phenotype in the first F1 generation of breast tumors, prostate disease, kidney disease, immune abnormalities and premature aging. These adult onset diseases were transferred through the male germ-line to 85% of all males of all subsequent generations examined (ie F1-F4). "" 

In other words, pollution's effects on the body can be inherited. It's called epigenetics.

""...with Leibniz the question surges forth in philosophy that will continue to haunt Whitehead and Bergson: not how to attain eternity, but in what conditions does the objective world allow for a subjective production of novelty, that is, of creation?

The best of all worlds is not the one that reproduces the eternal, but the one in which new creations are produced, the one endowed with a capacity for innovation or creativity: a teleological conversion of philosophy.""

Th Illusion of Conscious Will 

Daniel Wegner: ""How do people come to understand their actions as their own? Common sense tells us we know when actions are ours because we have caused them; we are intrinsically informed of what we do by our conscious will. But it turns out people can be mistaken about their own authorship....people will feel they are the source of action when they think about that action in advance of its occurrence, and alternative sources of the action are not known. This theory calls into question the common sense view that conscious will is the cause of action.""

How and why do the ways of reading poetry in the UK that are most publicly visible still exclude work that is aesthetically and linguistically radical? What is the history of these models of reading poetry, and what is their relationship to marketing? What are the key sites of influence and how do they work (as cultural practices and as forms of power)? Why have recent moves, for example in Poetry Review, to give some recognition to the range of British poetries aroused such hostile responses? What is at stake? What are the possibilities for real change? What types of writing and publishing are offering alternative economies of reading to those that postmodern capitalism benefits from?

many people play over 40 hours a week -
and when people play, they help label images on the Web with descriptive keywords. These keywords can be used to significantly improve the accuracy of image search. People play the game not because they want to help, but because they enjoy it.

I describe other examples of ""games with a purpose"": Peekaboom, which helps determine the location of objects in images, and Verbosity, which collects common-sense knowledge. I also explain a general approach for constructing games with a purpose.

If wisdom is the union of these two, their separation implies a loss of meaning,
a fall into absurdity.

organic information design 

""Design techniques for static information are well understood, their descriptions and discourse thorough and well-evolved. But these techniques fail when dynamic information is considered. There is a space of highly complex systems for which we lack deep understanding because few techniques exist for visualization of data whose structure and content are continually changing. To approach these problems, this thesis introduces a visualization process titled Organic Information Design. The resulting systems employ simulated organic properties in an interactive, visually refined environment to glean qualitative facts from large bodies of quantitative data generated by dynamic information sources.""

This site has been implicated in the savant condition. Ten participants improved their ability to accurately guess the number of discrete items immediately following rTMS and, of these, eight became worse at guessing as the effects of the pulses receded. The probability of as many as eight out of twelve people doing best just after rTMS and not after sham stimulation by chance alone is less than one in one thousand.""

""The idea of notation implies, if not demands, performance. Virtually any form of writing is a kind of notation and any form of reading is a type of performance.

all of which, in a tribal context, are read.

Culture and the Individual 
Thanks to language and culture, human behavior can be incomparably more intelligent, more original, creative and flexible than the behavior of animals, whose brains are too small to accommodate the number of neurons necessary for the invention of language and the transmission of accumulated knowledge. But, thanks again to language and culture, human beings often behave with a stupidity, a lack of realism, a total inappropriateness, of which animals are incapable.[Aldous Huxley.

unfinish! is the battle cry and the curse of digital work that knows no conclusion, but only consecutive versions. A paradigm of digital culture?

Are you ready to unfinish your world? 


transmediale.07 / Keynote: Stelarc 
An ear has been surgically constructed on his arm. The intention with this soft prosthesis is to wirelessly connect it to the internet to enable it to become a listening device for remote others. Stelarc considers the ear prosthesis not as a sign of physical malfunction, but rather as a symbol for an additional feature 
not a sign of loss but rather a symptom of excess. Thus he tries to amplify the forms and functions of the human body, exposing its obsolescence and producing a human-machine-hybrid which questions the notion of the architecture, engineering and operation of the human body.

""Doctors take nerves that used to go to the arm and move those nerves onto chest muscles. The nerves grow into the chest muscles, so when the patient thinks “close hand, a portion of his chest muscle contracts and electrodes that detect this muscle activity tell the computerized arm when to close the hand.""

[Source: Wands, B. (2006). Art of the Digital Age. London: Thames & Hudson. ]C. John Holcombe : ""And the relevance to literature? It may be that poems themselves are strange attractors. There are many similarities. Poems organize themselves. The writer submits words to the embryonic arrangement of the poem — a phrase, a conjectured verse form, intellectual argument, controlling emotion — but thereafter the poem takes over, creating an arrangement of words that is not easily changed. Poets often produce cycle of poems, recognizable in theme and form, but differing slightly from poem to poem. Literary periods also see these cycles of creation: a common technique or subject matter or Zeitgeist. Strange attractors have exactly these properties: similarities but not repetitions, an independence, a reluctance to shift far from their previous shape and position.""

The explicative potency of non-linear dynamics applied to poetry is well-established.

Numerous mathematician poets exist. Princeton mathematician, complex systems research and poet Philip Holmes' presentation ""What Do Poems and Differential Equations Share? Some Thoughts on Metaphors and Models."" explores the terrain at the convergence of poetry and applied mathematics.

POSTLANGUAGE POETRY:
""...literature is too multi-faceted, rambunctious, and iconoclastic to fit the limits of any definition... Literary theory does continue to be a central part of the practice of many postlanguage poets, yet they tend to undertake it with an ambivalent and often wearied eye....Thus, while narrative, lyric, spirituality, and a poetics of the everyday appear often as elements that language poets think should be rejected, postlanguage poets such as Juliana Spahr, Susan Smith Nash, Jefferson Hansen, Liz Willis, Peter Gizzi, Chris Stroffolino, Jennifer Moxley, Joe Ross, Lisa Jarnot, myself and many others have been consciously using one or several of these elements in their work, without returning to the sort of naive justifications of those elements that continue to be a feature of more mainstream American poetry.""

The pictograph for ""water"" pronounced nu became the symbol for the consonantal sound of N.; This practice of using a pictograph to stand for the first sound in the word it stood for is called acrophony and was the first step in the development of an ALPHABET or the ""One Sign-One sound"" system of writing.

Technologies of Writing
""The phrase 'technologies of writing' refers not to the script or alphabet, the calligraphic or marking system that a text employs, but to the practical methods by which these systems are applied—pencil, brush, quill, ink, paint, print, machine key and pixel—and to the material surfaces and sites of writing itself—clay, animal skin, parchment, linen, wood pulp and cyberspace.""

""The invention of writing is probably the most important tool for human advancement, making it possible for each new generation to build upon the work of the previous, to transmit knowledge from person to person, across cultures and time.""
Don NormanELO Symposium 2007


Book History is devoted to every aspect of the history of the book, broadly defined as the history of the creation, dissemination, and reception of script and print.

electronicbookreview.comWriting.3D Editor's Introduction:
""...a three-dimensional text – whether it be presented in the immersive reading environment of a Cave, a game space, a QuickTime video, or a Javascript poem – requires an adaptive flexibility that we might even call a new mode of reading, a 'deep reading.' ""

Gary Snyder: ""...artists have a role in society, which is to contribute to the community — to the heart of the community.""

""You have been searching for us without knowing it, following oblique references in crudely xeroxed marginal ""samsidat"" publications, crackpot mystical pamphlets, mail order courses ... a paper trail and a coded series of rumors spread at street level ... and the propagation of certain acts of insurrection against the Planetary Work Machine and the Consensus Reality ... or perhaps through various obscure mimeographed technical papers on the edges of ""chaos science"" ... through pirate computer networks ... or even through pure synchronicity and the pursuit of dreams. In any case we know something about you, your interests, deeds and desires, works and days ... and we know your address. Otherwise...you would not be reading this...""

The Incunabula Papers: Ong's Hat
""A man of my occupation seldom claims a systematic mode of thinking; at worst, he claims to have a system 
but even that, in his case, is borrowing from a milieu, from a social order, or from the pursuit of philosophy at a tender age. Nothing convinces an artist more of the arbitrariness of the means to which he resorts to attain a goal 
however permanent it may be 
than the creative process itself, the process of composition."" (Nobel Lecture. 1987)

Marvin Minsky:
No one finds it surprising these days when we make machines that do logical things, because logic is based on clear, simple rules of the sorts that computers can easily use. But Love, by its nature, some people would say, cannot be explained in mechanical ways — nor could we ever make machines that possess any such human capacities as feelings, emotions, and consciousness...""

""...emotional states are not especially different from the processes that we call 'thinking'...""(p.6)

""How might new technologies and the metaphors of science be employed in the education of the artist? How might the insights of the artist contribute to the advancement of knowledge in science and to technological development? (Ask not what science can do for art but what art can do for science!). How can the accrued wisdom of exotic or ancient cultures be allied to the search for meaning and values in a post-biological society? How might new technologies serve to support and sustain cultures that lie beyond the Western paradigm? How might the Net serve the needs of interactive, non-linear, transdisciplinary learning, and engender creative thought and constructive action?""

""MAKING PROFOUND ART"" by Andrew Wielawski 
These were the words of the Dreamer, who told me that the future doesn’t exist, because it hasn’t happened yet, and the past is gone. The world as we know it doesn’t exist, either, because it is only our own projection of chemical electrical impulses onto the screen of our brains. It is not the events as they happened, only a time delayed and heavily filtered rendition of them.

With a philosophical view like this, it is only a matter of taking things one step further to see how much freedom we have through our art.

And burnt up by love of beauty, 
I shall not have the splendid honour 
Of giving my name to the abyss 
Which will serve as my grave.

How to Write a Scientific Paper 

Abstract

We (meaning I) present observations on the scientific publishing process

which (meaning that) are important and timely in that unless I have more

published papers soon, I will never get another job. These observations

are consistent with the theory that it is difficult to do good science, write

good scientific papers, and have enough publications to get future jobs.

Conjecture : Information-Sucking Reflex
""Alongside the innate physical sucking reflex for obtaining milk to be digested, decomposed and used all over the body for growth, repair, and energy, there is a genetically determined information-sucking reflex, which seeks out, sucks in, and decomposes information, which is later recombined in many ways, growing the information-processing architecture and many diverse recombinable competences. Our educational system and other factors (e.g. mind-binding cultures) often interfere with this process, unfortunately.
A big mistake made by governments and educational theorists is to assume that there's a right order in which to grow the architecture, etc. A system building a complex structure may have to assemble different substructures in a sequence that is opportunistic and ideosyncratic. Educational systems that do not allow for this can do a lot of damage through excessive regimentation, e.g. based on use of 'targets'. ""

A skeuomorph is a design feature, no longer functional in itself, that refers back to an avatar that was functional at an earlier time. The dashboard of my Toyota Camry, for example, is covered by vinyl molded to simulate stitching; the simulated stitching alludes back to a fabric that was in fact stitched, although it no longer serves that function in my car. Skeuomorphs visibly testify to the social or psychological necessity for innovation to be tempered by replication.

""...a statistically significant property has been reported about the organization of human language. In spite of the huge number of words that can be stored by a human, any word in the lexicon can be reached with fewer than three intermediate words, on average.

...the graph connecting words in language shows the same statistical features as other complex networks. The short distance between words arising from the SW[Small World] structure indicates that language evolution might have involved the selection of a particular arrangement of connections between words.

If the SW features derive from optimal navigation needs... words the main purpose of which is to speed-up navigation must exist... According to our calculations, the 10 most connected words are `and’, `the’, `of ’, `in’, `a’, `to’, `’s’, `with’, `by’ and `is’. These words are characterized by a very low or zero semantic content.""

""Much of the novel's alleged power is embedded in the line, that compulsory author-directed movement from the beginning of a sentence to its period, from the top of the page to the bottom, from the first page to the last. Of course, through print's long history, there have been countless strategies to counter the line's power, from marginalia and footnotes to the creative innovations of novelists like Laurence Sterne, James Joyce, Raymond Queneau, Julio Cortazar, Italo Calvino and Milorad Pavic, not to exclude the form's father, Cervantes himself. But true freedom from the tyranny of the line is perceived as only really possible now at last with the advent of hypertext, written and read on the computer, where the line in fact does not exist unless one invents and implants it in the text.""

Born in 1870 in Brno, Moravia, his stonemason father died when he was only nine. A rebellious, disorientated boy, he failed in various attempts to get through architecture school. Contracting syphilis in the brothels of Vienna, by 21 he was sterile and in 1893 his mother disowned him. He went to America and for three years and did odd jobs in New York, somehow finding himself in that process and returning to Vienna in 1896 a man of taste and intellectual refinement, immediately entering the fashionable Viennese intelligentsia. His friends included Ludwig Wittgenstein, Arnold Schönberg, and Karl Kraus. He quickly established himself as the preferred architect of Vienna’s cultured bourgeoisie. Diagnosed with cancer in 1918, his stomach, appendix and part of his intestine were removed. For the rest of his life he could only digest ham and cream. He had several unhappy marriages. By the time he was fifty he was almost completely deaf; in 1928 he was disgraced by a paedophilia scandal and at his death in 1933 at 63 he was penniless[2]. He died in Kalksburg near Vienna.

Featuring works that transform books through a variety of mediums, Book/Shelf stresses an expanded notion of the illustrated book. The exhibition begins with a documentation of Marcel Duchamp's Unhappy Readymade (1919)—a work created when the artist, while traveling, asked his sister back home to hang a geometry book on his balcony in order to let the wind flip and tear the pages. It continues with works in which artists appropriate books by others, such as a sculpture by Martin Kippenberger made partly of books, and a copy of Duchamp's catalogue raisonné rebound by David Hammons under the title Holy Bible. Artists who tackle the idea of books in film (William Wegman), sound works (On Kawara), prints (Edward Ruscha), and drawings (Steve Wolfe) are represented as well. Finally, the exhibition surveys a number of artists who have created installations that display books in public contexts, including Brian Belott, Allen Ruppersberg, Josh Smith, and Lawrence Weiner.

Collected Essays(part19)
That grisly thing, a “poetry reading, is what it is because there will always be some among the audience who are bored or all but frankly hostile and who can’t remove themselves by the simple act of turning a knob. And it is at bottom the same difficulty—the fact that a theatre audience is not a selected one—that makes it impossible to get a decent performance of Shakespeare in England. On the air these conditions do not exist. The poet FEELS that he is addressing people to whom poetry means something, and it is a fact that poets who are used to broadcasting can read into the microphone with a virtuosity they would not equal if they had a visible audience in front of them. The element of make-believe that enters here does not greatly matter. The point is that in the only way now possible the poet has been brought into a situation in which reading verse aloud seems a natural unembarrassing thing, a normal exchange between man and man: also he has been led to think of his work as SOUND rather than as a pattern on paper. By that much the reconciliation between poetry and the common man is nearer. It already exists at the poet’s end of the aether-waves, whatever may be happening at the other end.

Poetry interests me above all as a kind of resistence. In the first place because its economy is absolutely aberrant to contemporary logic: an enormous investment (in terms of time and energy), quasi-nil effect and zero profitability. So it’s an act that could only be directed by internal necessity...

Teemu Ikonen: Moving text in avant-garde poetry. Towards a poetics of textual motion
In the last decades of the 20th century many writers have been interested in the expressional possibilities offered by the democratization of the moving image, especially by the video media. One result from this is the video poetry developed, among others, by E.M. Melo e Castro, Richard Kostelanetz and Arnaldo Antunes from the 60’s onwards. If one were to trace a thorough history of the virtual textual motion, the tradition of video and multimedia poetry should be taken into consideration. On the other hand, it could also be fruitful to examine how video artists have experimented with the so-called natural language and linguistic articulation. Here I’m thinking especially of Gary Hill

Cummings' 1944 collection, ""I X I,"" it became clear that one of the few seemingly appropriate ways to ""analyze"" a poet whose core relation is a belief in love and feeling over thought, would be to create a mode through which I could explore his poetry that would remain true to the poet's writing.""

Screening Room was a 1970s Boston television series that for almost ten years offered independent filmmakers a chance to show and discuss their work on a commercial (ABC-TV) affiliate station. The series was developed and hosted by filmmaker Robert Gardner (Dead Birds, Forest of Bliss), who was Chairman of the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies and Director of the Carpenter Center for Visual Arts at Harvard for many years. This unique program dealt even-handedly with animation, documentary, and experimental film, welcoming such artists as Jan Lenica, John and Faith Hubley, Emile DeAntonio, Jean Rouch, Ricky Leacock, Jonas Mekas, Bruce Baillie, Yvonne Rainer and Michael Snow. Frequently, guests such as Octavio Paz, Stanley Cavell, and Rudolph Arnheim appeared as well. The filmmakers presented on the show are now considered the most influential contributors to modern experimental film, documentary, and animation.

Our situation is this: most of the people in this world believe that the Creator of the universe has written a book. We have the misfortune of having many such books on hand, each making an exclusive claim as to its infallibility. People tend to organize themselves into factions according to which of these incompatible claims they accept rather than on the basis of language, skin color, location of birth, or any other criterion of tribalism. Each of these texts urges its readers to adopt a variety of beliefs and practices, some of which are benign, many of which are not. All are in perverse agreement on one point of fundamental importance, however: respect for other faiths, or for the views of unbelievers, is not an attitude that God endorses.

""Transform the traditional dissertation. In the arts and humanities, where looming cutbacks will be most devastating, there is no longer a market for books modeled on the medieval dissertation, with more footnotes than text. As financial pressures on university presses continue to mount, publication of dissertations, and with it scholarly certification, is almost impossible. (The average university press print run of a dissertation that has been converted into a book is less than 500, and sales are usually considerably lower.) For many years, I have taught undergraduate courses in which students do not write traditional papers but develop analytic treatments in formats from hypertext and Web sites to films and video games. Graduate students should likewise be encouraged to produce “theses in alternative formats."" (Mark C. Taylor. April 26, 2009)

""The concept of poem as an open diagram, when it incorporates the notions of plurality, interrelationship and reciprocity of codes, not only guarantees the viability of poetry in a society subject to constant technological revolutions, but places it in a privileged position -> that of an universal progressive poetry (as Schlegel foresaw) or simply: poiesis (from greek = creation, making).""""The bacterial communication phenomenon that we study is called quorum sensing, which is a process that allows bacteria to communicate using secreted chemical signaling molecules called autoinducers. This process enables a population of bacteria to collectively regulate gene expression and, therefore, behavior. ... quorum sensing is a mechanism that allows bacteria to function as multi-cellular organisms."

Instead of comparing viruses, we compare languages and instead of DNA, we look for shared cognates – words that have a common origin, such as “mother, “mutter and “madre – across various Indo-European languages. We use the cognates to infer a family tree of the languages and, together with information about the location of each language, we trace back through time to infer the location at the root of the tree – the origin of Indo-European.""

This piece was created by scanning electron microscopy. The lines of the gradually self-reducing anagram poem were printed on a semiconductor device sample of Germanium and Silicon dioxide. The lines of the poem were written by a focus Ga ion beam into the sample. Placed into the microscope, the sequences of images were scanned by electrons at ranges from 400x all the way to 10000x. The first line was taken from the manual of the focused ion beam imaging system.Teaching in the Margins: Michael Joyce 

""In conferences and class salons (the term I’ve taken to using, rather than workshops, for writing classes) I often perplex students by asking of a poem or a piece of fiction of theirs, “What do you want it to do? At first this is confusing (voila succès!) and they tend to respond in terms of meanings, motifs, internal rhythms and the like, against which I push back, insisting that, if writing is to be anything, it must first be an action in this world. This is a standard I hold myself to as well, and which in my writing I most often fail to meet, finding dark consolation in Beckett’s “Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.""

The ancient Sanskrit-speaking civilization envisioned akasha as a metaphysical information network connecting humanity with itself and infinite knowledge. In this paradigm, thoughts, ideas, feelings, and experiences are stored forever and shared through the ether, which acts as an universal field connecting multiple planes of existence.

Thousands of years later we have created a modern information network openly connecting humans with each other and perpetual knowledge.https://akasha.world/  n th toxik pools surrounding us mooving closr in

On Tuesday July 4th I purchased a Google Daydream headset. The cashier informed me at checkout it was unreturnable if the box was opened. No worries: it only cost 100$ and I intended to keep it, to bring it to University of Bergen in Norway for a VR seminar and use it as a cheap comfortable untethered VR viewing device for some demos I had made.

Daydream is designed specifically for the Google Pixel phone. I had bought the Pixel because I like vanilla stock Android (I like it so much I previously owned a Nexus and a Nexus 6P). An OS apparently without any corporate cruft. Yet I was about to learn how the internet of things circumvents apparent transparency. Daydream would become a nightmare.

That afternoon I slotted my phone into the Daydream device with a demo I’d made using Mozilla’s A-Frame, a lightweight webvr toolkit (based on the JavaScript library for 3D manipulation called Three.js). A-Frame allows for quick deployment of VR in a browser.

Sweet. Wonderful. It worked. I spent the afternoon developing and that evening cycled over to a friend who works as a knowledge broker at Concordia University. Sitting in his backyard under the trees, he experienced 3 of my webvr demos using the Daydream headset. I was pleased. Situation normal. The headset was easy to open and close, the head strap comfortable, the viewing quality reasonable. I was happy with my purchase.

On Tuesday July 5th, I decided to test out a VR work made specifically for the Daydream headset (made by folks I know, Samantha Gorman and Danny Cannizzaro from Tender Claws) called Virtual Virtual Reality.

Virtual Virtual Reality proved to be exquisitely interesting, clever, professional, well-written and engaging. A joy to experience. Intimidatingly proficient. Ironically subversive.

I was enthralled. On June 29th, A-Frame announced link traversals that included support for the Daydream controller. I was looking forward to playing around, creating some quick demos.

But that’s when the trouble began. Pairing the controller and installing the dedicated Daydream app eradicated the capacity to use webvr demos I had hosted on my site, even the ones I had previously viewed in the headset. When I loaded my browser demos and put my Pixel into the headset, it now auto launched a pairing process, then switched to the Daydream app.

No biggie. I figured I just had to reset it somehow. Check app settings. Nothing. Enable flags for webvr and gamepad api in Chrome. Restart. Unsolved. Hmm. Uninstall Daydream. Restart. Put phone in headset, Android now prompted me to install Daydream. Uh-to.

The Origins Trail

Now I began to sweat. Search for a solution led to the PlayCanvas website, a platform tool for creating VR (initiated by Google, it costs $15 per month to have any export capacity). And the Origins Trails process where Google sanctioned select key developers to use this experimental webvr functionality inside their headset (“Implement a framework for exposing experimental features in the browser, but only to specific/registered origins, for limited duration and subject to global usage caps). The rationale for this from a dev perspective is presented here.

Bottom line (as i understand it): only webvr projects sanctioned by Google work within the Daydream headset. It’s as if you bought a radio or a TV set that would only play channels approved by the manufacturer. What’s happened to the freedom of the web? Is content equivalent to an app? The headset is just a set of lens.

The Internet of Silos.

So I made a painful decision, I reset my Pixel phone to factory defaults. I was hoping to return to that evening in my friend’s backyard under the trees, using Daydream as a comfortable untethered lightweight webvr viewing utility, forget about the controller. The purity of Android could not fail me. Yet it did. Placing the reset-to-factory-default phone in the headset, immediately triggered the same irreversible context switch: “Daydream install required. In order to play… Please update.

There are two levels of resetting Android. I had done the soft reset. So I tried to do the hard reset. It failed. Brainless brick.

Corporate Curated Consciousness

Result: I slowly realized that if I enable the webvr flags in chrome, it cannot view webvr stereoscopically hosted on my site: thus even Cardboard is worthless for demos. With webvr flags enabled, the stereoscopic launch button no longer works unless I visit google-approved webvr. Nightly Firefox does not function in stereoscopic any more: why? Who knows.

I am stranded with a corporate headset that curates content, jealously guarding its portal. Radical infantilism. Reality reloaded with a subset of Reality controlled by geeks and brand marketers. Ironically it echoes the storyline of the Virtual Virtual Reality project where VR headsets defined by corporate ideology define reality.

How? My suspicion is the headset after the first launch of the Daydream app passively inserted the Bluetooth ID of my phone into an on-device storage array. The headset now knows my phone. It does not care about its OS or factory reset.

Android bypassed. Lock initialized. Object to object. Thing to thing silo.

Unremovable solitude. Implacable logos.

Google famous motto is “Don’t be Evil. Hannah Arendt famously noted the banality of evil. In a future where information/ideologies/culture become branded battlefields, constraints on consciousness will arise. A decision made to increase brand loyalty today can sprout future tyranny. The world is not without auspicious examples: from the Great Firewall of China to the bunkered intelligence services of all great nations, control proliferates to apparently protect. Insidious bureaucracies slide into authoritarianism.

Jealousy is one of the deepest instincts of the psyche. The song of Solomon speaks of the bitter fire that burns thereof as worse than the taste of death. Ownership‘s primordial glandular fury flexes it’s muscles. Sculpting opportunities within commodities into contemporary shackles.

Banal evil arises when interface design succumbs to corporate imperatives.

Brand chastity.

Interoperability issues, incompatible formats, silos. It’s not new.

Instagram, Snapchat, Uber, Maps: gated. Share something from Evernote on a phone, and it’s impossible to leave the silo. Load a webpage or video through Facebook and it’s lovingly wrapped in their very own branding, links and data mining sauce. All brands do it. The larger the corporation, the more likely you can never leave it’s boundaries and that the border will be guarded and exact a fee of time. The banality of evil.

It has become a truism to recognize that corporations grasp at usage data. It’s normative tedium, cages masquerading as loyalty bonus.

My favorite company to critique in this regard is Apple. I have a MacBook Air,. I love it. It is a wonderful rugged piece of technology, an agile jeep sliding over code surfaces. But the Apple urge to encapsulate consumer self often feels manipulative, click bait designed to prevent miscegenation with other devices. iTunes is border control. Back at headquarters they want you to live and die within the Apple ecosystem.

Unfortunately I use 5 computers with 4 operating systems: OSX, Windows, Linux, and Android. My life is a field of numb juggling. Squabbling kids. My suspicion is that when a corporation combines software and hardware, the silo grows a wormhole into brand gravity.

VR as PR

This is a story of how I prepared for a VR seminar and how a single hardware purchase resulted in a mild yet annoying software blockade. And how this blockade implies something latent deeper and more pernicious: the potential for corporate decisions to influence self through VR MR AR.

In an ecosystem of informational overlays, when interfaces reflect decisions made for profit, and brand loyalty triumphs over transparency, then culture-silos imply ownership of people. Mind-control is imminent. Google Daydream represents a dangerous precedent for propaganda

Nobody asked him to speak, only that he should hand over his money, but he didn't, saying he had none, and carried on speaking, hesitantly at first, then more fluently, and finally continuously and unstoppably, because the eyes of the seven children had plainly scared him, or, as he himself put it, his stomach had turned in fear, and, as he said, once his stomach was gripped by fear he absolutely had to speak, and furthermore, since the fear had not passed - after all, how could he know whether they were carrying weapons or not - he grew ever more absorbed in his speech, or rather he became ever more absorbed by the idea of telling them everything from beginning to end, of telling someone in any case, because, from the time that he had set out in secret, at the last possible moment, to embark on his "great journey" as he called it, he had not exchanged a word, not a single word, with anyone, considering it too dangerous, though there were few enough people he could engage in conversation in any case, since he hadn't so far met anybody sufficiently harmless, nobody, at least, of whom he was not wary, because in fact there really was nobody harmless enough, which meant he had to be wary of everyone, because, as he had said at the beginning, whoever it was he set eyes on it was the same thing he saw, a figure, that is, who, directly or indirectly, was in contact with those who pursued him, someone related intimately or distantly, but most certainly related, to those who, according to him, kept tabs on his every move, and it was only the speed of his movements, as he later explained, that kept him "at least half a day" ahead of them, though these gains were specific to places and occasions: so he had not said a word to anyone, and only did so now because fear drove him, because it was only under the natural pressure of fear that he ventured into these most important areas of his life, venturing deeper and deeper still, offering them ever more profound glimpses of it in order to defeat them, to make them face him so that he might purge his assailants of the tendency to assail, so he should convince all seven of them that someone had not only given himself up to them, but, with his giving, had somehow outflanked them.

The air was full of the sharp, nauseous smell of tar that cut through everything, nor did the strong wind help because the wind, that had chilled them through to the bone, merely intensified and whipped the smell up without being able to substitute anything else for it in return, the whole neighborhood for several kilometers being thick with it, but here more than anywhere else, for it emanated directly from the Rákos railway yard, from that still visible point where the rails concentrated and began to fan out, ensuring that air and tar would be indistinguishable,  making it very hard to tell what else, apart from soot and smoke, that smell - composed of the hundreds and thousands of trains that rumbled through, the filthy sleepers, the rubble and the metallic stench of the rails - comprised, and it wouldn't be just these but other, more obscure, almost indiscernible ingredients, ingredients without name,  that would certainly have included the weight of human futility ferried here by hundreds and thousands of carriages, the scary and sickening view from the bridge of the power of a million wills bent to a single purpose and, just as certainly, the dreary spirit of desolation and industrial stagnation that had hovered about the place and settled on it decades ago, in all of which Korin was now endeavoring to locate himself, having originally determined simply to cross over to the far side as quickly, silently and inconspicuously as possible in order to escape into what he supposed to be the city center, instead of which he was having, under present circumstances,  to pull himself together at a cold and draughty point of the world, and to hang on to whatever incidental detail he could make out, from his eye-level at any rate, whether this was barrier, curb, asphalt or metal, or appeared the most significant, if only so that this footbridge, some hundred meters from the railway yard, might become a passage between the non-existing to the existing section of the world,  forming therefore an important early adjunct, as his later put it, to his mad life as a fugitive, an bridge that, had he not been detained, he would have rushed obliviously across.

5.
It had begun suddenly, without preamble, without presentiment, preparation or rehearsal, at one specific moment on his forty-fourth birthday, that he was struck, agonizingly and immediately, by the consciousness of it, as suddenly and unexpectedly, he told them, as he was by the appearance of the seven of them here, in the middle of the footbridge, on that day when he was sitting by a river at a spot where he would occasionally sit in any case, this time because he didn't feel like going home to an empty apartment on his birthday, and it really was extremely sudden, the way it struck him that, good heavens, he understood nothing, nothing at all about anything, for Christ's sake, nothing at all about the world, which was a most terrifying realization, he said, especially in the way it came to him in all its banality, vulgarity, at a sickeningly ridiculous level, but this was the point, he said, the way that he, at the age of forty-four, had become aware of how utterly stupid he seemed to himself, how empty, how utterly block-headed he had been in his understanding of the world these last forty-four years, for, as he realized by the river, he had not only misunderstood it, but had not understood anything about anything, the worst part being that for forty-four years he thought he had understood it, while in reality he had failed to do so; and this in fact was the worst thing of all that night of his birthday when he sat alone by the river, the worst because the fact that he now realized that he had not understood it  did not mean that he understand it now, because being aware of his lack of knowledge was not in itself some new form of knowledge for which an older one could be traded in, but one that presented itself as a terrifying puzzle the moment he thought about the world, as he most furiously did that evening, all but torturing himself in the effort to understand it and failing, because the puzzle seemed ever more complex and he had begun to feel that this world-puzzle that he was so desperate to understand, that he was torturing himself trying to understand was really the puzzle of himself and the world at once, that they were in effect one and the same thing, which was the conclusion he had so far reached, and he had not yet given up on it, when, after a couple of days, he noticed that there was something the matter with his head.

By this time he had lived alone for years, he explained to the seven children, he too squatting and leaning against the barrier in the sharp November wind on the footbridge, alone because his marriage had been wrecked by the Hermes business (he gestured with his hand as if to say he would explain about it later), after which he had "badly burned his fingers with a deeply passionate love affair" and decided: never, never again, would he even so much as get close to a woman, which did not mean, of course, that he led an entirely solitary life, because, as Korin elaborated, gazing at the children, there was the occasional woman on the occasional difficult night, but essentially he was alone, though there remained the various people he came into contact with in the course of his work at the records office, as well as the neighbors with whom he had to maintain neighborly relations, the commuters he bumped into while commuting, the shoppers he met while shopping, the barflies he'd see in the bar and so forth, so that, after all, now he looked back at it, he was in regular contact with quite a lot of people, even if only on the most tenuous of terms, occupying the furthermost corner of the community, at least until they too started to melt away which probably dated from the time that he was feeling increasingly compelled to regale those he met at the records office, on the staircase at home, in the street, at the store and in the bar, with the regrettable news that he believed he was about to lose his head, because, once they understood that the loss was neither figurative nor symbolic but a genuine deprivation in the full physical sense of the word, that, to put it plainly, his head, alas, would actually be severed from his neck, they eventually fled from him as they might flee from a burning house, fleeing in their droves, and very soon every one of them had gone and he stood alone, very much like a burning house in fact: at first it being just the matter of a few people behaving in a more distant fashion, then his colleagues at the records offices ignoring him, not even returning his greeting, refusing to sit at the same table and finally crossing the street when they saw him, then people actually avoiding him in the street, and can you imagine, Korin asked the seven children, how painful this was? how it hurt me most, more than anything, he added, especially with what was happening to the vertebrae in his neck, and this was just when he most needed their support, he said, and while it was plain to see that he would have been pleased to explore this matter in the most intricate detail, it was equally obvious that it would have been wasted on the seven children because they would not have been able to respond in any way, being bored of the subject, particularly at the point when "the geezer started going on about losing his head" which meant "sod all" to them, as later they would tell their friends, and looked at one another while the oldest nodded in agreement with his younger companions as if to say, "forget it, it's not worth it", after which they simply continued squatting, watching the confluence of rails as the occasional goods wagon rattled by below them, though one did ask how much longer they were going to stay there as it was all the same to him, and the blond kid next to the senior one consulted his watch and replied merely that he'd tell them when it was time, and until then he should shut the fuck up.

7.
Had Korin known that they had already arrived at a decision, and specifically at this particular decision; had he in fact noted the meaningful gesture, nothing would have turned out as it did, but, since he hadn't noted it, he wasn't to know and, as a result, his perception of reality was incorrect; for to him it seemed that his current predicament - squatting on the ground with these children in the cold wind - was increasingly fraught with anxiety precisely because nothing was happening, and because it wasn't made clear to him what they wanted, if indeed they wanted anything at all, and since there was no explanation forthcoming as to why they were refusing to let him go or just leave him there, having succeeded in convincing them that the whole thing was pointless because he really had no money, he still felt that there should have been an explanation, and indeed had found one, albeit the wrong one as far as the seven children were concerned, he being aware of exactly how much money was sewn into the lining on the right side of his coat, so their immobility, their numbness, their failure to do anything, in fact the utter lack of any animation whatsoever on their part, took on an ever greater, ever more terrifying significance, though if he had looked at it another way he might have found it progressively more reassuring and less significant; which meant that he spent the first half of each moment preparing to spring to his feet and make a dash for it and the second half remaining precisely where he was, apparently content to stay there and to keep talking, as if he had only just begun his story; in other words, he was equally disposed to escape or remain, though every time he had to make a decision he chose, in fact, to remain, chiefly because he was scared of course, having constantly to assure them how happy he was to have found such sympathetic listeners and how good it all felt, because he had so much, it was extraordinary quite how much, to tell them, really and truly, because when you took time to think about it, 'extraordinary' was absolutely the right word to describe the complex details of his story which, he said, he should tell so it would be clear to them, so they should know how it was that Wednesday, at what precise time he could not remember but it was probably some thirty or forty hours ago, when the fateful day arrived and he realized that he really did have to embark on his "great journey", at which point he understood that everything, from Hermes down to his solitary condition, was driving him in one direction, that he must already have started on the journey because it was all prepared and everything else had collapsed, which is to say that everything ahead of him had been prepared and everything behind him had collapsed, as tended to be the way with all such "great journeys", said Korin.

8.
The only lamps burning were those at the top of the stairs and the light they gave out fell in dingy cones that shuddered in the intermittent gusts of wind that assailed them because the other neon lights positioned in the thirty or so meters between them had all been broken, leaving them squatting in darkness, yet as aware of each other, of their precise positions, as of the enormous mass of dark sky above the smashed neon, the sky which might have glimpsed the reflection of its own enormous dark mass as it trembled with stars in the vista of railway yards spreading below it, had there been some relationship between the trembling stars and the twinkling dull red semaphore of lights sprinkled among the rails, but there wasn't, there was no common denominator, no interdependence between them, the only order and relationship existing within the discrete worlds of above and below, and indeed of anywhere, for the field of stars and the forest of signals stared as blankly at each other as does each and every form of being, blind in darkness and blind in radiance, as blind on earth as it is in heaven, if only so that a long moribund symmetry among this vastness might appear in the lost glance of some higher being, at the center of which, naturally, there would be a miniscule blind-spot: as with Korin. the footbridge. the seven kids.

9. 
A total dickhead, they told a local acquaintance the next day, a total dickhead in a league of his own, a twat they really should have got rid of because you never knew when he'd grass on you, cause he'd had a good look at everybody's face, they added to each other, and could have made a mental note of their clothes, their shoes and everything else they were wearing that late afternoon, so, yeh, that's right, they admitted the next day, they should have got rid of him, only it didn't occur to any of them at the time to do so, everyone being so relaxed and all, so laid back, like a bunch of dopes on the footbridge while ordinary people carried on leading ordinary lives beneath them as they gazed at the darkening neighborhood above the converging rails and waited for the signals for the six-forty-eight in the distance so that they might rush down to the cuttings, taking up their positions behind the bushes in preparation for the usual ritual,  but, as they remarked, none of them had imagined that the ritual might have ended in some other fashion, with a different outcome, that it might be completed entirely successfully, triumphantly, smack on target, in other words with a death, in which case of course even a pathetic git like him would be an obvious danger because he might grass, they said, might get into a funk and, quite unexpectedly,  grass on them to the cops, and the reason it worked out differently, as it did in fact, leaving them to think the thoughts they had just thought, was that they hadn't been concentrating, and can't have been, otherwise they'd have realized that this was precisely the kind of man who presented no danger because, later, he couldn't even remember what, if anything, had happened at about six forty-eight, as he had fallen ever deeper under the spell of his own fear, the fear that drove his narrative onwards, a narrative that, there was no denying, apart from a certain rhythm, lacked all sense of shape or indeed anything that might have drawn attention to his own person, except perhaps its copiousness, which was the result of him trying to tell them everything at once, in the way he himself experienced what had happened to him in a kind of  simultaneity that he first noticed added up to a coherent whole that certain Wednesday morning some thirty or forty hours before, two-hundred-and-twenty kilometers from here in a travel agent's, at the point when he arrived at the front of the queue and was about to ask the time of the next train for Budapest and the cost of the ticket, when, standing at the counter, he suddenly felt that he should not ask that question here, at the same moment recognizing in the reflection in the glass over one of the posters over the counter, two employees of the District Psychiatric Unit, disguised as a pair of ordinary numbskulls, really, two of them, and behind him, at the entrance, a so-called nurse whose aggressive presence made his skin prickle and break into a sweat.

10.
The men from the District Psychiatric Unit, said Korin, never explained to him what he had wanted to know, which was the reason he had attended the unit to start with, and that was the matter of how the whole system that held the skull in place, from the first cervical vertebra through to the ligaments (the rectus capitis), actually functioned, but they never explained it, because they couldn't, chiefly because they themselves had not an inkling, their minds being shrouded in a wholly impenetrable darkness that resulted in them first staring at him in astonishment, as if to indicate that the question itself, the mere asking of it, was so ludicrous that it provided direct and incontrovertible proof of his, Korin's, madness, then giving each other significant glances and little nods whose portent was (was it not?) perfectly clear, that they had dismissed the subject, as a consequence of which he made no further enquiries regarding the matter but, even while steadfastly bearing the enormous weight of the problem, literally, on his shoulders, tried to solve the problem himself by asking what that certain first cervical vertebra and the rectus capitis actually were, how (sighed Korin) they performed their crucial functions and how it was that his skull was simply propped on the topmost vertebra of his spinal column, though when he thought about it at the time, or so he told them now, the idea of his skull being fixed to his spine by cerebro-spinal ligaments, which were the only things holding the lot together, was enough to send shivers down him when he thought of it, and still did send shivers down him, since even a brief examination of his own skull demonstrated the patent truth that this arrangement was so sensitive, so brittle, so vulnerable, in fact one of the most frail and delicate physical structures imaginable, that he concluded it must have been here, at this particular juncture, that his problems had begun and would end, for if the doctors were incapable of coming to any worthwhile conclusion after looking at his x-rays, and things had turned out as they had done so far, then, having steeped himself to some degree at least in the study of  medicine, and having conducted an endless self-examination based on this study, he had no hesitation in declaring  that the pain he was in had its root cause here, in that arrangement of tissue and bone, where vertebra met ligament, and that all attention should be focused on this point, on the ligaments, on which precise point he was not yet certain though he was certain enough about the sensation that spread through his neck and back, week by week, month by month, constantly increasing in intensity, knowing that the process had started and was proceeding irresistibly, and that this whole affair, if one considered it objectively, he said, was bound to lead to the terminal decay of the union of skull and spine, culminating in a condition, not to beat about the bush, for why should one, said Korin pointing to his neck, whereby this frail piece of skin finally gave out when he would inevitably lose his head.

11.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine sets of rails could be distinguished from the vantage point of the footbridge, and the seven of them could do little but count them over and over again, concentrating their attention on the confluence of rails in the perceptibly deepening darkness that was accentuated by the red lights of the signals while waiting for the six forty-eight to appear at last in the distance, for the tension that had suddenly appeared on everyone's hitherto relaxed countenance was occasioned by nothing more at this stage than the impending arrival of the six forty-eight, the mark they had set out to mug having failed, after their first couple of attempts, to provide sufficient entertainment in the short period of their waiting, so that within fifteen minutes of having cornered him, even if they had wanted to, they would have remained incapable of listening to a single word more of the seamless and endless monologue that, even now, cornered as he was, flowed unstoppably from him, because he kept on and on regardless, as they explained the next day, and it would have been unbearable had they not ignored him, because, they added, if they had continued to pay attention to him they would have had to do him in if only to preserve their own sanity, and they had, unfortunately, ignored him for the sake of their sanity, even though this resulted in them missing the chance of  eliminating him, for they really should have eliminated him good and proper, or so they kept repeating to themselves, particularly since the seven of them would normally have been perfectly aware what failing to do eliminate a witness might cost them, a witness like him, who would never completely vanish in the crowd, not to mention the fact that they had begun to get a reputation in certain important places as 'cut-throats', a reputation they had to protect, and killing him would not have been difficult, nor indeed a new proposition to them, and this way they would have been taking no chances.

12.
What had happened to him - Korin shook his head as if he still could not believe it - was, at the beginning, almost inconceivable, nigh unbearable, because even at first glance, following an initial survey of the complex nature of what was involved, one straight look told him that from now on he'd have to abandon his "sick hierarchical view of the world", explode "the illusion of an orderly pyramid of facts" and liberate himself from the extraordinarily powerful and secure belief in what was now revealed as merely a kind of childish mirage, which is to say the indivisible unity and contiguity of phenomena, and beyond that, the unity's secure permanence and stability; and, within this permanence and stability, the overall coherence of its mechanism, that strictly-governed interdependence of  functioning parts which gave the whole system its sense of direction, development, pace and progress, in other words whatever suggested that the thing it embodied was attractive and self-sufficient, or, to put it another way, he now had to say No, an immediate and once-and-for-all No, to that entire mode of life; but some hundred yards on he was forced to reconsider certain aspects of what he had originally termed his rejection of the hierarchical mode of thinking because it seemed to him that he had lost nothing by rejecting a particular order of things that he had elevated into a pyramid structure, a structure that self-evidently needed correcting or rejecting in perpetuity as misleading or inappropriate, no, strange to say, he had lost nothing by the rejection, for what had actually happened that certain night of his birthday, could not be accounted loss as such but rather gain, or at least as a first point gained, an advance in the direction of some all-but-inconceivable, all-but-unbearable end -and in the gradual process of walking the hundred paces from the river to the point where the struggle had begun, and having been granted a glimpse of the terrible complexity ahead, he saw that while the world appeared not to exist, the totality of that-which-had-been-thought-about-it did in fact exist, and, furthermore, that it was only this, in its countless thousands of varieties, that did exist as such, that what existed was his identity as the sum of the countless thousand imaginings of the human spirit that was engaged in writing the world, in writing his identity, he said, in terms of pure word, the doing word, the Verb that brooded over the waters, or, to put it another way, he added,  what became clear was that most opinions were a waste of time, that it was a waste thinking that life was a matter of appropriate conditions and appropriate answers, because the task was not to choose but to accept, there being no obligation to choose between what was appropriate and what was inappropriate, only to accept that we are not obliged to do anything except to comprehend that the appropriateness of the one great universal process of thinking is not predicated on it being correct, for there was nothing to compare it with, nothing but its own beauty, and it was its beauty that gave us confidence in its truth - and this, said Korin, was what struck him as he walked those hundred furiously-thinking paces on the evening of his birthday: that is to say he understood the infinite significance of faith and was given a new insight into what the ancients had long known, that it was faith in its existence that had both created and maintained the world; the corollary of which was that it was the loss of his own faith that was now erasing it, the result of which realization being, he said, that he experienced a sudden, utterly numbing, quite awful feeling of abundance, because from that time on he knew that whatever had once existed, existed still and that, quite unexpectedly, he had stumbled on an ontological place of such gravity that he could see - oh but how, he sighed, how to begin - that Zeus, for instance, to take an arbitrary example, was still 'there', now, in the present, just as all the other old gods of Olympus were 'there', as was Yahweh and The Lord God of Hosts, and there alongside them, the ghosts of every nook and cranny, and that this meant they had nothing and yet everything to fear, for nothing ever disappeared without trace, for the absent had a structure as real as the structure of whatever existed, and so, in other words, you could bump into Allah, into the Prince of the Rebel Angels, and into all the dead stars of the universe, which would of course include the barren unpopulated earth with its godless laws of being as well as the terrifying reality of hell and pandemonium which was the domain of the demons, and that was reality, said Korin: thousands upon thousands of worlds, each one different, majestic or fearsome; thousands upon thousands in their ranks, he continued, his voice rising, in a single absent relationship, that was how it all appeared to him then, he explained, and it was then, when he had got so far, continually reliving the infinite capacity of the process of becoming, that the trouble with his head first started, the predictable course of which process he had already outlined, and possibly it was the sheer abundance, the peculiar inexhaustibility of history and the gods that he found hard to bear, for ultimately he didn't know, nor to this very day was it clear to him, precisely how the pain that started suddenly and simultaneously in his neck and his back, began: the forgetting, subject by subject, random, ungovernable and extraordinarily rapid, first of facts such as where he had put the key that he had only just now been holding in his hand, or what page he had got to in the book he had been reading the previous night, and, later, what had happened on Wednesday, three days ago, in the time between morning and evening, and after that, whatever was important, urgent, dull or insignificant, and finally, even his mother's name, he said, the scent of apricots, whatever made familiar faces familiar, whether he had in fact completed tasks he had set himself to complete - in a word, he said, there was literally nothing that stayed in his head, the whole world had vanished, step by step, the disappearance itself having neither rhyme nor reason in its progress, as if what there was left was somehow sufficient, or as if there were always something of greater importance that a higher, incomprehensible force had decided he should forget.

13.
I must somehow have drunk of the waters of Lethe, Korin explained, and while disconsolately wagging his head as if to convey to them that the understanding of the manner and consequence of events would probably always lie beyond him, he brought out a box of Marlboros: Anyone got a light?

14.
They were roughly the same age, the youngest being eleven, the oldest perhaps thirteen or fourteen, but every one of them had at least one slip-cased razor-blade nestling by his side, nor was it just a matter of nestling there, for each of them, from the youngest to the oldest, was capable of handling it expertly, whether it was of the simple 'singleton' kind or the triple sort they referred to as 'the set', and not one of them lacked the ability to yank the thing forth in the blinking of an eyelid and slip it between two fingers into the tense palm without the merest flickering of outward emotion while gazing steadily at the victim so that whichever of them happened to be in the right position could, quick as a flash, find the artery on the neck, this being the skill they had most perfectly mastered, a skill which rendered them, when all seven of them were together, so exceptionally dangerous that they had begun to earn a genuinely well-deserved reputation, only through constant practice, of course, the practice that enabled them to achieve their current level of performance and involved a carefully planned course of training that they carried through at constantly changing venues, repeating the same moves a hundred times, over and over again, until they could execute the moves with inimitable, blinding speed and such perfect co-ordination that in the course of an attack, they knew instinctively, without saying a word to each other,  not only who would advance and who would stand, but how those standing would form up, nor was there any room for boasting, you couldn't even think of it, so faultless was their teamwork, and in any case, the sight of gushing blood was enough to stop their mouths and render them dumb, disciplined and solemn, perhaps even too solemn, for the solemnity was something of a burden to them, leaving them with a desire for some course of action that would lead rather more playfully, more fortuitously, that is to say entailing a greater risk of failure, to the fact of death, since this was what they all sought, this was the way things had developed, this was what interested them, in fact it was the reason they had gathered here in the first place, the reason they had already spent a good many afternoons, so many weeks of afternoons and early evenings, passing the time right here.

15.
There was absolutely nothing ambiguous about the way he moved, said Korin next day in the MALEV tourist office, the whole thing being so completely normal, so ordinary, the reaching for his cigarettes so perfectly innocent and harmless that it was merely a kind of instinct, the result of an on-the-spur-of-the-moment notion that he might lessen the tension and thereby ease his own situation by a friendly gesture such as the offering of cigarettes, for really, no exaggeration, it was just that and nothing more, and while he expected almost anything to happen as a result, what he did not expect was to find another hand holding his wrist by the time his had reached the Marlboros in his pocket, a hand that did not grip the way a pair of handcuffs would, but one that rendered him immobile and sent a flood of warmth lapping across his wrist, or so he explained the next day, still in a state of shock, while at the same time, he continued, he felt his muscles weaken, only those muscles that were grasping the pack of Marlboros, and all this happened without a word being exchanged and, what was more - apart from the child nearest to him, who had responded so nimbly and with such breath-taking skill to the gesture he had misinterpreted - the group did not move an inch, but merely glanced at the falling Marlboro packet, until one of them eventually lifted it up, opened it and drew out a cigarette, passed it on to the next, and so forth to the end while he, Korin, in his terror, behaved as though nothing had happened, nothing significant at least, or, if anything had happened it was only by accident so minor and so unworthy of mention as to be laughable, an accident that left him gripping his wounded wrist with his blameless hand, not quite understanding what had happened, and even when he did eventually realize, he merely pressed his thumb against the tiny nick, for that was all it was, he told them, a miniscule cut, and when the expected rush of panic, with its attendant throbbing, trembling, and loud noises in the head began to die away, an icy calm had lapped about him in much the same way as the blood had lapped about his wrist, in other words, as he declared the next day, he was utterly convinced that they were going to kill him.

16
The work in the records office, he continued in a quavering voice, having waited for the last of the children to light his cigarette, did not involve, as did that of so many others, at least as far as he personally was concerned, a process of humiliation, blackmail, of wearing people down; no, not in his case, he stressed: on the contrary, he was bound to say, that after 'the sad turn of events in his social life', it was precisely his work that remained most important to him, that was his sole consolation both in the obligatory and voluntary after-hours areas of his specialization; it was the one thing, in the fundamental and, as far as he was concerned, fateful, process of the last few months of coming to terms with a reality which involved acknowledging the not-so-much bitter as amusing evidence that showed history and truth had nothing to do with each other, that demonstrated to him that everything he, in his capacity as a local historian, had done to explore, establish, maintain and nurture as history, had in fact given him an extraordinary freedom and raised him to a state of grace; because once he was capable of considering how any particular history served as a peculiar - if one regarded its origins, accidental, and if one considered its outcomes, cynically concocted and artificially articulated - blend of some remaining elements of the truth, of human understanding and the  imaginative re-creation of the past, of what could and could not be known, of confusion, of lies, of exaggerations, of both fidelity to- and  misuse of- given data, of both proper and improper interpretations of evidence, of inklings, suggestions and of the marshalling of a sufficiently imposing body of opinion, then the work in the records office, the labor of, what was referred to as, the classifying and ordering of archive material and indeed all such enterprises, represented nothing less than  freedom itself, for it did not matter in the least what task he was currently engaged on, whether the classification was within general, median or specific categories, whether it was filed under this or that heading; whatever he did, whichever section of that almost two-thousand-meters' length of archival corridor he dealt with, he was simply keeping history going, if he might put it that way,  while knowing, at the same time, that he was entirely missing the truth, though the fact that he knew, even while he was working, that he was missing it, rendered him calm and equable gave him a certain sense of invulnerability, the kind that comes to a man who recognizes that what he is doing is as pointless as it is meaningless, and furthermore that, precisely because it lacks point and meaning, it is accompanied by an entirely mysterious yet quite inimitable sweetness - yes, that was the way it was, he said, he really did find freedom through work, and there was just one problem, which was that this freedom wasn't quite enough, for, having tasted it these last few months and having realized how rare and precious it was, it suddenly seemed insufficient, and he had started to sigh and pine for a greater, an absolute freedom, and thought only of how and where he might find it, until the whole issue became a burning obsession that disturbed him in his work in the records office, because he had to know where to seek it, where absolute freedom might reside.

All this, of course, indeed his whole history, originated in the distant past, said Korin, as far back as the time he first announced the fact that though an utterly mad world had made a madman of him, pure and simple, it didn't mean that that is entirely what he was, for while it would have been stupid to deny that sooner or later, naturally enough, that was how he'd "finish up", or rather, sooner or later, reach a state resembling madness, it was obvious that whatever might in fact happen, madness was not a particularly unfortunate condition that one should fear as being oppressive or threatening, a condition one should be frightened of, no, not in the least, or at least he personally was not scared of it, not for a moment, for it was simply a matter of fact, as he later explained to the seven children, that one day the straw actually did "break the camel's back", for now that he recalled it, the story did not begin beside that certain river but much earlier, well before the riverside events, when he was suddenly seized by a hitherto unknown and unfathomably deep bitterness that resonated through his entire being, a bitterness so sudden that one particular day it simply struck him how bitter, how deathly bitter he was about that which he used to refer to as "the state of things", and that this was not the result of some mood that quickly appeared then disappeared but of an insight that illuminated him like a bolt of lightning, something, he said, that branded him for ever and would remain burning, a lightning-insight that said there was nothing, but nothing worthwhile left in the world, not that he wanted to exaggerate, but that was how it was, there really was nothing worthwhile in his circumstances, nor would there be anything lovely or good ever again, and though this sounded childish, and indeed he recognized that the essential element of that which he had distilled from his entire history, was,  as he was content to acknowledge, childish, he began to peddle this insight regularly in bars, hoping to find someone that, in his "general state of despair", he might regard as one of those "angels of mercy", seeking such a one constantly, determined to tell him everything or to put a pistol to his own head, as he did, he said, without success, thank heaven; so, in other words, though the whole thing was perfectly idiotic, no doubt, that  was how it started, with this sense of bitterness that created a whole "new Korin", from which point on he began to ponder over matters such as how things fitted together, and if their condition were such and such what the implications might be for him personally, and once having understood that there were absolutely no personal implications, and furthermore, having grasped that he had reached his absolute limit, he then decided that he would resign himself to it, to say OK, fine, that's how things are, but then, if that was the case, what should he do, give up? disappear? or what? and it was precisely this question, or rather the fact that he approached this question in such a 'so-what's-the-point-of-it-all' manner, that led directly to the fateful day, meaning that certain Wednesday morning when he concluded that there was nothing for it but to take immediate action, this being the direct conclusion he had reached, albeit by a dauntingly difficult route, and the seven of them here were witnesses, he said, still squatting in the middle of the footbridge, to the daunting difficulty  of it, right from the time by the river when he first understood the complexity of the world, then by developing an ever deepening comprehension which in someone like him, a local historian of some god-forsaken place, involved getting to grips with the inordinate wealth and complexity of possible thought about a world that didn't exist, as well as with the strength to be derived from the creative power of blind faith, and all this while forgetfulness and the constant terror of losing his head crept up on him, so that the taste of freedom he had enjoyed in the records office might carry him through to the end of his quest, after which there would be nowhere left to go and he would have to decide, and indeed declare, that he himself would no longer allow matters to proceed as they might have wanted to proceed, but mount the stage 'as an actor', not as others around him tended to do, did but quite differently, by, for instance, after one enormous effort of thinking, simply leaving, yes, leaving, abandoning the place allotted to him in life, leaving it for ever, not simply in order to be in an indeterminate elsewhere, but, or so the idea came to him, to locate the very center of the world, the place where matters were actually decided, where things happened, a place such as Rome had been, ancient Rome where decisions had been made and events set in motion, to find that place and then quit everything; in other words he decided to pack up his things and seek such a 'Rome'; for why, he asked himself, why spend his time in an archive some two-hundred kilometers south-west of Budapest when he could be sitting at the center of the world, since one way or the other, it would be his last stop on earth? and the idea having come to him it began to crystallize in his constantly aching head and he had even begun to study foreign languages, when, one late afternoon, having stayed behind in the records office, vaguely checking the shelves, as he put it, utterly by chance, he arrived at a shelf he had never before explored, took down from it a box that had never been taken down, not at least since the Second World War, that was for sure, and from this box labeled  'Family Papers of no Particular Significance' took out a fascicule headed IV.3 / 1941-42, opened it and, in doing so, changed his life for ever, for there he discovered something that decided for once and for all what he should do if he still wanted to 'carry his plan through' and to make 'his last goodbyes'; something that finally determined him to put all those years of thinking, proposing and doubting behind him, to let those years go, to let them rot in the past, and not to let them determine his future but to act  right now, for the fascicule headed IV.3 / 1941-2 had left him in no doubt what should be done, what to do in order to recover the dignity and meaning whose loss he had been mourning,, what important thing there remained for him to do, and above all, where he should seek that which he so much lacked: that peculiar, furiously desired, greatest, very last freedom that earthly life was capable of offering.

The only things that interested them, they said the next day while hanging about in front of the Bingo Bar, were the feeding-catapults, the kind used by anglers for bait, not the mind-numbingly idiotic claptrap the geezer spewed continuously, without any prospect of an end, for he was incapable of stopping, so that eventually, after an hour or so of it, it became clear that it was his own repulsive gabble that had turned him into a head-case, though as far as they were concerned, they said, it didn't add up to anything, so it was completely pointless for him to talk himself into a frazzle, since the geezer meant as much to them as the wind on the footbridge, wind, that, like him, just kept blowing because it was impossible to shut either of them up, not that they gave it a thought, why would they? since he was not worth it, let him talk wind, the only things that mattered being the three feeding-catapults, how they worked and how they would employ them when the six-forty-eight arrived, and that was what they'd all been thinking about just before this creep arrived, of the three professional model ground-baiting catapults they had got as a bargain, for nine-thousand Forints, at the Attila József flea market, the three professional German ground-baiting catapults they had tucked under their bomber jackets, and they wondered how these would perform, for people said their projectile power was vastly greater than that of the Hungarian sort, and, of course, far superior to that of hand-held missiles, some people even claiming that this German gear was not only more powerful but almost ensured that your aim was one hundred-percent effective, and that it was, according to its reputation, no argument about it, the best on the market, chiefly because of the track-device, attached to the handle below the fork, that steadied your hand in case it accidentally trembled, thereby reducing the uncertainty factor to a minimum by holding the arm firm all the way to the elbow, or so it was said, they declared, or so they say, but not in their wildest dreams would they have imagined what really happened after that, since this piece of goods was brilliant, its capacity absolutely phenomenal, they said, or so said the four of them who were not among the first to use it, absolutely phenomenal, they said.

19.
Another long goods train rumbled by below them and the footbridge shook gently along its whole length until the train was gone - leaving two blinking red lights in its wake - when the noise of the very last wagon began to fade along with the rattling of wheels, and, in the newly settled silence, after the two red lights disappearing in the distance, just above the rails, no more than a meter high, a flock of bats appeared and followed the train towards the Rákosrendezö, utterly silent, without the least sound, like some medieval battery of ghosts, in close order, at even pace, indeed at a mysteriously even pace, swooping strictly between the parallel lines of the rails, suggesting somehow that they were being drawn towards Budapest or riding in the slipstream of the train as it went, the train that was showing them the way, carrying them, drawing them, sucking them on so that they could travel perfectly effortlessly, with steady, spread wings, reaching Budapest, at a precise height of one meter above the sleepers.

20.
Funnily enough he didn't smoke, said Korin, and he only happened to possess this pack of Marlboros because somewhere on his journey he had to get some change for the coffee machine and the man in the tobacconists he wandered into, would only oblige if he bought a pack of cigarettes, so, what could he do but buy one, but he didn't throw if away because he thought it might come in useful some time, and would you believe it, he added,  he was so pleased that it had actually come in useful, even if he himself had no use for it, or rather, only on one occasion, said Korin raising his index finger, for he had to be honest about it, there was one single moment, and only one, when he would happily have lit a cigarette, which was the time when he returned from the IBUSZ bus company's ticket office without having accomplished his mission, all because of the two male nurses from the Psychiatric Unit; for he was aware of their eyes following him as he walked away, then as they looked at each other, not in any significant way, or at least not yet, not yet in a way that might show they were resolved to act, though soon enough they did start off after him, a fact of which he was absolutely certain without having to look back over his shoulder, for every cell in his body knew they were close behind him, after which, said Korin, he went home, straight home without a thought, and started packing, and though the apartment was already sold, and many of his possessions already cheaply disposed of, a disposal that involved the wholesale liquidation of a terrifying pile of accumulated notes, scraps, diaries, exercise books, photocopies and letters, not to mention photographs, and, apart from his passport, all his official documents including his birth-certificate, his TB card, his personal ID etc, the lot tossed on the fire, and yet, having survived the entire process and come through feeling that no earthly possession remained to burden him, the moment he stepped into his room he experienced a sense of utter despair, because now that he was ready to leave immediately, the very copiousness of his preparations for leaving appeared to be an obstacle: he was incapable of resolving himself to simply go, even though the feeling of long preparation, he said, was misleading because there had not really been 'copious preparations' as such, since one generous hour was all that had been needed for him to free himself of his material possessions and make ready to go, and please imagine, he continued, raising his voice, imagine that one bare hour was enough after all those months of forethought to set out, there and then, on his long journey, to open the door and leave the apartment to which he would never return, a single hour for his plans to be carried out and become reality, to leave everything for ever, but then, just when he was as ready for departure as he could ever be, there he was, stuck, standing plumb in the middle of the cleared apartment, looking around, and without any sense of regret or emotion casting his eyes over the vacancy when he suddenly understood that one hour was enough for any of us to dispose of everything, to stand plumb in the middle of our forsaken apartment and step out into the melancholy womb of the world, said Korin, and well, at that point, he would happily have flicked a lighter and smoked a decent cigarette, which was strange, but all of a sudden he desired the taste of cigarettes and wanted to draw heavily on one, to take a good deep breath, blow out the smoke, nice and slowly, and though this was the only occasion on which he felt like this, and had never desired a cigarette before nor since, not once, never in his life would he understand what it was all about.

21.
For an archivist, said Korin, and especially for a head archivist-in-waiting such as him, there were a great many fields to master, but he can tell them one thing, that no archivist, not even a head-archivist-in-waiting, such as, in fact, he was in all but name, was in possession of essential information regarding the practicalities of travel on the buffers- or guards'-vans of freight trains, and that was why, when in deciding that the nature of his permanently fugitive status was such that he couldn't trust to buses, passenger trains, or even to the exigencies of hitch-hiking, for a person committed to "any route that was fixed and might be inspected at any point" was vulnerable to discovery, identification, and easy arrest, he had set out on this veritably terrifying Calvary, and just imagine what it was like, said Korin, for someone who, as they already knew, had been used to restricting his movements to the four fixed points of his personal compass, to wit his flat, the pub, the archive and, let us say, the nearest shop, and had never - he wasn't exaggerating - really never, not even for an hour, ventured beyond them and now suddenly found himself off limits, in the deserted, wholly unfamiliar back end of some railway yard, stumbling over tracks, balancing on sleepers, keeping an eye on signals and points, ready to dive into a ditch or behind a bush at the first sight of a train or a rail yard employee, for that's how it was, rails, sleepers, signals, points, being constantly prepared to throw himself on the ground, and, right from the start, to leap on or off a moving wagon, while being in a permanent state of anxiety that extended over the whole hundred and twenty kilometers of the journey, anxiety in case he was spotted by a night-watchman, a stationmaster or someone checking the brakes or axles, a terrible experience on the whole, he said, even having got so far, knowing how much was behind him; bad even to think of having undertaken such a journey, for he couldn't say what was the most exhausting, most embittering part of it, the cold that ate into your bones in the brake-van or the fact that he had no idea where he could or dared to sleep, for the space was so narrow that he had no room to stretch his legs and consequently had constantly to be standing up and lying down then standing up again, a process which naturally drained him, not to mention the other privations, for example having nothing but biscuits, chocolates or coffee at railway cafes for sustenance after two days of which he was permanently nauseous, and so you see, he told the seven children, the whole thing, believe me, was shit-awful, not only the cold and lack of sleep, not just the stiff leg or the nausea, no, for even when they had eased off somewhat and everything was generally fine there remained the perpetual anxiety every time the train departed for whatever perfectly appropriate destination was announced on the boards of the engine, that by the time they passed through it, leaving the town or village behind, be that place Békéscsaba. Mezoberény, Gyoma or Szajol, he immediately lost confidence and that uncertainty grew in him mile by mile so that pretty soon he was on the point of leaping off and boarding a train in the opposite direction, though he hadn't ever actually done that, for, he said, for he would invariably decide that there was more choice at a major stop, and then would immediately regret his decision not to leap when there was still time but to stay on, at which point he would feel utterly lost and have to remain on full alert in case the journey took him into still more dangerous territory where anyone might come along - railway workers, night-watchmen, engine-drivers, or whoever - for that would really be the end of everything, and then he would have to leap from the van into any cover that might be on offer, whether that was a ditch, a building or some shrubbery and that was precisely how he come to be here, said Korin, how he arrived, frozen through, desperate for food, for something salty preferably, or actually not too salty, but in any case, if they didn't mind, he would happily move on now and get into the city center for he urgently needed to find some shelter for the night until the MALEV airline ticket-office opened the next morning.

22.
It was remarkable that the chosen pebble, which was about the size of a child's fist, had succeeded at the first attempt in shattering one of the windows, so that they could not only hear it over the clattering of the train but see it too, as one of the many speeding panes of glass broke in a fraction of a second into a thousand tiny splinters and shards, for the train had arrived, as they explained the next day, a few minutes late, they said, but they attacked it as soon as it appeared, rushing down the embankment to the prearranged cover, and as soon as the train hove into sight they leapt into action, firing, three of them with feeding-catapults, three with regular catapults, one with only his bare hands, but all co-ordinated in attack formation, firing, peppering the six-forty eight, so that a window in the first carriage was immediately blown to pieces, not that they were satisfied with that alone but launched a second wave of attacks and had only to watch out for the possible shriek of the emergency brakes, though that was something they had to devote intense attention to in order to make an on-the-spot assessment as to whether the brakes had been applied or not, and no, they hadn't, because there was not a squeal that might signal its possible application, for there was probably overwhelming panic up there by the window where people had been sitting and the whole thing, difficult as it was to figure, they said as they gave a detailed account of the affair in front of the Bingo Bar, was the work of less than a minute, no more perhaps than twenty seconds, or maybe even less, they added, since it's really tough to be precise about it, though one thing was certain, which was that they were, all of them, on full alert, as they had to be, listening out for the possible application of the emergency brake, but since there was no evidence of that in that certain twenty-seconds or so, they tried a second volley, and they could hear its effect, that it struck the carriages on the side with terrific force, with a loud ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta, to show that one of the last volleys had once more reached its target, that another window had been smashed, for they could hear it as the train roared by at terrific speed, making a terrific racket as the glass shattered, though later, when they sized it all up, that is to say once they had withdrawn to a safe distance and, in their own fashion, with ever greater elation, considered the matter in detail, the general feeling was that the second direct hit must have been on the mail-van, whereas the first, and their voices broke with excitement at this, was a perfect bull's-eye, a word they kept repeating, going round and round in circles like a finger tickling a sensitive spot, repeating the words, passing them on, one to the other, so that by the end they were all choking, gagging, gurgling, helplessly rolling on the ground with lunatic laughter, a laughter that, once it had possessed them, would not let go now, and had gripped them in the past, so they kept exclaiming, bull's-eye! all the while clapping each other on the shoulder and hitting each other, repeating: bull's-eye! fuck it all! what about that then! what do you say to that, you prick! you prick! you prick! bundling and pounding each other, crying, bull's-eye! until they were exhausted, at a safe distance from the scene of the crime, from the surmise that they had actually killed someone, without Korin suspecting any of this of course, for he wasn't even sure what happened to the seven children once they had suddenly leapt up and disappeared from the bridge, disappeared like camphor, as if they had never been there at all, all seven of them, all seven storming off into eternity, at which point he too took off, not glancing back, simply running in the opposite direction, anywhere to be away from the place, with but one thought pounding through his head, to be away, away, as far as possible from here, his chest shaking with the single urge, his one imperative in his great haste not to miss the route into town, for that was the point after all, to reach central Budapest and find some place where he could shelter for the night, warm himself and perhaps get a bite to eat, but, failing that, to find some accommodation, some free accommodation, for he couldn't spare the money not knowing how much the ticket next day would cost him, as he explained at the MALEV office, for all he wanted was some place where he would be left in peace, that was all he desired when, quite unexpectedly, he found his way free again, the children suddenly having disappeared, without explanation, without a word, while he, with his stiff leg, no longer clutching the wound that had stopped bleeding, seized the unhoped for chance of escape, running and running until he could run no more, getting ever closer to the denser lights up ahead, slowing to a walk in his exhaustion, utterly drained by the terror he had just endured, so that he no longer cared what people said to him, and frankly he no longer gave a damn whether he ran into his pursuers or not, but stared directly in the eyes of those going the opposite way, confronting them in mid-gaze, seeking the one man that he, in his hungry, spent condition, might find it worth his while to address.

23
That's the kind of person I am, said Korin, and spread his arms wide, having arrived at a crowded place and spotted a young couple, yet immediately conscious of the impossibility of telling them who he was, and of the general lack of interest likely to be evinced by anyone else in the matter, simply adding: You wouldn't happen to know a place where.. where I might spend the night?

24
The music, the venue, the crowds, or rather, that mass of young faces; the dim light, the volume of noise, the wreaths of rolling smoke; the young couple he had addressed and the way they helped him when he, like them, was being frisked at the cash-desk, the way they led him in and explained where things were while constantly reassuring him that, of course, they could solve his problem, the best solution being to enter and remain in the Almássy, where there was likely to be a real hard-core gig, with  Balaton as the main band featuring Mihály Víg, and he needn't worry because it would be the kind of gig that would go on till dawn; and then it struck him, the extraordinarily dense crowd of people, the stench and, by the end, all those dazed, empty, sad eyes everywhere, in other words what with everything happening so suddenly and all at once, said Korin the next day at the MALÉV office, after those long days of solitude followed by the hour of terror when he was attacked on the railway bridge, he suddenly felt utterly exhausted and had barely spent a minute in there before his head ached and he felt dizzy, unable to adjust to anything, his eyes being accustomed to neither the dim light nor the smoke, his ears, after all the mad panic he had been through, unable to cope with the peculiar, quite unbearable racket, and, heaven knows, at first he was incapable even of movement - as he recounted next day - among this  "crush of desperate pleasure seekers", being hemmed-in, rooted to the spot, then gradually swept one way then the other by close groups of perspiring dancers, eventually fighting his way through to the wall where he managed to insert himself between two silent huddles who happened to be hanging about there; and there, and only there at last could he try to come to terms with the noise-level by adopting some kind of defensive posture against it and against all the misfortunes that had so unexpectedly befallen him, to begin to collect himself and assemble his thoughts, for, having reached this point of security, however infernally crowded and chaotic it was, his capacity for thinking had simply been shot to pieces, shot utterly to pieces, and the more he tried to concentrate the more his thoughts fell apart, so he would have far preferred to abandon the idea of thinking altogether and lie down in a corner, but that was out of the question, though that, on the whole, was his last coherent thought in a long time, the last decision he was capable of making while he continued standing there, gazing first at the band while one thought after another disintegrated before rising to the surface, then at the mass of people, then at the band again, attempting, without success, to catch something of the words of the rapid succession of songs, hearing only the odd phrase, such as "it's all over" and "everything's finished", responding chiefly to the ice-cold melancholy of the music that immediately communicated itself to him despite the sheer volume of noise, and he gazed at the three performers, at the green-haired drummer who stood at the back thrashing his drums while solemnly staring straight ahead, at the blond bass-guitarist beside him lazily rocking his body to the rhythm of the music and the singer, a man of roughly the same age as Korin himself, with his microphone at the front whose severe expression suggested terminal exhaustion and the desire to talk of nothing but terminal exhaustion, who occasionally directed his severe expression at the seething mass below him, as if he would happily have climbed off the stage and disappeared for ever but remained there and continued singing, and, to tell the truth, Korin explained, there was something in this ruthless melancholy that incapacitated him, drugged him, defeated him, that tightened his throat, so that frankly, those first two or three hours of the hard-core gig at the Central club in Almássy tér simply offered him no refuge at all.

25.
Teflon heart, they hummed along in chorus with the singer, but pretty soon the THC appeared and there was no problem, only a few jolly little tours of the place as usual, so that, as they said to a close friend on the telephone the next day, having come in with them and disappeared in the heaving throng, they lost sight of him, though he was a truly weird guy the way he came up to them in the square and told them he was such and such a kind of guy, asked them if they knew anywhere to stay; just imagine, they told the friend, that, literally, that was all he said, that he was such and such a kind of guy, without going into any detail as to just what kind of a guy he was, that was the line he took, no shit, eh? and the clothes he wore! that enormous, long dark-gray overcoat smelling of mothballs, his great lanky body and his comparatively tiny, round, bald head with these two big ears sticking out, so he looked fucking brilliant, they repeated time and again, like some old bat on its hind legs, meaning Korin of course, for who would have failed to recognize himself from such a description, and even though he did not forget them, the young boy and the girl who had brought him in, he did not think there was even the glimmer of a chance of seeing them ever again, not, at least, in this crowd, for after two or three hours, having finally warmed himself through and begun to get used to the atmosphere of the place, he ventured away from the wall to seek some sort of bar, to find a drink, above all, not of course, he added to himself, anything alcoholic, for he had utterly forsworn alcohol a few months ago, and so he launched out into the seething mass to buy himself a Coke, a small one at first, then a larger one, then another large one, not the bottled kind but tins from the machine, which were just as satisfying and, after the third, his stomach being full, his hunger had quite vanished, and the evening having worn on into the small hours, he made it his top priority to explore the possibilities of the environment of the Central in Almássy tér, and soon located some of the possible nooks and crannies where he might see out the rest of the night, somewhere security wouldn't find him even should the hard-core gig finish before dawn; and so he traipsed up and down, climbed stairs, tried a few door handles without anyone paying him the slightest attention for, by this time everyone, every boy and every girl, without exception, was wholly, but truly wholly, lost to the world, and he was confronted by an ever growing sea of glassy eyes, stumbling into ever more bodies on his way, some of them choosing to flop against him like sacks, impossible to stand them upright again, so that by the end there was an extraordinary scene wherein, eventually, the whole of Almássy tér was laid out on the floor or stretched over the stairs or collapsed on the stone paving of the toilets, like the remnants of some peculiar battlefield where defeat is an idea that slowly creeps over the combatants, as if radiating from within them, the singer continuing to sing until, finally, he stopped, not, as it struck Korin, at the end of a song, but somewhere in the middle, abrupt as death, removing his guitar and silently, with, if possible, a look more solemn and severe  than before, leaving the stage somewhere at the back in the wings; and since Korin knew by now precisely where he would go to "spend the night" should it ever begin to wind down, as it did now, the singer having ended the evening in his own strange manner, Korin quickly left the hall, took a door to the left, climbed a few stairs to a room behind the stage where they stored scenery, full of junk, folding screens, miscellaneous items of furniture and sheets of plywood that afforded a good hiding place, and he was in the corridor on his way to precisely that point of refuge when suddenly the singer appeared opposite him, his face ravaged, and cast one sharp glance at him, at Korin that is, said Korin, and the thought occurred to him, he added next day,  that this figure storming past him with long strides, his long hair flowing, was probably Mihály Víg, and was briefly flustered but quickly realized that the singer was not in the least interested in what a stranger was doing there, so Korin too walked on and slipped into the scenery store-room, behind a wardrobe and a screen, found a warm piece of curtain material, lay down on it and wrapped the remainder around himself, made himself at home in other words, and the moment he put his head down he not so much fell asleep as fainted from exhaustion.

26
It was an inexpressibly beautiful, unbelievably tranquil scene he found himself in as he sensed in every cell of his body, sensed it, he explained the next day, rather then saw it, because his eyes were closed, his two arms spread and relaxed, his legs slightly open, comfortable, the lush lawn beneath him softer than any down, light breezes playing about him like delicate hands, and the gentle waves of sunlight as intimate and close as breathing. together with the luxuriant vegetation that enfolded him, the animals drowsing in the distant shade, the azure canvas of sky above him, the earth an aromatic mass below, and this and that other thing, he said, infinite, endlessly flowing in an as-yet-incomplete harmony yet permanent, immobile, echoing his own permanence and immobility, lying there, stretching, fixed as if by nails in his horizontal, immersed, practically submerged position, as if peace were this dish of dizzying sweetness and he the table, as if such peace and such sweetness really existed, as if there were such a place and such tranquility, as if such a thing existed, said Korin, as if it were possible.

He couldn't really claim, he told the stewardess at the MALÉV office the next day, to be one of those to whom courage comes readily and without an effort of the will, someone capable of addressing strangers or using the fact that they were both waiting for something as an excuse, but having her, the stewardess, beside him like this, a stewardess who was so lovely with her smile and those two little dimples, he had found himself, having sat down a few minutes ago, tempted to dart brief glances in her direction, but recognizing that this was a shifty way of behaving, he had abstained and would prefer to come clean now and admit that he did in fact want to look at her, hoping that this disclosure might not prove too offensive or sly and that the young lady would not be angry, regarding it neither as a pass nor as a clumsy attempt to draw her into conversation, for nothing was further from his mind, but the stewardess being not only lovely but beautiful in a way that he couldn't forbear to remark on, he hoped she might not regard it as a proposition, oh no, apologies in advance, certainly not a proposition because he was beyond propositioning anyone, he said, it was merely the beauty, the sheer extraordinary beauty he discerned in the young stewardess lady that so overwhelmed him, as she would understand, wouldn't she? said Korin, for it wasn't a case of him, Korin, wishing to be intrusive, but rather of her beauty inadvertently intruding on him, and while he was at it, he added, elaborating on his theme, let him at least in all humility properly introduce himself, György Korin, though he wouldn't really want to delve into his occupation for anything he might say on that subject would pertain only to his past, though he would have plenty to say, particularly today and particularly to her, about himself some other time in future and only then, though the prospect of doing so was pretty dim, and the most he could do for now was to let her know her why he had eventually plucked up courage to speak to her, which was to tell her what a strange, in fact utterly extraordinary dream he had had last night, though he rarely dreamt, or rather hardly ever remembered his dreams, last night being a unique exception, for he not only dreamt but remembered precisely every last detail of the dream, and she should imagine a place of inexpressible beauty, of unbelievable tranquility that he could sense in every cell of his body for though his eyes were closed he could feel his two arms spread out, relaxed, his legs slightly open, comfortable, and she should imagine, he said, a lush lawn, softer than any down, the light breezes playing about him like delicate hands, and, lastly, imagine the gentle waves of sunlight intimate and close as breathing, the density of the luxuriant vegetation that enfolded him and the animals drowsing in the distant shade, with the azure canvas of the sky above and the aromatic mass of soil below, and so on, this thing and that thing, infinite, endlessly flowing in an as-yet-incomplete harmony yet permanent, immobile, echoing his own permanence and immobility, lying there, stretching, fixed as if by nails in his horizontal, immersed, practically submerged position, as if peace were a dish of dizzying sweetness and he the table, as if such peace and such sweetness really existed, as if there were such a place and such tranquility, as if such a thing existed, if you know what I mean, said Korin, as if it were possible, do you see, young lady? the whole experience being so, you know, convincing, though if there was anyone who might be skeptical of such a dream, it would be the dreamer himself, Korin, though there was nothing in his life that had not been unlikely, right from the start, just think of him, György Korin, living in a small provincial town some two-hundred and twenty kilometers south-east of here, though how to begin, it is so damned difficult, really practically impossible to describe how it all began, but, if he didn't bore her, for he had to wait here in any case, he would try to describe one or two minor incidents in his life if only that she might have some idea who he was, who it was talking to her and addressing her, in fact who was it she was having to put up with for having suddenly been addressed like this, without formalities or introductions.

She had, she felt obliged to respond, been runner-up in a beauty contest, and though nothing could have been further from her mind than involving herself in a conversation with the man who had settled himself beside her, this being of all possible options open to her the last she would choose, as she had more than once tried to convey to him, she nevertheless drifted into communication somehow and found herself answering when she should have kept quiet and even responding, if only with a word or two, when she should have turned her head away, so that she was genuinely unaware that she had become involved with a complete stranger in exactly the conversation she had wished to avoid, explaining to him how dog-tired she was, because to take this moment as an example, she had no idea how long she would have to wait, how utterly unaccustomed she was to waiting like this so that she might meet and have the responsibility of escorting a passenger in a wheelchair, an old Swiss lady, and to do something she had never done before, that is to transport her to the airport and assist her onto the night-flight to Rome; and so, in telling him this, she had entered into an informal conversation with this man despite her best intentions, and whether it happened this way or the other, who cares, she didn't particularly mind in the end, she told the others once they were on board, it was only the beginning that was so weird, for she thought she was dealing with a lunatic or something, the kind who talks to himself, but he wasn't that, he was different, perfectly harmless, with rather nice big ears, and she had always had a weakness for big ears because they made the face look sweet, and in any case she could have stood up and left him any time she wanted, but was happy enough for him to tell her practically his entire life story, because it was simply irresistible, she just had to listen, and cross her heart, she did listen, though, to tell the truth, it was hard to know whether he was telling the truth, for could it really be that someone of such advanced age as forty-something, who knows how old exactly, could sell up and go to New York, not because he wanted to make a new life for himself but because he wanted to end his life there, for nowhere else would do, as the man kept saying, but "the very center of the world", which New York might be for all she knew, anyway he was pretty convincing, she continued in the cabin, it was impossible to think otherwise, though it is natural to be a little skeptical in view of everything one hears nowadays, none of it true, and though this man, of course, did not seem to be the sort of person whose word you'd doubt, far from it, in fact after a while she herself had seriously told him such things as she hadn't told anyone else, for they did have to wait an awfully long time, and she had, in this way, so to speak, opened up to him for he himself was so earnest that she grew quite upset, and somehow she kept feeling that she might be the very last person ever to listen to him, it was really that sad, and he was so fulsome in praise of her beauty that he had asked why she did not enter a beauty-contest since she would be sure, absolutely certain, to win it, in response to which she did at last confess that once, in a moment of weakness, she did in fact enter one but had come away so terribly disillusioned with what she saw that she felt quite embittered by the experience of entering in the first place, and it was so nice when his answer to this was that she should not have been named runner-up, because that was clearly ridiculous and wholly unfair, but should have been awarded first prize.

I need a ticket for the next flight, said Korin at the desk, and when he leaned across it to explain the matter to the clerk who was staring into her computer, making it clear to her that this was no ordinary journey, nor he an ordinary traveler, meaning he was not a tourist, not on a family visit, nor was he a businessman, all she said, after a lot of humming, hawing and shaking of heads, was that she would be grateful if he would stop leaning across her desk, and that his one very faint hope of success lay in a so-called "lahsminih" flight, though he would have to wait for that too in order to discover whether it was in fact worth waiting, and so, if in the meantime, he would be so good as to return to his seat. but Korin begged her pardon, asking what that meant, and she had to enunciate it clearly, syllable by syllable, "lahs-min-ih" while he kept turning it over and over in his mind, aloud, until his English lessons of the last few months kicked in and he realized that what she meant to say was probably "last minute", yes, that was it, now he understood, he said, though he was far from understanding anything until, on his puzzled return to the bench, the stewardess explained it to him, though it transpired that he would also need a "so-called visa", and naturally he didn't have one, at which point the stewardess's beautiful face darkened for a minute, and everyone looked at him repeating, Visa? does he, Korin, mean to say he has no visa? but does he know what this means? does he understand that it can take up to a week to obtain a visa? and how can he present himself at the desk with an on-the-spot request for a ticket? indeed, too bad, the stewardess nodded in melancholy fashion, then, seeing how Korin had sunk back beside her in desperation, advised him that he shouldn't despair and that she would have a go, and, so saying, she stepped across to the nearest telephone and began phoning, ringing first one place then another, though because of all the noise Korin couldn't understand a word she was saying, and after half an hour or so someone appeared announcing that it would be all right, sir, regard the problem as solved, and Korin solemnly declared that the stewardess was not only enchantingly lovely, but that she could work magic in other ways too, until the man returned to inform Korin that the visa would cost him fifteen-thousand, fifteen-thousand! Korin repeated aloud, the color draining from his face as he stood up, but the man merely repeated fifteen-thousand, saying Korin could, if he wished, try going to the consulate himself, and stand in the long queue on his own, perhaps returning after three or four days, he might have the time to spare, but if he didn't this was the price, there was not much chance of anything else turning up, in consequence of which Korin excused himself and popped into the toilet, took three five-thousand notes from the lining of his coat, came out and handed the money over to the man who told him that everything would be all right, he could relax, for he would fill the necessary parts of the form out for Korin then take it in and go through all the proper procedures which meant he could stop fretting, it was all in the safest possible hands, he would have his darn visa by that afternoon and could therefore, he winked before disappearing with the appropriate information, take it easy for the next ten years, sleep soundly for ten years; and so Korin told the desk clerk that he would after all have need of a ticket for the next flight, then sat down again beside the stewardess and confessed that he had no idea what would happen to him if the old lady in the pushchair happened to arrive, for, to tell the truth, he had never flown before, had no idea what to do, was in constant need of advice and his prospects, which had brightened so dramatically, would immediately cloud over again if she was required to attend on the old lady with the wheelchair and so leave him.

All eyes in the office were directed at them, from the woman sitting behind the reception counter, through the agents at their desks in the background to the scattered individual browsers of brochures desirous of travel; not a pair of eyes but was fixed on them, on the whole incident, or rather what it signified, for there was no ready explanation for it: for the extraordinary beauty of the stewardess, since how could someone so beautiful be a stewardess or, indeed, a stewardess so beautiful; for the unwashed, smelly figure of Korin in his rumpled greatcoat, for how could someone traveling to America present such an appearance, or conversely, how could someone presenting such an appearance aspire to visit America; and above all for the fact that two such people could be in easy commerce with each other, on the best of terms, lost in a conversation so deep that its ultimate subject was beyond conjecture for it was being conducted in such passionate terms that it conveyed nothing beyond the passion itself, not even hinting at whether they were meeting for the first time or renewing an old acquaintance, both possibilities, as far as the office was concerned, remaining open: in other words the sight of such beauty worn with such regal modesty in combination with a figure of such beggarly degeneracy represented a serious disturbance in the even tenor of official life, indeed, as far as this sphere of existence was concerned, it signified a slowly developing scandal, since the stewardess was certainly no kind of queen, nor Korin a beggar, and therefore all anyone could do was to watch and wait, wait for this curious still-life to disintegrate, to be snuffed out, liquidated, since there could be no doubt that scene on the bench was in fact a kind of still-life, Korin with his degenerate beggarly appearance, his defenseless other-worldliness, and the stewardess with her enchanting body, that body's simmering sensuality; a still-life therefore with peculiar rules of its own meriting the peculiarly intense interest of its environment, as the stewardess herself explained later on the plane, an interest that she herself finally noticed, and when she saw how everyone was looking at them, it confused her, she said, and there was even something frightening about it, about everyone's eyes, the way they were looking at them, how should she put it? as if it were one single face staring and in a truly frightening fashion, frightening and comical, as she told them all about it on the way to Rome.

31
My predecessors were, on the whole, relaxed, said Korin after a period of silence, then, pulling a sour face, he scratched the top of his head and carefully accenting every word, added - but I was always fraught.

The nipples delicately pressed through the warm texture of the snow-white starched blouse while the deep décolletage boldly accentuated the graceful curvature and fragility of the neck, the gentle valleys of the shoulders and the light swaying to and fro of the sweetly compact masses of her breasts, though it was hard to tell whether it was these that drew all eyes inexorably to her, that refused to let the eyes escape, or if it was the short dark-blue skirt that clung to her hips and bound her long thighs tightly together while indicating the lines of her belly, or indeed if it was the lush and sparkling black hair that tumbled over her shoulders and the clear high brow, the beautifully sculpted jaw, the thick soft lips, the pretty slope of the nose, or those shining eyes in the depths of which two unquenchable spots of light glowed and would glow there for ever, that arrested them; in other words men and women caught in that moment in the office were quite unable to decide what it was that had such a spellbinding effect, so spellbinding that they could do nothing but stare at the several parts constituting this fever-inducing beauty, and what was more - bearing in mind the contrast between such a bountiful display of loveliness on the one hand and their own commonplace existence - they stared at her quite openly, the men with crude, long-suppressed hunger and naked desire, the women with a fine attention to the accumulation of detail, from top to bottom and back again, dizzy with the sensation but, driven by a malignant jealousy at the heart of their fierce inspection, surveying her with ever less sympathy, ever greater contempt, remarking, once the thing was over, or rather once this scandalous pair had disappeared separately through the exit of the MALÉV office, the women first, that it wasn't a matter of prejudice, for they too were women, and one woman always regards another in that light, so there could be no question of prejudice, but it was a little much the way this little strumpet of a stewardess, as one or two of them quickly interjected, pretended she was an innocent little angel, a meek, ready-to-please little princess, while, so the women in the office snorted once it was possible to get together behind the desk and address the subject properly, that tight blouse, the ultra-short skirt clinging to her ass giving an occasional glimpse of the long thighs and the white panties between the thighs, and the very fact that every part of this body, literally everything, was clearly on display, and was practically screaming for attention. well, they had seen quite enough of such apparent artlessness before and knew all too well how to work the little dodges that brought out the best but hid that which should be invisible, nor would they say anything but, really! the shameless deception of it, a blatant whore parading herself like some refined, regal presence, that! they all agreed, no-one would be taken in by nowadays, and later on, before they went home, stopping for a brief chat in the park or a bar, the male employees who had witnessed the scene, a customer or two, or managers further up the chain, contributed to the ongoing discussion by adding that such women were on to a winner every time, that she had a fantastic body, and these huge tits that really thrust themselves at you, and what's more, they added, she had a sweetly swaying round ass, and tits like that, and an ass like that,  not forgetting, they added,  a snow-white set of teeth and a charming smile, and given those shapely hips and a bit of graceful movement, and, to top it all, a glance, a perfectly timed glance that told you, you whose throat was quite parched by the sight of her, that you would be wrong, seriously wrong, if you thought that you would be at the receiving end of all this, because the glance also told you that the woman confronting you was a virgin, and what is more precisely the kind of virgin of all virgins who has no idea what she has been created for, in other words, taking it all into account, the men declared as they sat in the park or in the bar, if you took her on, they jabbed their fingers at their listeners, that would be the end of you, and they set out once more to describe the woman they had seen at the MALÉV office from her nipples down to her slender ankles, set out but could never finish what they started, since this woman, they kept repeating, was quite beyond words, because what did they achieve by telling you about the skirt glued to the hips and those long thighs, no more than the hair tumbling over her shoulders, those soft lips, the brow, the chin, the nose, really now, what did it add up to? they asked, for it was impossible, simply impossible to capture her in words, because what one ought to capture in beauty is that which is treacherous and irresistible, or, let's be perfectly honest: she was the vision of a truly magnificent, majestic female animal in a dismally synthetic world of sickness.

If anyone really and truly wished him success in his venture, it was she, declared the stewardess to the other crew members on board, though she was sure, she added, that once she had left him he would quickly have come unstuck and got pretty well nowhere, and most likely his name would have been dropped from the stand-by list by the time the Swiss lady in the wheelchair had turned up - almost three and a half hours late - which was when she had taken her leave of him, pushing the woman through the door of the office, yes, they'd have dropped his name off the list, the stewardess repeated with growing certainty, no doubt about it, absolutely none, not that she knew precisely who it was that would do the dropping, the people who are normally responsible for such decisions, she expected, policemen, psychiatric workers, security personnel, the usual suspects, because the way he looked it was a miracle that he had got within hailing distance of the MALEV office, and no-one who had had the briefest contact with him could believe he would get any further, so why should she believe it, however she might wish it were otherwise, for to get across town, out to the airport at Ferihegy and past the ticket inspectors, the customs people, the security guys, then to go on to America, no, no, no, the stewardess shook her head, it was unimaginable that he could manage all that, and even now, some two hours later, when she thought back over it, it all seemed like a dream to her, not that she had had a dream as strange as that in a long time, she confessed, nor had she any idea what it all added up to, this memory she now had stored away, for she was still too close to it, she couldn't really see anything, had no idea who he actually was, or anything about him except that she had immediately started making excuses for him and defending him without being able to make any categorical statements about him, in other words to defend him from some as-yet-unknown accusation, for example that of lunacy, for though he did at first sight appear to be a lunatic, he was, as she had already said, no fool, but, how should she express it, there was something about him, about this man, that was so solemn, so unusual, so - she felt justified in using the word - so startling in its absolute solemnity, that she couldn't but be struck by his sheer desperation, him being absolutely set on something, even though he couldn't articulate what it was, and no, she wasn't joking, she's not having them on, not just saying all this, and after a good sleep she would get over the experience, and once she was through it all, she said, pointing at herself, through all this 'may I talk to you' business, all this 'intensity', really, it would be she herself who would be thought crazy for getting involved in the first place, right? ah no, not at all, she would quite understand it if her colleagues thought she was crazy, so she would shut up now, leave off the story of this great soul-shaking encounter, and she was sorry to have bored them, and had a good giggle herself among the general merriment, adding only that it was sad the way we meet people by chance, spend time talking to them, acknowledge the fact that they have had some effect on us, then we lose them and never ever see them again, something genuinely sad, whatever anyone says, she repeated, laughing, really very sad.

It was Hermes, said Korin, Hermes lay at the heart of everything, that was his starting point, that was the foundation of his deepest intellectual experiences, and though he had never spoken of this to anyone before he simply had to tell the young lady stewardess that it was to Hermes he had been ultimately led, having time after time attempted to discover that hermetically-sealed beginning, had time after time attempted to understand it, to solve it, to get to the bottom of it, and not least of all, to recount it to those people that fate had so far brought him into contact with, to tell them how it was that he realized that he was not intended to be an ordinary archivist, not that he didn't want to be an archivist, for indeed he was most sincerely an archivist, but not an ordinary one, and what he sought to discover, what he constantly sought the answer to, was the reason why he wasn't ordinary; and so he kept going over and over things that had happened, extending his explorations ever further back in time, and there was always something there, something new about his past that made him think, this is it, I've got it, or rather he searched and searched for the source, the origo of this revolution in his life which eventually, some thirty and forty hours ago, had led him here, and to ever newer potential sources and origos, ever newer starting points and beginnings, until he reached the conclusion, he was pleased to say, the actual conclusion he had been seeking and the name of that conclusion was Hermes; for truly, he said, Hermes, for him, was that absolute origo, it was that encounter with the hermetic, the day, the hour he first encountered Hermes, when - if he might so put it - he became acquainted with the world of the hermetic and was afforded a glimpse into it, into that which Hermes presented as a world, the world of which Hermes was the ruler, Hermes, this Greek god, the twelfth of twelve, with his mystery, his lack of fixity, his copiously multi-faceted existence, his secret forms, the dark side of his being shrouded in a deeply suggestive silence who had had such a mesmerizing effect on his imagination, or, more precisely, had completely captured his imaginative faculties and made him restless, had drawn him into a sphere from which there was no escape, for it was like being under the spell or a curse or an incantation, since this is what Hermes was to him, not a god who led but one who misled, swept him off course, destabilized him, called him, drew him aside, seduced him from below, whispered to him from the wings; but why him, him in particular, why this archivist working some two-hundred and twenty kilometers from Budapest, he could not tell, nor should he seek after reasons, he felt, but simply accept that that was the way it was, it was the way he had learned of Hermes, possibly through the Homeric Hymns, or maybe from the psychoanalyst Kerényi, possibly from the marvelous Graves, who the hell knew or cared how, said Korin, this being, if he might so put it that way, the induction phase which was quickly followed by the next phase, the phase of deeper exploration in which the towering, unrivalled work of Walter F. Otto, that is to say his Die Götter Griechenlands, was the sole guide, and in that book exclusively one specific chapter in the Hungarian edition, which he read and re-read until it came to pieces in his hands , which was the point at which restlessness and anxiety entered his life, when things were no longer as they were, the day after which everything looked different, had changed, when the world showed him its most terrifying face, bringing on a sense of dissociation, offering the most terrifying aspect of absolute freedom, since knowledge of Hermes, said Korin, entails the loss of one's sense of being at home in this world, of the sense of belonging, of dependence, of certainty, and this means that suddenly there is an uncertainty factor in the totality of things, because, just as suddenly, it becomes clear that this uncertainty is the only, the sole factor, for Hermes signifies the provisional and relative nature of the laws of being, and Hermes brings and Hermes  takes such laws away, or rather allows them liberty, for that is the whole point of Hermes, said Korin to the stewardess, for whoever is granted a glimpse of him can never again yield himself to any ambition or form of knowledge, because ambition and knowledge are merely ragged cloaks, if he might use such a poetic turn of phrase, that one may adapt or cast off at a whim according to the teachings of Hermes, the god of the roads of night, of night itself, a night whose domain the presence of Hermes extends into day, since as soon as he appears anywhere he immediately changes human life, appearing to let days be, appearing to acknowledge the powers of his Olympian companions, and allowing everything to appear as though life continued to proceed according to the plans and schemes of his own, while whispering to his devotees that life was not quite like this, leading them into the night, showing them the inconceivably complex and chaotic nature of all paths, making them confront the unexpected, the accidental, the out--of-the-blue, the dangerous, the deeply confused and primitive states of possession, death and sexuality, expelling them, in other words, from Zeus's world of light and thrusting them into hermetic darkness, as he had thrust Korin ever since Korin had understood that a glimpse of him had induced a restlessness in his heart, a restlessness that could never cease once Hermes had revealed himself to him, a revelation that quite ruined him, for if there was one thing he did not wish to suggest it was that this discovery, this glimpse of Hermes indicated that he felt any love for Hermes, said Korin, no, he had no love for Hermes whatsoever but was simply frightened of him; and this is how things were, this is what happened and no more than this, that he had been scared by Hermes as would any man have been, any man who had realized at the moment of his ruin that he had been ruined, that is to say had come into the possession of such knowledge as he did not at all wish to possess, as was precisely the case with him, with Korin, for what did he desire that others did not? he had no desire to be different, to stand out from the crowd, he had no such ambitions, preferring relationships and security, homeliness and a clear and simple life, in other words absolutely ordinary things, though he lost these in the blinking of an eye the moment Hermes entered his life, and made of him, as he is happy to admit, a servant, an underling, since from that moment the underling began rapidly to distance himself from his wife, his neighbors and his colleagues, because it seemed hopeless even to try to explain, elaborate, or confess to the fact that it was a Greek god that lay at the root of the unmistakable changes in his behavior, not that he had any chance of getting others to sympathize with him, Korin told the stewardess, for just imagine him turning one day to his wife, or to his colleagues at the archive and saying to them, I am aware that you will have noticed a peculiar change in my behavior, well, it's all on account of a Greek god; just imagine the effect, said Korin, the way his wife would react to such a confession, or his colleagues to this explanation, in other words things could not have turned out otherwise than they did, a quick divorce, the rapid progress from peculiar looks at the office to being ignored, in fact some went so far as to avoid him altogether and refused to acknowledge him in the street, which was, said Korin, deeply hurtful, coming as it did from his own colleagues, people he met every day of his life, being utterly ignored in the street by them, thanks to Hermes, and everything that flowed from that right down to the present moment, not that he was complaining, merely establishing the facts, for what cause had he for complaint, though there was a time when he was no more than a simple, perfectly orthodox archivist who had every hope of progressing to the post of chief archivist, but now instead of that, would you believe it, said Korin, here he as in Budapest, in Budapest, if he might be allowed to jump forward in time, at the Budapest offices of MALÉV where he trusted and genuinely believed that he would receive a visa and a ticket enabling him, Korin, not only to get to the world-famous city of New York, but in doing so to achieve, and here he dropped his voice, the chief aim of his hermetic state of uncertainty, not to mention the fact, he added, that should he desire compensation, which he did not; or did he wish to exchange his state for some other, which he did not; an exchange of states might serve as a form of compensation, and though this kind of exchange was against the rules it was not in fact impossible, for it was not impossible that he might, any day now, get to see the deity, Hermes, personally, at some moment, for such moments did exist, moments when things were really calm, moments when he glanced towards a shady corner, afternoons when he had fallen asleep and woke to a flash of light in the room, or perhaps when it was getting dark and he was rushing somewhere the god might be there beside him, keeping pace with him, visible as the moon, waving his caduceus at something that was not him, in the distance before disappearing.

The visa arrived but they were still sitting in the same way in the same place on the bench set out to accommodate those who were waiting, since the old woman had not yet turned up, and on being shown the visa the people at the desk had nothing to add concerning his chances of getting a ticket, telling him off instead, asking him what his problem was, what was he getting so uppity and impatient about constantly jumping up and down like that instead of sitting down calmly and waiting to be called in his turn at the right time, because there were people out there who had been waiting for weeks, to which Korin naturally replied with an acquiescent nod, assuring the staff that he would stop being a nuisance to them, that from now on, having got the point, he would, he promised, no longer impose on them, and so saying, sat back down on the bench beside the stewardess and said nothing for the next few minutes, simply waited, clearly anxious in case his behavior had set the staff against him, which, he explained to the stewardess, would harm no one but him, then, suddenly, as if he had forgotten everything he had said earlier, turned to her again and continued from where he had just now left off, informing her that nothing would please him more than spending the entire week here, in continual conversation with her, though he himself did not quite understand what the hell it was that inspired him to launch out on his monologue, a monologue,  furthermore, that was exclusively about himself, for he had never done anything like this in his life, not once, Korin told the stewardess, gazing into her eyes, for it would have been inconceivable before, in fact if anything characterized him as he had been it was a reluctance to talk about himself, he'd not say a word to anyone on the subject, and if now he felt impelled, it was possibly because he was frightened that he might be attacked, fearing that they were on his trail, which was by no means a certainty, more a simple likelihood, in other words it must be this or some other related cause that made him launch out on this torrent of words, feeling that he had to tell all, the bit about the riverbank, about the psychotherapy, the hierarchy, the amnesia, about freedom and about the center of the world so that he, who had never previously been aware of the least talent for it, might at last initiate someone else into the secret story of the last years, the last months, the last day, telling them what happened at the archive, in the brake car, on the railway bridge and on Almássy Square; telling, in other words, everything, or, to be more accurate, the essential parts, though telling only the truly essential parts was becoming steadily harder, and not only because the whole consisted of individual details, details of which there was a maddening surfeit, but also because - a most humdrum problem - it made his head ache, or to be more precise made the headache he already had exceed its usual intensity so that it was becoming quite unbearable, or rather, he corrected himself, not even so much his head as his neck, his shoulders and the base of his skull, just there, he pointed out to the stewardess, and when you took all these pains into consideration, the whole effect, when it put its mind to it, could become unbearable, and there was nothing he could do about these attacks for nothing would help, not massage, not turning his head this way and that, not moving his shoulders about, nothing, the only cure was sleep, sleep alone could shift it, the complete and utter mental relaxation, the loss of all self-consciousness, though that was precisely the problem, that he never could relax his self-consciousness, never free himself of the tension in his head, he had to hold it just as he was now doing, though, naturally, it led to the cramping of the muscles and strained the ligaments, so that eventually the constitution of his whole upper body was in open revolt, at which he point he had no option, if the young lady would be so kind as to forgive him, but to lie down here in the bench, only for a minute of course, but lie down he must if only to relieve the strain on his muscles and ligaments, from the trapezium and the splenius, from the sub-occipital and the sternocleidomastodeum, for somehow the pressure had to be lifted or else the thing he had long feared would come to pass, that is to say his head would drop off, because that would surely happen, the whole caboodle would just collapse, and then there would be no New York, no nothing, said Korin, it would all be over before you could say Jack Robinson.

37
The stewardess stood up to make room for Korin, who gradually, carefully, arranged himself full-length along the bench but no sooner had he closed his eyes than he had to snap them open again because the door to the street was suddenly thrown open and a whole crowd of people thrust themselves through it, or to put it more precisely, erupted into the office with such brutal force it seemed they wanted to smash everything in their way, impatient of the slightest objection, shouting harsh instructions left and right, fore and aft, to the effect that the person they were delivering, who was now shoved forward in a brilliantly glistening ebony-black wheelchair, and who was now advancing through the ranks of would-be ticket purchasers and employees, had a quite particular reason for bursting in like this and had an absolute right to run people down while no one had any cause or justification to question this privilege, in other words, albeit half a day late, and to Korin's deepest disappointment but to the stewardess's great relief, the old woman from Switzerland had finally arrived in her very own skin-and-bone, dried-out body, her face fallen-in and scored over with a thousand wrinkles, her gray eyes tiny and lightless, her lips cracked, her ears decked out in an outsize set of gold earrings that dangled right down to her shoulders, her whole presence immediately, silently, declaring that it was with precisely this body, this face, these eyes, these lips and just these enormous earrings that she intended to determine what was going or not going to happen in the next few minutes; nor did she in fact say anything at all, and as to her entourage, it was clear that there was no communication of orders to them either, it being more a case of now a little this way, now a little faster, now a touch slower, while keeping their eyes firmly glued to her, hanging on to her the way the golden earrings did to her ears, until, with one gesture as minimal as the act of breathing she made it clear what she wanted, which way she wanted to go, which route they should take to which desk, a decision that neither the employees nor those waiting for tickets had any power to resist, for those behind the desks stopped working and the queues broke up, simultaneously bringing to an end the situation in which Korin, still cursed with his headache, and the stewardess found themselves, since Korin had, at the very least, after the first moment of terror, to sit up in order to convince himself that the deputation had not come for him, and the stewardess had to snap into action and announce that it was she whom MALÉV had, after the necessary formalities, together with the Helping Hands service, chosen to conduct the elderly lady to her chosen, specially selected flight, where she would be her supporter and aide, to be in the strict sense of the word, her guide on the road to the airport at Ferihegy.

37
The meat-filled pancake a la Hortobágy was fine, the old lady's translator conveyed to the nervous official, but the air - and here every member of the entourage allowed himself a smile - did not meet with Frau Hanzl's approval, no, eure Luft, as the old lady repeated in her loud, cracked rather masculine voice, shaking her head in a disillusioned manner, ist einfach unqualifizierbar, versteht ihr?, unqualifizierbar! after which, having indicated that she wished the computer monitor to be turned in her direction, she jabbed her finger at one of the lines, from which point everything happened improbably fast: no more than a minute or two had elapsed before her entourage was in full possession of a ticket and the stewardess had been informed what her duties were to be regarding "the acutely sensitive Mrs Hanzl who was in the habit of making all her own arrangements for travel", and the shiny ebony-black wheelchair containing the acutely sensitive Mrs Hanzl, was already turning and thundering across the hall towards the exit so that Korin, who was looking this way and that in panic had barely time enough to dash over to the stewardess and condense into a single sentence everything she absolutely had to know, since, he stared at her in desperation, there was so much he had not had time to say, the most important things in fact, having neglected to inform her of the very reason he had to get to New York and what he had to do there, indicating his coat sleeve and the manuscript of which he had not said a word so far though it was by far the most important aspect of the whole thing and the stewardess would understand nothing if she did not know that, for that manuscript - he grabbed her hand and tried to delay the gathering momentum of the procession - was the most extraordinary piece of writing that anyone had ever produced, but he could talk to the stewardess all he liked for she was no longer listening, having only time enough to smile and beg his forgiveness for having to get on now, in response to which Korin himself could do no more than run ahead, to prop the door open before the onrushing pushchair, and raise his voice above the din of the agitated procession of escorts to remark what a wonderful, unforgettable day it had been, and that the young stewardess lady should allow him to file away the two tiny dimples of her smile in his memory for ever, to which she replied smiling, with precisely those two tiny dimples, that he was most welcome to file them away, whereupon she waved and disappeared behind the closing door, leaving Korin alone in the suddenly ear-splitting silence with only the eternal memory of those two little dimples to console him.

38
For 119,00 forints he could have a week in Iceland, one bored official told him, rattling the figures off; for 99,900 a week on the Nile, for 98,000 a week in Tenerife, for 75,900 five days in London, 69,000 for a week in Cyprus or Mallorca, 49,900 for a week on the Turkish Riviera, 39,900 for a week in Rhodes, 34,900 for the same in Corfu, 24,900 for Dubrovnik or Athens-Thessaloniki, 24,000 for a week at the Cloisters in Meteora, Jesolo was 22,900, Salou in Spain 19,900, or he could have eight days in Kraljevica for 18,200 forints, and if none of those appealed to him, he told the customer standing at the desk, for he appeared to be dithering, then, the agent turned his head away and made a moue with his mouth, he was perfectly free to go elsewhere, and so saying he pressed a button on his computer, tipped his chair back and stared at the ceiling with an expression that clearly declared that he, for his part, had given out as much information as he felt bound to and was not going to give out one jot more.

39
What ticket for what flight? Korin enquired at the desk later when they called him up to tell him the news, and started massaging his forehead the way people do when they want to summon up their lost concentration, cutting the operative short by asking: Tomorrow? What do you mean tomorrow?

40
There were four of them altogether, three female adults aged between fifty and sixty, and a girl who looked about eighteen but was certainly no more than twelve years old, each of them arriving with a steel bucket full of cleaning apparatus and carrying a half-sized industrial broom in her left hand: four buckets, four brooms and four sets of gray cleaners' lab-coats, ensuring their clear identification and function and explaining why they were now ready and waiting for something, squinting upward at everyone else, fixed in this inferior position keeping their eyes peeled for a sign from their supervisor who stood in the doorway of a glass cubicle, and when the sign eventually came they were set to go about their business, carefully at first, with a number of uncertain preparatory gestures, then, as the last of the officials and employees disappeared through the door, and the shutters at the front clattered down, switching to full speed with the brooms and buckets, the four of them in their uniforms, two in front, two remaining on the street side, wringing out the cloths wound round the brooms then dipping them into water again, the brooms dripping, two on one side, two on the other, the cleaners taking long extended strides, solemnly, without a word, so that the only sound audible was of the four improvised mops sliding quickly across the fake-marble slabs of the floor, and then, as they reached the center and passed each other, one or two slight smacking sounds, then that sliding noise across the paving again, to the end of the room, then a dipping and wringing and back again, as wordless as before, until the girl reached into the pocket of her coat to turn on a small transistor, turning up the volume, so from that moment they moved in a dense, echoing, monotonous aspic of sound, like machines, with brooms in their hands, their empty whey-coloured eyes fixed on their damp mops.
@ Nothing


For Carl Solomon 

I

I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked,

dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix,

angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night,

who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in the supernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities contemplating jazz,

who bared their brains to Heaven under the El and saw Mohammedan angels staggering on tenement roofs illuminated,

who passed through universities with radiant eyes hallucinating Arkansas and Blake-light tragedy among the scholars of war,

who were expelled from the academies for crazy & publishing obscene odes on the windows of the skull,

who cowered in unshaven rooms in underwear, burning their money in wastebaskets and listening to the Terror through the wall,

who got busted in their pubic beards returning through Laredo with a belt of marijuana for New York,

who ate fire in paint hotels or drank turpentine in Paradise Alley, death, or purgatoried their torsos night after night

with dreams, with drugs, with waking nightmares, alcohol and cock and endless balls,

incomparable blind streets of shuddering cloud and lightning in the mind leaping towards poles of Canada & Paterson, illuminating all the motionless world of Time between,

Peyote solidities of halls, backyard green tree cemetery dawns, wine drunkenness over the rooftops, storefront boroughs of teahead joyride neon blinking traffic light, sun and moon and tree vibrations in the roaring winter dusks of Brooklyn, ashcan rantings and kind king light of mind,

who chained themselves to subways for the endless ride from Battery to holy Bronx on benzedrine until the noise of wheels and children brought them down shuddering mouth-wracked and battered bleak of brain all drained of brilliance in the drear light of Zoo,

who sank all night in submarine light of Bickford's floated out and sat through the stale beer afternoon in desolate Fugazzi's, listening to the crack of doom on the hydrogen jukebox,

who talked continuously seventy hours from park to pad to bar to Bellevue to museum to the Brooklyn Bridge,

a lost batallion of platonic conversationalists jumping down the stoops off fire escapes off windowsills off Empire State out of the moon

yacketayakking screaming vomiting whispering facts and memories and anecdotes and eyeball kicks and shocks of hospitals and jails and wars,

whose intellects disgorged in total recall for seven days and nights with brilliant eyes, meat for the Synagogue cast on the pavement,

who vanished into nowhere Zen New Jersey leaving a trail of ambiguous picture postcards of Atlantic City Hall,

suffering Eastern sweats and Tangerian bone-grindings and migraines of China under junk-withdrawal in Newark's bleak furnished room,

who wandered around and around at midnight in the railway yard wondering where to go, and went, leaving no broken hearts,

who lit cigarettes in boxcars boxcars boxcars racketing through snow toward lonesome farms in grandfather night,

who studied Plotinus Poe St John of the Cross telepathy and bop kabbalah because the universe instinctively vibrated at their feet in Kansas,

who loned it through the streets of Idaho seeking visionary indian angels who were visionary indian angels,

who thought they were only mad when Baltimore gleamed in supernatural ecstasy,

who jumped in limousines with the Chinaman of Oklahoma on the impulse of winter midnight streetlight smalltown rain,

who lounged hungry and lonesome through Houston seeking jazz or sex or soup, and followed the brilliant Spaniard to converse about America and Eternity, a hopeless task, and so took ship to Africa,

who disappeared into the volcanoes of Mexico leaving nothing behind but the shadow of dungarees and the larva and ash of poetry scattered in fireplace Chicago,

who reappeared on the West Coast investigating the FBI in beards and shorts with big pacifist eyes sexy in their dark skin passing out incomprehensible leaflets,

who burned cigarette holes in their arms protesting the narcotic tobacco haze of Capitalism, who distributed Supercommunist pamphlets in Union Square weeping and undressing while the sirens of Los Alamos wailed them down, and wailed down Wall, and the Staten Island ferry also wailed,

who broke down crying in white gymnasiums naked and trembling before the machinery of other skeletons,

who bit detectives in the neck and shrieked with delight in policecars for committing no crime but their own wild cooking pederasty and intoxication,

who howled on their knees in the subway and were dragged off the roof waving genitals and manuscripts,

who let themselves be fucked in the ass by saintly motorcyclists, and screamed with joy,

who blew and were blown by those human seraphim, the sailors, caresses of Atlantic and Caribbean love,

who balled in the morning in the evenings in rosegardens and the grass of public parks and cemeteries scattering their semen freely to whomever come who may, 

who hiccuped endlessly trying to giggle but wound up with a sob behind a partition in a Turkish Bath when the blond & naked angel came to pierce them with a sword,

who lost their loveboys to the three old shrews of fate the one eyed shrew of the heterosexual dollar the one eyed shrew that winks out of the womb and the one eyed shrew that does nothing but sit on her ass and snip the intellectual golden threads of the craftsman's loom,

who copulated ecstatic and insatiate and fell off the bed, and continued along the floor and down the hall and ended fainting on the wall with a vision of ultimate cunt and come eluding the last gyzym of consciousness,

who sweetened the snatches of a million girls trembling in the sunset, and were red eyed in the morning but were prepared to sweeten the snatch of the sunrise, flashing buttocks under barns and naked in the lake,

who went out whoring through Colorado in myriad stolen night-cars, N.C., secret hero of these poems, cocksman and Adonis of Denver—joy to the memory of his innumerable lays of girls in empty lots & diner backyards, moviehouses' rickety rows, on mountaintops in caves or with gaunt waitresses in familiar roadside lonely petticoat upliftings & especially secret gas-station solipsisms of johns, & hometown alleys too,

who faded out in vast sordid movies, were shifted in dreams, woke on a sudden Manhattan, and picked themselves up out of basements hungover with heartless Tokay and horrors of Third Avenue iron dreams & stumbled to unemployment offices,

who walked all night with their shoes full of blood on the snowbank docks waiting for a door in the East River to open full of steamheat and opium,

who created great suicidal dramas on the appartment cliff-banks of the Hudson under the wartime blue floodlight of the moon & their heads shall be crowned with laurel in oblivion,

who ate the lamb stew of the imagination or digested the crab at the muddy bottom of the rivers of the Bowery,

who wept at the romance of the streets with their pushcarts full of onions and bad music,

who sat in boxes breathing in the darkness under the bridge, and rose up to build harpsichords in their lofts, who coughed on the sixth floor of Harlem crowned with flame under the tubercular sky surrounded by orange crates of theology,

who scribbled all night rocking and rolling over lofty incantations which in the yellow morning were stanzas of gibberish,

who cooked rotten animals lung heart feet tail borsht & tortillas dreaming of the pure vegetable kingdom,

who plunged themselves under meat trucks looking for an egg,

who threw their watches off the roof to cast their ballot for an Eternity outside of Time, & alarm clocks fell on their heads every day for the next decade,

who cut their wrists three times successfully unsuccessfully, gave up and were forced to open antique stores where they thought they were growing old and cried,

who were burned alive in their innocent flannel suits on Madison Avenue amid blasts of leaden verse & the tanked-up clatter of the iron regiments of fashion & the nitroglycerine shrieks of the fairies of advertising & the mustard gas of sinister intelligent editors, or were run down by the drunken taxicabs of Absolute Reality,

who jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge this actually happened and walked away unknown and forgotten into the ghostly daze of Chinatown soup alleyways & firetrucks, not even one free beer,

who sang out of their windows in despair, fell out of the subway window, jumped in the filthy Passaic, leaped on negroes, cried all over the street, danced on broken wineglasses barefoot smashed phonograph records of nostalgic European 1930s German jazz finished the whiskey and threw up groaning into the bloody toilet, moans in their ears and the blast of colossal steamwhistles,

who barreled down the highways of the past journeying to each other's hotrod-Golgotha jail-solitude watch Birmingham jazz incarnation,

who drove crosscountry seventytwo hours to find out if I had a vision or you had a vision or he had a vision to find out Eternity,

who journeyed to Denver, who died in Denver, who came back to Denver & waited in vain, who watched over Denver & brooded & loned in Denver and finally went away to find out the Time, & now Denver is lonesome for her heroes,

who fell on their knees in hopeless cathedrals praying for each other's salvation and light and breasts, until the soul illuminated its hair for a second,

who crashed through their minds in jail waiting for impossible criminals with golden heads and the charm of reality in their hearts who sang sweet blues to Alcatraz,

who retired to Mexico to cultivate a habit, or Rocky Mount to tender Buddha or Tangiers to boys or Southern Pacific to the black locomotive or Harvard to Narcissus to Woodlawn to the daisychain or grave,

who demanded sanity trials accusing the radio of hypnotism & were left with their insanity & their hands & a hung jury,

who threw potato salad at CCNY lecturerson Dadaism and subsequently presented themselves on the granite steps of the madhouse with the shaven heads and harlequin speech of suicide, demanding instantaneous lobotomy,

and who were given instead the concrete void of insulin Metrazol electricity hydrotherapy psychotherapy occupational therapy pingpong & amnesia,

who in humorless protest overturned only one symbolic pingpong table, resting briefly in catatonia,

returning years later truly bald except for a wig of blood, and tears and fingers, to the visible madman doom of the wards of the madtowns of the East,

Pilgrim State's Rockland's and Greystone's foetid halls, bickering with the echoes of the soul, rocking and rolling in the midnight solitude-bench dolmen-realms of love, dream of life a nightmare, bodies turned to stone as heavy as the moon,

with mother finally *****, and the last fantastic book flung out of the tenement window, and the last door closed at 4 A.M. and the last telephone slammed at the wall in reply and the last furnished room emptied down to the last piece of mental furniture, a yellow paper rose twisted on a wire hanger on the closet, and even that imaginary, nothing but a hopeful little bit of hallucination—

ah, Carl, while you are not safe I am not safe, and now you're really in the total animal soup of time—

and who therefore ran through the icy streets obsessed with a sudden flash of the alchemy of the use of the ellipse the catalog the meter & the vibrating plane,

who dreamt and made incarnate gaps in Time & Space through images juxtaposed, and trapped the archangel of the soulbetween 2 visual images and joined the elemental verbs and set the noun and dash of consciousness together jumping with sensation of Pater Omnipotens Aeterna Deus

to recreate the syntax and measure of poor human prose and stand before you speechless and intelligent and shaking with shame, rejected yet confessing out the soul to conform to the rhythm of thought in his naked and endless head,

the madman bum and angel beat in Time, unknown, yet putting down here what might be left to say in time come after death,

and rose incarnate in the ghostly clothes of jazz in the goldhorn shadow of the band and blew the suffering of America's naked mind for love into an eli eli lamma lamma sabacthani saxophone cry that shivered the cities down to the last radio

with the absolute heart of the poem butchered out of their own bodies good to eat a thousand years.

     Inside Dachau


1. big lies, small lies

Having lied to our German hosts about our plans 
for the day, Diane and I visited Dachau 
instead of searching for rare albums in Munich. 
Only a dozen visitors walked through the camp 
because we were months away from tourist season. 
The camp was austere. The museum was simple.

Once there, I had expected to feel simple 
emotions: hate, anger, sorrow. That was my plan. 
I would write poetry about how the season 
of winter found a perfect home in cold Dachau. 
I would be a Jewish man who died in the camp. 
I would be the ideal metaphor. Munich

would be a short train ride away from hell. Munich 
would take the blame. I thought it would all be simple 
but there were no easy answers inside the camp. 
The poems still took their forms, but my earlier plans 
seemed so selfish. What could I say about Dachau 
when I had never suffered through any season

inside its walls? Could I imagine a season 
of ash and snow, of flames and shallow graves? Munich 
is only a short train ride away from Dachau. 
If you can speak some German, it is a simple 
journey which requires coins and no other plans 
for the day. We lied about visiting the camp

to our German hosts, who always spoke of the camp 
as truthfully as they spoke about the seasons. 
Dachau is still Dachau. Our hosts have made no plans 
to believe otherwise. As we drove through Munich 
our hosts pointed out former Nazi homes, simply 
and quickly. "We are truly ashamed of Dachau,"

Mikael said, "but what about all the Dachaus
in the United States? What about the death camps 
in your country?" Yes, Mikael, you ask simple 
questions which are ignored, season after season. 
Mikael, I'm sorry we lied about Munich 
and Dachau. I'm sorry we lied about our plans.

Inside Dachau, you might believe winter will never end. You may lose faith in the change of seasons
because some of the men who built the camps still live in Argentina, in Washington, in Munich.
They live simple lives. They share bread with sons and daughters who have come to understand the master plan.

 

2. history as the home movie

it begins and ends with ash, though we insist
on ignoring the shared fires in our past.
We attempt to erase our names from the list
            that begins and ends with ash.
We ignore the war until we are the last 
standing, until we are the last to persist 
in denial, as we are shipped off to camps

where we all are stripped, and our dark bodies lit 
by the cruel light of those antique Jew-skinned lamps. 
Decades after Dachau fell, we stand in mist 
            that begins and ends with ash.
 

3. commonly asked questions

Why are we here? What have we come to see?
What do we need to find behind the doors?
Are we searching for an apology

from the ghosts of unrepentant Nazis?
We pay the entrance fee at the front door.
Why are we here? What have we come to see?

The actors have moved on to the next scene 
and set: furnace, shovel, and soot-stained door. 
Are we searching for an apology

from all the Germans who refused to see 
the ash falling in front of their locked doors? 
Why are we here? What have we come to see

that cannot be seen in other countries? 
Every country hides behind a white door. 
Are we searching for an apology

from the patient men who've hidden the keys? 
Listen: a door is a door is a door.
Why are we here? What have we come to see? 
Are we searching for an apology?

 

4. the american indian holocaust museum

What do we indigenous people want from our country?
We stand over mass graves. Our collective grief makes us numb. 
We are waiting for the construction of our museum.

We too could stack the shoes of our dead and fill a city 
to its thirteenth floor. What did you expect us to become? 
What do we indigenous people want from our country? 
We are waiting for the construction of our museum.

We are the great-grandchildren of Sand Creek and Wounded Knee. 
We are the veterans of the Indian wars. We are the sons 
and daughters of the walking dead. We have lost everyone. 
What do we indigenous people want from our country? 
We stand over mass graves. Our collective grief makes us numb. 
We are waiting for the construction of our museum.

 

5. songs from those who love the flames

We start the fires
on the church spire:
ash, ash.
We build tall pyres
from children's choirs:
ash, ash.
We watch flames gyre
and burn the liars:
ash, ash.

We watch flames gyre
from children's choirs:
ash, ash.
We start the fires
and burn the liars:
ash, ash.
We build tall pyres
on the church spire.
ash, ash.

We build tall pyres
and burn the liars:
ash, ash.
We watch flames gyre

6. after we are free

If I were Jewish, how would I mourn the dead?
I am Spokane. I wake.

If I were Jewish, how would I remember the past?
I am Spokane. I page through the history books.

If I were Jewish, how would I find the joy to dance?
I am Spokane. I drop a quarter into the jukebox.

If I were Jewish, how would I find time to sing?
I am Spokane. I sit at the drum with all of my cousins.

If I were Jewish, how would I fall in love?
I am Spokane. I listen to an Indian woman whispering.

If I were Jewish, how would I feel about ash?
I am Spokane. I offer tobacco to all of my guests.

If I were Jewish, how would I tell the stories? 
I am Spokane. I rest my hands on the podium.

If I were Jewish, how would I sleep at night?
I am Spokane. I keep the television playing until dawn.

If I were Jewish, how would I find my home?
I am Spokane. I step into the river and close my eyes.

 

7. below freezing

Dachau was so cold I could see my breath 
so I was thankful for my overcoat.
I have nothing new to say about death

Each building sat at right angles to the rest. 
Around each corner, I expected ghosts.
Dachau was so cold I could see my breath.

Everything was clean, history compressed 
into shoes, photographs, private notes. 
I have nothing new to say about death.

I wanted to weep. I wanted to rest
my weary head as the ash mixed with snow. 
Dachau was so cold I could see my breath.

I am not a Jew. I was just a guest
in that theater which will never close. 
I have nothing new to say about death.

I wonder which people will light fires next
and which people will soon be turned to smoke. 
Dachau was so cold I could see my breath. 
I have nothing new to say about death.



I Would Steal Horses

For Kari 

for you, if there were any left,
give a dozen of the best
to your father, the auto mechanic
in the small town where you were born

and where he will die sometime by dark.
I am afraid of his hands, which have
rebuilt more of the small parts
of this world than I ever will.

I would sign treaties for you, take
every promise as the last lie, the last
point after which we both refuse the exact.

I would wrap us both in old blankets
hold every disease tight against our skin.



Little Big Man 

I got eyes, Jack, that can see 
an ant moving along the horizon
can pull four bottles shattering
down from the sky and recognize
the eyes of a blind man

who told me once, The future is yours
and I believed him until he left me
without a campfire, without an axe
to chop down a tree and build myself
a chair, house, cold drink.

Jack, how much pain is thre
in the world? I think there's only one kind
and we all keep moving around it in circles
like clumsy pioneers, over the same ground
until the landscape becomes so familiar
we settle down and call it home.

Seems like everybody wants to be an Indian.
Why should you be any different, Jack?
Still, when you rub the red dirt off your pale nose
your little insanities vanish.
Listen: the proof is glass.
When an Indian looks through a window
it's like a mirror. When the Indian looks
into a mirror, it's like a window.

I know you have dreams, Jack. We all want
an acre of land, love, and a full stomach.
Without that, we couldn't listen to the wind
without anger. But I've been sitting in a cold room
watching stars through a hole in the roof.
That bright star to the north doesn't have a name
I know. Like everything else, it will break my heart.

What the Orphan Inherits


Language

I dreamed I was digging your grave
with my bare hands.  I touched your face
and skin fell in thin strips to the ground

until only your tongue remained whole.
I hung it to smoke with the deer
for seven days.  It tasted thick and greasy

sinew gripped my tongue tight.  I rose
to walk naked through the fire. I spoke
English.  I was not consumed.


Names 
I do not have an Indian name.
The wind never spoke to my mother
when I was born.  My heart was hidden
beneath the shells of walnuts switched
back and forth.  I have to cheat to feel
the beating of drums in my chest.


Alcohol 
“For bringing us the horse
we could almost forgive you
for bringing us whisky.”


Time
Indian boys
Sinewy and doe-eyed
Frozen in headlights.

 

 

Poverty of Mirrors

You wake these mornings alone and nothing
can be forgiven; you drink the last
swallow of warm beer from the can
beside the bed, tell the stranger sleeping
on the floor to go home. It's too easy

to be no one with nothing to do, only
slightly worried about the light bill
more concerned with how dark day gets.

You walk alone on moist pavement wondering
what color rain is in the country.
Does the world out there revolve around rooms
without doors or windows? Centering the mirror
you found in the trash, walls seem closer
and you can never find the right way

out, so you open the fridge again
for a beer, find only rancid milk and drink it
whole. This all tastes too familiar.

 

Memorial Day, 1972

I was too young to clean graves
so I waded into the uranium river
carrying the cat who later gave birth
to six headless kittens.

O, Lord, remember, O, do remember me.

 

Water

I know a woman
who swims naked
in the ocean
no matter the season.

I don't have a reason
for telling you this (I never
witnessed her early morning
dips into the salt) other than
to let you know that I once found
the thought of her nudity erotic

but now can only imagine 
the incredible cold, how I would want
to cover her body with my coat
and tell her how crazy she is
for having so much faith
in two parts hydrogen, one part oxygen.

2.

While reading a mystery novel (I
don't remember the title), I

dropped a cup of hot tea
into my lap. Third degree burns

on my thighs, penis, and scrotum. I
still have the scars and once told

a white woman they were the result
of a highly sacred Spokane Indian adulthood ceremony.

3.

I knew a man
who drowned in three inches of water.

Rain collected
in a tire track.

His family and friends accuse me
of making light

of his death, but I insist
on my innocence. Lord, I think

his death is tragic, possibly epic
the first and last act

of a reservation opera, and I wish
I could use his name here, make him

remembered, but I am forbidden
from doing so by tribal laws

that are more important than any poem.
But I want to give him a name

that means what I say, and I so I name him
Hamlet, King Lear, Othello, Noah, Adam.

4.

Boo tells me, "Whenever I feel depressed or lonely
I drink a glass of water and immediately feel better."

5.

In the unlikely event of a water landing
you can use your seat cushion as a floatation device.

I worry about this.

I wonder if the puny cushion can possibly support
my weight. I am a large man. In the unlikely event
of a water landing, you can use your seat cushion
as a floatation device. Of course, we don't crash.
We land safely. We always land safely. And Ha! Ha!
the flight attendant tells the disembarking passengers
to drive safely away from the airport because driving is
so much more dangerous, statistically speaking, than flying.

I want to slap her across the mouth, statistically speaking.

In the unlikely event of a water landing, you can use
your seat cushion as a floatation device. I am suddenly afraid
of gravity so I take my seat cushion off the plane. I steal
the damn thing and run through the airport, chased
by an ever increasing number of security people, 
men and women, so I'm glad this airport has progressed
beyond an antiquated notion of gender roles. But wait, 

I have no time to be liberal, I have to run fast, so I do run fast
with that seat cushion pressed tightly against my chest.
I cannot run fast enough in such an awkward position
as I am a large man with large hands. I cannot easily hide.
I cannot blend into the crowd. I cannot duck behind
the counter of the Burger King and ask for your order, your order, your
order.

Oh, in the event of a water landing, you can use your seat cushion
as a floatation device, and here I am, running, and praying as I run,
every step shouting Lord, Lord, Lord, every other step whispering

amen, amen, amen.

6.

At the restaurant, I ask the waiter to leave the pitcher of water
because I drink lots of water.

I can't do that, he says.

Why not? I ask.

Because we never leave the pitcher, he says.

Not once? I ask.

Never, he says, have we ever left a whole pitcher of water, not once 
in the entire history of this restaurant. It is impossible for us to do so. 
It is inconceivable for us to even consider such a thing. Who knows
what would happen if we set such a precedent?

7.

When I was seven, I took swim lessons at the YMCA
from three beautiful teenagers who all seemed like women to me.

They hugged me when they saw me waiting in line
to see JAWS at the Fox Theater in downtown Spokane.

Where are those girls now? Somewhere, they are being women.

Do they remember teaching me how to swim? Do they
recognize my face when they pick up the local newspaper
or see my photograph on the back of my latest book?

Oh, strange, strange ego.

Here, I've decided I want them to love me from afar. I want them
to regret their whole lives because they were once sixteen years old
swimmers who never stopped to passionately kiss
the seven year old me, as I floated
from the deep end of the pool back to the shallow.

8.

My brother, the big one, says, "It ain't water
unless it's got some Kool-aid in it."

9.

My wife, the Hidatsa Indian, grew up in Southern California
with a swimming pool. Wow!

Her father, the trickster, called relatives back home
in North Dakota. Called them in late December
when trees were exploding in the high plains cold. 
Called them and said, He held the phone up to the air, toward
the empty pool, because it was too cold to swim in December, even
in Southern California, but the North Dakota Indians didn't know
any better, so they were jealous and happy at the same time.

My wife, just a child then of five or ten or eighteen years old,
heard the slurred laughter of her father, the drunk, and
maybe he would laugh and get off the phone and be charming
or maybe he would be the cruel bastard, but there was no way
of knowing until he got off the phone, so she'd sit in her room
with a glass of water on the windowsill, oh, she'd be praying
to that glass of water, oh, she'd be praying
like everything was two parts broken heart and one part hope.

 

Why Indian Men Fall in Love With White Women

"This is how it is," says the white woman in the donut shop (it wasn't
a donut shop but something else entirely) and then she laughs
a melodious, joyous noise, and she smacks a hand, her left one
I believe, to her forehead in mock-Lucy exasperation, and then says
again, "This is how it is," but then adds as an afterthought, or

considering the use of the pun, perhaps had planned on saying it
all along, saying, "This is my job," except she doesn't say job, as
in work, she says Job, with a long vowel, as in the guy from the Bible.
Of course, this makes me love her, because if she said it
as an afterthought, then she is bright, but if she had always planned

to say it, to say Job, like the Job in the Bible, who had the worst job
in human history, then she is disciplined. She sais "This is my Job,"
as an afterthought, or as part of her daily script, I don't care which.
She says Job with the job, the job belonging to Job, Job possessed
by his job, the Job, the job, the Job, the job. Is the white woman

in the donut shop really that clever, and let's admit it, the pun
is not truly that clever, but clever enough, perhaps too clever
for a woman working in a donut shop (but it wasn't really
a donut shop), but I don't really care to guess at the exact level
of her education, because she laughs so joyously, because her eyes

are blue and alive with happiness and intelligence, so I decide
right there in the donut shop, that she is indeed too clever to be
working in a donut shop, that she is, in fact, a scholar who turned
her back on her academic pursuits, that she was a theologian
a blessed and gifted woman who wanted to be a priest, a Jesuit

an Ignation, of all things, but was turned back by the Catholic Church
and its antiquated notions of gender. She is romantic and novel
and more than a little sad, but she disguises her sadness so well
behind her blue eyes, though I am sensitive enough to see enough
of her sadness to guess at the whole of her sadness, even as she laughs

even as she takes my sympathetic order for a dozen donuts, as she gathers
the donuts into the appropriate container, as she hands it to me, as
our hands touch, as the tips of her fingers brush against the tips
of my fingers, as we briefly share a moment, and by "moment," I mean
a segment of immeasurable time, and in that moment, I feel forgiven

or perhaps I am merely aroused sexually and/or spiritually, but
in either case, I take a donut (maple?) from my appropriate container
and offer it to her, and she takes it with delight (she still loves
donuts, despite the Job-ness of her job), and she bites into it
and chews it without suggestion. She chews simply

with and without grace. She chews like a monk. She is that flour;
she is that egg; she is that sugar; she is that water. She is that flour;
she is that egg; she is that sugar; she is that water; She is the whole
of the donut; she is the hole of the donuts. She is the blue tear
balanced on the lower lid of her left eye. She is Job, my dear Job.

 

Owl Dancing with Fred Astaire

During a traditional Native American owl dance, the woman asks the man to dance. He is not supposed to refuse. However, if he does refuse, he must pay the woman whatever she wants and then tell the entire crowd at the powwow exactly why he refused.

 

I. 

I met the Indian woman who asked Fred Astaire to dance.
He politely refused her offer. “He was so charming,” she said, “even when he rejected me.
But I kept wishing it was an owl dance.”

II.

An owl dance is simple: two steps with your left foot forward,
one step with your right foot back, all to the beat of a drum currently being pounded by six Indian men in baseball hats.
They sing falsetto. Many non-Indians wonder what they are singing but that is too complicated to explain here. Let’s just say
they are singing an owl dance song. It is not necessarily romantic. I mean, sisters owl dance with brothers
and sons owl dance with their mothers. Yet, at every powwow, there are beautiful Indian women
who owl dance with beautiful Indian men, all hoping for love/sex/a brief vacation from loneliness.
I must emphasize, however, that our love lives are not simple.There are Indian men who have never been asked to owl dance.
Alone in the powwow crowd, those men tap their feet lightly along with the drums. They sing softly under their breath.
Perhaps they secretly wish they were Fred Astaire.

III.

Fred Astaire is gone now.
He is dead.
He will not be coming back.
However, if you watch his movies
you will notice
that he often smiles. What was he thinking?
Was he merely pleased with himself
for being Fred Astaire or was he completely unaware
of the camera and crew?
Was he dancing simply for the love of dancing? I don’t know
and you will never know either.
Only Fred Astaire knew and he was very good at keeping a secret
or so I am told
by the people who helped keep his secrets.

IV.

In my dream, Fred Astaire stumbles (yes, stumbles)
into the powwow and is shocked by the number of Indians who have survived
the smallpox blankets, U.S. Cavalry, relocation, etc. He smiles because, well, he is a good man prone to smiling.
(I must emphasize, however, that there are also bad men who are prone to smiling.) Fred Astaire loves the drums.
He is pleasantly surprised by the quality of the singing. Such pitch! and timbre! and range! and projection!
Fred Astaire taps his foot. He is wearing a tuxedo. He is the skinniest white man in the history of the world.
Can you see him? He is not all that handsome but he looks like a dancer. A great dancer.
In all cultures, women will choose a homely great dancer over a handsome non-dancer. Fred Astaire is confident.
He waits for the next owl dance to begin.

V.

Ask yourself this: How many times in your life
are you going to be asked to dance? Take that number and divide it by the number of men and/or women
who have expressed deep affection for you. If that number is X, then Y = heartbreak + X.
And, or course, Y is always equal to Fred Astaire.

 

At Navajo Monument Valley Tribal School

from the photograph
by Skeet McAuley 
the football field rises 
to meet the mesa. Indian boys 
gallop across the grass, against

the beginnings of their body. 
On those Saturday afternoons, 
unbroken horses gather to watch

their sons growing larger 
in the small parts of the world.
Everyone is the quarterback.

There is no thin man in a big hat 
writing down all the names 
in two columns: winners and losers.

This is the eternal football game, 
Indians versus Indians. All the Skins 
in the wooden bleachers fancydancing,

stomping red dust straight down 
into nothing. Before the game is over, 
the eighth-grade girls' track team

comes running, circling the field, 
their thin and brown legs echoing 
wild horses, wild horses, wild horses.

 

The Farm

1. Jonah
All of us, the Indians, know exactly where we were
when scientists announced that they had found the cure

for cancer. I was eating lunch in the Tribal Cafe
for the third time that week and was only halfway

through my fry bread when the national news broke
into the local news: a white man in a lab coat

stood at a podium porcupined with microphones
and quietly spoke. "We have found that the bone

marrow of Indians, synthesized with a few trace
elements, form a powerful antiviral agent named

Steptoe 123. This agent, when taken orally, will
stop the metastatic growth of tumors and kill

cancer cells. Steptoe 123 has been 95% effective
in ten years of research under the direction

of Dr. Miles Steptoe at the Center for Disease
Control. We have prepared a detailed press release

which will give you more information on Steptoe
123, Dr. Steptoe, and all that you need to know

at this time. The President, with a clear vision
of the future of Steptoe 123, has made a decision.

Therefore, under the authority of Executive Order
1492, we have closed all of the reservation borders

within the United States and will keep them closed
to any and all unauthorized traffic until further notice."

Silence. Then I turned to Charlie the Cook, who was really
the dishwater. "Jonah," he asked me. "Is it real?"

"It's real," I said. Charlie looked at me, looked|
at Agnes the Waitress, who was really the cook.

"Why is it real?" asked Charlie, but it was too late
for a history lesson. We all needed to escape

before the borders were completely shut down.
"We've got to go," I said. "We've got to go now."

So Agnes, Charlie, and I jumped into my old car
and prayed it would save us like that famous ark

but we didn't even make it past
Cold Springs before we heard the first dissonant

music: the helicopters played ragtime as they fell
from Heaven, as one descended on us with propeller
I drove the car off the road and into a field

where everything stopped
as Sam the Indian, who

was really white, suddenly stepped onto the road
with his hands out, palms open, just inches below

that helicopter, as Charlie asked, "Where did he
come from?" I just remember Sam was whittled

to bone as he helicopter dropped down onto him.
(Did you know you can play a gospel hymn

on a flute carved from human bone? I heard
the hymn once, in a dream, but have since learned

to play it on a hollow femur.) The soldiers came
for us then, dragged us from the car, asked for our names

and tribal affiliations, demanded to know if the guy
killed under the helicopter was Indian or white.

"He was white," I said. "Fully white?" a soldier asked
and I told him that Sam the Indian might be the last

fully good white man in America. "The dead guy ain't Feeder
or Breeder," shouted the soldier. Sam wasn't needed

because the scientists couldn't use his bone marrow
so the soldiers left Sam's body to the crows and sparrows.

"What am I?" I asked the soldier as he tied my hands behind
my back with soft cotton twine, but he did not reply.

"What am I?" I asked the soldier as they carried
me to the helicopter. "Are you single or married?"

asked a soldier. "I'm a bag of bones," I said.
"Do you have any children," the soldier asked again

and again, but I kept telling him I was all alone
in this new world, that I was just a bag of bones.



2. Sam the Indian
When the blades fell upon me
I was closer to being Indian than I had ever been before.
When the blades fell upon me
I was closer to being Indian than I had ever been before.
When the blades fell upon me
I was closer to being Indian than I had ever been before.
When the blades fell upon me
I was closer to being Indian than I had ever been before.
When the blades fell upon me
I was closer to being Indian than I had ever been before.
When the blades fell upon me

When the blades fell upon me
I was closer to being Indian than I had ever been before.



3. Charlie the Cook
After we were captured by the soldiers, they took all of the Indians to a place called the Farm. My history became their history. They took notes. They tattooed my forehead with a B for Breeder, because I was young and pure-blood. They keep the Breeder men and women together. In each cell, there are five women and one man. We are rotated often, never allowed to develop relationships. We are not allowed to talk. We are never in the same cell with a member of the same tribe. Bright lights wake us at 6 A.M. We eat breakfast only after we procreate. I'm supposed to have sex with five Indian women a day. I have fathered dozens of children since this all started. Half of my children became Breeders and stayed at the Farm, while the other half became Feeders and were sent to the Kitchen. The Feeders have it much worse than the Breeders. The Feeders have their marrow taken from them. They are hooked up to machines that suck it out. Sometimes they survive. Sometimes they die. It happens to children, too. There is no age limit. When they need the marrow, they take it. There's constant demand. Each cancer patient needs a year's worth of Steptoe 123. Late at night, in the cell, I reach my hand out into the dark and I feel another hand reaching out for mine. I cannot see who I touch. We cannot speak. But we hold each other's hands lightly, ready to release our grips at any moment.



4. Agnes the Waitress
When the Indian men come to me
I try to smile.

I lift my tunic
and part my legs

with as much honor
as I can manage.

I try to love the Indian men
who are forced to enter me.

It would be easy to hate them.
Some women do.

Some women refuse
to acknowledge the man's body.

Some women close their eyes 
and imagine a new childhood.

Some women weep constantly.
They don't last long.

But I hold the men close
and kiss their necks.

That always surprises them.
They stare at me

and I wonder if 
I am beautiful.

I have forgotten
what that means.

I cannot tell the difference
between a beautiful man

and an ugly man
because it makes no difference.

We do not have the luxury
of such a decision.

We are Indian
and that is all that matters

though it is rumored
that white guards sneak

into bed with Indian women.
I have heard the rustling

of blankets late at night
when Indian women crawled

into bed with Indian women.
An Indian woman once kissed me

and I felt her hands on my breasts.
I reached for her, too

but the guard rushed in
and took her away.

I never saw her again.
I dream about her

though I cannot tell you
if she was beautiful.

I want to believe
my babies are beautiful

though I have learned to let them go.
I give birth.

I heal.
I am pregnant again.

Pregnancy is the good time.
Pregnant women share a cell.

We eat well.
We are not touched.

We are allowed to speak
to the body inside our own

and pretend it is our mother,
father, sister, and brother.



5. Charlie the Cook
We have developed a highly complex and subtle sign language. Through slight gestures, such as brushing the hair from our faces, we can talk about the past. The volume of a cough can change the tense of a sentence. A woman can sit up in bed, scratch her cheek, stand quickly, shuffle across the room to a water fountain, take a big drink, swallow loudly, and we'd all know she was telling a joke. Indians always find a way to laugh, though each of us laugh in a different way. I laugh by crossing my arms. I cry by tapping my left foot against the floor.

I try to find the soldiers beneath their masks.
I try to find the doctors behind their sorrow.

The white people never thought to ask
if we would voluntarily donate the marrow.



7. Jonah
We've been planning the revolution for years.
We have weapons and white friends, but I fear

Indians have forgotten how to survive.
It's a complicated song and dance. Late at night

we practice. We pound invisible drums. We sing
with our mouths closed. Silence is the thing

we must learn to fear. This is the plan.
One night, we will slip from our beds and stand

together. We will stamp our feet in unison
and sing the same song loudly with strong lungs

and hearts. We will sing the old songs.
Cousins, this is not where we belong.

Way, ya, hi, yo. Way, ya, hi, yo.< 
Way, ya, hi, yo. Way, ya, hi, yo.

Cousins, remember how we sang and danced back then.
During the revolution, we will find our music again.

9. Charlie the Cook
I have not seen a black man in years. Not a black woman. Not a Mexican man, though their blood is often mixed with Indians, too. I have not seen another Indian man. I have seen only white men and Indian women. There are rumors. The Indian women have refused to procreate, and instead, they are killing the Indian men. It would be easy. In each cell, five women to each man. There are rumors. Indian men are becoming sterile. We have fathered too many children. There are rumors. The revolution is about to begin. Indians will rise against our jailers. We will never touch each other again. We will allow ourselves to die as a people, rather than live as we do now. There are rumors. A large army of sympathetic outsiders, white, black, brown, and yellow, are preparing to storm the Farm. They will free us. There are rumors. All of the cancer is gone. It has been completely destroyed. Our jailers will soon open the doors and let us free. They will give us medals of honor as we leave.

 

 

Defending Walt Whitman

Basketball is like this for young Indian boys, all arms and legs
and serious stomach muscles. Every body is brown!
These are the twentieth-century warriors who will never kill,
although a few sat quietly in the deserts of Kuwait,
waiting for orders to do something, to do something.

God, there is nothing as beautiful as a jumpshot
on a reservation summer basketball court
where the ball is moist with sweat,
and makes a sound when it swishes through the net
that causes Walt Whitman to weep because it is so perfect.

There are veterans of foreign wars here
although their bodies are still dominated
by collarbones and knees, although their bodies still respond
in the ways that bodies are supposed to respond when we are young.
Every body is brown! Look there, that boy can run
up and down this court forever. He can leap for a rebound
with his back arched like a salmon, all meat and bone
synchronized, magnetic, as if the court were a river,
as if the rim were a dam, as if the air were a ladder
leading the Indian boy toward home.

Some of the Indian boys still wear their military hair cuts
while a few have let their hair grow back.
It will never be the same as it was before!
One Indian boy has never cut his hair, not once, and he braids it
into wild patterns that do not measure anything.
He is just a boy with too much time on his hands.
Look at him. He wants to play this game in bare feet.

God, the sun is so bright! There is no place like this.
Walt Whitman stretches his calf muscles
on the sidelines. He has the next game.
His huge beard is ridiculous on the reservation.
Some body throws a crazy pass and Walt Whitman catches it
with quick hands. He brings the ball close to his nose
and breathes in all of its smells: leather, brown skin, sweat,
black hair, burning oil, twisted ankle, long drink of warm water,
gunpowder, pine tree. Walt Whitman squeezes the ball tightly.
He wants to run. He hardly has the patience to wait for his turn.
"What's the score?" he asks. He asks, "What's the score?"

Basketball is like this for Walt Whitman. He watches these Indian boys
as if they were the last bodies on earth. Every body is brown!
Walt Whitman shakes because he believes in God.
Walt Whitman dreams of the Indian boy who will defend him,
trapping him in the corner, all flailing arms and legs
and legendary stomach muscles. Walt Whitman shakes
because he believes in God. Walt Whitman dreams
of the first jumpshot he will take, the ball arcing clumsily
from his fingers, striking the rim so hard that it sparks.
Walt Whitman shakes because he believes in God.
Walt Whitman closes his eyes. He is a small man and his beard
is ludicrous on the reservation, absolutely insane.
His beard makes the Indian boys righteously laugh. His beard
frightens the smallest Indian boys. His beard tickles the skin
of the Indian boys who dribble past him. His beard, his beard!

God, there is beauty in every body. Walt Whitman stands
at center court while the Indian boys run from basket to basket.
Walt Whitman cannot tell the difference between
offense and defense. He does not care if he touches the ball.
Half of the Indian boys wear t-shirts damp with sweat
and the other half are bareback, skin slick and shiny.
There is no place like this. Walt Whitman smiles.
Walt Whitman shakes. This game belongs to him.

 

 
The Powwow at the End of the World


I am told by many of you that I must forgive and so I shall
after an Indian woman puts her shoulder to the Grand Coulee Dam
and topples it. I am told by many of you that I must forgive
and so I shall after the floodwaters burst each successive dam
downriver from the Grand Coulee. I am told by many of you
that I must forgive and so I shall after the floodwaters find
their way to the mouth of the Columbia River as it enters the Pacific
and causes all of it to rise. I am told by many of you that I must forgive
and so I shall after the first drop of floodwater is swallowed by that salmon
waiting in the Pacific. I am told by many of you that I must forgive and so I shall
after that salmon swims upstream, through the mouth of the Columbia
and then past the flooded cities, broken dams and abandoned reactors
of Hanford. I am told by many of you that I must forgive and so I shall
after that salmon swims through the mouth of the Spokane River
as it meets the Columbia, then upstream, until it arrives
in the shallows of a secret bay on the reservation where I wait alone.
I am told by many of you that I must forgive and so I shall after
that salmon leaps into the night air above the water, throws
a lightning bolt at the brush near my feet, and starts the fire
which will lead all of the lost Indians home. I am told
by many of you that I must forgive and so I shall
after we Indians have gathered around the fire with that salmon
who has three stories it must tell before sunrise: one story will teach us
how to pray; another story will make us laugh for hours;
the third story will give us reason to dance. I am told by many
of you that I must forgive and so I shall when I am dancing
with my tribe during the powwow at the end of the world.

Superman and Me 

I learned to read with a Superman comic book. Simple enough, I suppose. I cannot recall which particular Superman comic book I read, nor can I remember which villain he fought in that issue. I cannot remember the plot, nor the means by which I obtained the comic book. What I can remember is this: I was 3 years old, a Spokane Indian boy living with his family on the Spokane Indian Reservation in eastern Washington state. We were poor by most standards, but one of my parents usually managed to find some minimum-wage job or another, which made us middle-class by reservation standards. I had a brother and three sisters. We lived on a combination of irregular paychecks, hope, fear and government surplus food.

My father, who is one of the few Indians who went to Catholic school on purpose, was an avid reader of westerns, spy thrillers, murder mysteries, gangster epics, basketball player biographies and anything else he could find. He bought his books by the pound at Dutch's Pawn Shop, Goodwill, Salvation Army and Value Village. When he had extra money, he bought new novels at supermarkets, convenience stores and hospital gift shops. Our house was filled with books. They were stacked in crazy piles in the bathroom, bedrooms and living room. In a fit of unemployment-inspired creative energy, my father built a set of bookshelves and soon filled them with a random assortment of books about the Kennedy assassination, Watergate, the Vietnam War and the entire 23-book series of the Apache westerns. My father loved books, and since I loved my father with an aching devotion, I decided to love books as well.

I can remember picking up my father's books before I could read. The words themselves were mostly foreign, but I still remember the exact moment when I first understood, with a sudden clarity, the purpose of a paragraph. I didn't have the vocabulary to say "paragraph," but I realized that a paragraph was a fence that held words. The words inside a paragraph worked together for a common purpose. They had some specific reason for being inside the same fence. This knowledge delighted me. I began to think of everything in terms of paragraphs. Our reservation was a small paragraph within the United States. My family's house was a paragraph, distinct from the other paragraphs of the LeBrets to the north, the Fords to our south and the Tribal School to the west. Inside our house, each family member existed as a separate paragraph but still had genetics and common experiences to link us. Now, using this logic, I can see my changed family as an essay of seven paragraphs: mother, father, older brother, the deceased sister, my younger twin sisters and our adopted little brother.

At the same time I was seeing the world in paragraphs, I also picked up that Superman comic book. Each panel, complete with picture, dialogue and narrative was a three-dimensional paragraph. In one panel, Superman breaks through a door. His suit is red, blue and yellow. The brown door shatters into many pieces. I look at the narrative above the picture. I cannot read the words, but I assume it tells me that "Superman is breaking down the door." Aloud, I pretend to read the words and say, "Superman is breaking down the door." Words, dialogue, also float out of Superman's mouth. Because he is breaking down the door, I assume he says, "I am breaking down the door." Once again, I pretend to read the words and say aloud, "I am breaking down the door" In this way, I learned to read.

This might be an interesting story all by itself. A little Indian boy teaches himself to read at an early age and advances quickly. He reads "Grapes of Wrath" in kindergarten when other children are struggling through "Dick and Jane." If he'd been anything but an Indian boy living on the reservation, he might have been called a prodigy. But he is an Indian boy living on the reservation and is simply an oddity. He grows into a man who often speaks of his childhood in the third-person, as if it will somehow dull the pain and make him sound more modest about his talents.


A smart Indian is a dangerous person, widely feared and ridiculed by Indians and non-Indians alike. I fought with my classmates on a daily basis. They wanted me to stay quiet when the non-Indian teacher asked for answers, for volunteers, for help. We were Indian children who were expected to be stupid. Most lived up to those expectations inside the classroom but subverted them on the outside. They struggled with basic reading in school but could remember how to sing a few dozen powwow songs. They were monosyllabic in front of their non-Indian teachers but could tell complicated stories and jokes at the dinner table. They submissively ducked their heads when confronted by a non-Indian adult but would slug it out with the Indian bully who was 10 years older. As Indian children, we were expected to fail in the non-Indian world. Those who failed were ceremonially accepted by other Indians and appropriately pitied by non-Indians.

I refused to fail. I was smart. I was arrogant. I was lucky. I read books late into the night, until I could barely keep my eyes open. I read books at recess, then during lunch, and in the few minutes left after I had finished my classroom assignments. I read books in the car when my family traveled to powwows or basketball games. In shopping malls, I ran to the bookstores and read bits and pieces of as many books as I could. I read the books my father brought home from the pawnshops and secondhand. I read the books I borrowed from the library. I read the backs of cereal boxes. I read the newspaper. I read the bulletins posted on the walls of the school, the clinic, the tribal offices, the post office. I read junk mail. I read auto-repair manuals. I read magazines. I read anything that had words and paragraphs. I read with equal parts joy and desperation. I loved those books, but I also knew that love had only one purpose. I was trying to save my life.

Despite all the books I read, I am still surprised I became a writer. I was going to be a pediatrician. These days, I write novels, short stories, and poems. I visit schools and teach creative writing to Indian kids. In all my years in the reservation school system, I was never taught how to write poetry, short stories or novels. I was certainly never taught that Indians wrote poetry, short stories and novels. Writing was something beyond Indians. I cannot recall a single time that a guest teacher visited the reservation. There must have been visiting teachers. Who were they? Where are they now? Do they exist? I visit the schools as often as possible. The Indian kids crowd the classroom. Many are writing their own poems, short stories and novels. They have read my books. They have read many other books. They look at me with bright eyes and arrogant wonder. They are trying to save their lives. Then there are the sullen and already defeated Indian kids who sit in the back rows and ignore me with theatrical precision. The pages of their notebooks are empty. They carry neither pencil nor pen. They stare out the window. They refuse and resist. "Books," I say to them. "Books," I say. I throw my weight against their locked doors. The door holds. I am smart. I am arrogant. I am lucky. I am trying to save our lives.
 

 

I Hated Tonto (Still Do) 

I was a little Spokane Indian boy who read every book and saw every movie about Indians, no matter how terrible. I'd read those historical romance novels about the stereotypical Indian warrior ravaging the virginal white schoolteacher.

I can still see the cover art.

The handsome, blue-eyed warrior (the Indians in romance novels are always blue-eyed because half-breeds are somehow sexier than full-blooded Indians) would be nuzzling (the Indians in romance novels are always performing acts that are described in animalistic terms) the impossibly pale neck of a white woman as she reared her head back in primitive ecstasy (the Indians in romance novels always inspire white women to commit acts of primitive ecstasy).

Of course, after reading such novels, I imagined myself to be a blue-eyed warrior nuzzling the necks of various random, primitive and ecstatic white women.

And I just as often imagined myself to be a cinematic Indian, splattered with Day-Glo Hollywood war paint as I rode off into yet another battle against the latest actor to portray Gen. George Armstrong Custer.

But I never, not once, imagined myself to be Tonto.

I hated Tonto then and I hate him now.

However, despite my hatred of Tonto, I loved movies about Indians, loved them beyond all reasoning and saw no fault with any of them.

I loved John Ford's "The Searchers."

I rooted for John Wayne as he searched for his niece for years and years. I rooted for John Wayne even though I knew he was going to kill his niece because she had been "soiled" by the Indians. Hell, I rooted for John Wayne because I understood why he wanted to kill his niece.

I hated those savage Indians just as much as John Wayne did.



In the movies, Indians are always accompanied by ominous music. And I've seen so many Indian movies that I feel like I'm constantly accompanied by ominous music. I always feel that something bad is about to happen.

I am always aware of how my whole life is shaped by my hatred of Tonto. Whenever I think of Tonto, I hear ominous music.

I walk into shopping malls or family restaurants, as the ominous music drops a few octaves, and imagine that I am Billy Jack, the half-breed Indian and Vietnam vet turned flower-power pacifist (now there's a combination) who loses his temper now and again, takes off his shoes (while his opponents patiently wait for him to do so), and then kicks the red out of the necks of a few dozen racist white extras.

You have to remember Billy Jack, right?

Every Indian remembers Billy Jack. I mean, back in the day, Indians worshipped Billy Jack.

Whenever a new Billy Jack movie opened in Spokane, my entire tribe would climb into two or three vans like so many circus clowns and drive to the East Trent Drive-In for a long evening of greasy popcorn, flat soda pop, fossilized licorice rope and interracial violence.

We Indians cheered as Billy Jack fought for us, for every single Indian.

Of course, we conveniently ignored the fact that Tom Laughlin, the actor who played Billy Jack, was definitely not Indian.

After all, such luminary white actors as Charles Bronson, Chuck Connors, Burt Reynolds, Burt Lancaster, Sal Mineo, Anthony Quinn and Charlton Heston had already portrayed Indians, so who were we to argue?

I mean, Tom Laughlin did have a nice tan and he spoke in monosyllables and wore cowboy boots and a jean jacket just like Indians. And he did have a Cherokee grandmother or grandfather or butcher, so he was Indian by proximity, and that was good enough in 1972, when disco music was about to rear its ugly head and bell-bottom pants were just beginning to change the shape of our legs.

When it came to the movies, Indians had learned to be happy with less.

We didn't mind that cinematic Indians never had jobs.

We didn't mind that cinematic Indians were deadly serious.

We didn't mind that cinematic Indians were rarely played by Indian actors.

We made up excuses.

"Well, that Tom Laughlin may not be Indian, but he sure should be."

"Well, that movie wasn't so good, but Sal Mineo looked sort of like Uncle Stubby when he was still living out on the reservation."

"Well, I hear Burt Reynolds is a little bit Cherokee. Look at his cheekbones. He's got them Indian cheekbones."

"Well, it's better than nothing."

Yes, that became our battle cry.

"Sometimes, it's a good day to die. Sometimes, it's better than nothing."

We Indians became so numb to the possibility of dissent, so accepting of our own lowered expectations, that we canonized a film like "Powwow Highway."

When it was first released, I loved "Powwow Highway." I cried when I first saw it in the theater, then cried again when I stayed and watched it again a second time.

I mean, I loved that movie. I memorized whole passages of dialogue. But recently, I watched the film for the first time in many years and cringed in shame and embarrassment with every stereotypical scene.

I cringed when Philbert Bono climbed to the top of a sacred mountain and left a Hershey chocolate bar as an offering.

I cringed when Philbert and Buddy Red Bow waded into a stream and sang Indian songs to the moon.

I cringed when Buddy had a vision of himself as an Indian warrior throwing a tomahawk through the window of a police cruiser.

I mean, I don't know a single Indian who would leave a chocolate bar as an offering. I don't know any Indians who have ever climbed to the top of any mountain. I don't know any Indians who wade into streams and sing to the moon. I don't know of any Indians who imagine themselves to be Indian warriors.
Wait—

I was wrong. I know of at least one Indian boy who always imagined himself to be a cinematic Indian warrior.

Me.

I watched the movies and saw the kind of Indian I was supposed to be.

A cinematic Indian is supposed to climb mountains.

I am afraid of heights.

A cinematic Indian is supposed to wade into streams and sing songs.

I don't know how to swim.

A cinematic Indian is supposed to be a warrior.

I haven't been in a fistfight since sixth grade and she beat the crap out of me.

I mean, I knew I could never be as brave, as strong, as wiser as visionary, as white as the Indians in the movies.

I was just one little Indian boy who hated Tonto because Tonto was the only cinematic Indian who looked like me.




 

Ellen West 

I love sweets,—
                              heaven
would be dying on a bed of vanilla ice cream . . .
 
But my true self
is thin, all profile
 
and effortless gestures, the sort of blond
elegant girl whose
                                body is the image of her soul.
 
—My doctors tell me I must give up
this ideal;
                 but I
WILL NOT . . . cannot.
 
Only to my husband I'm not simply a "case."
 
But he is a fool. He married
meat, and thought it was a wife.
 
* * *
 
Why am I a girl?
 
I ask my doctors, and they tell me they
don't know, that it is just "given."
 
But it has such
implications—;
                            and sometimes,
I even feel like a girl.
 
* * *
 
Now, at the beginning of Ellen's thirty-second year, her
physical condition has deteriorated still further. Her use
of laxatives increases beyond measure. Every evening she
takes sixty to seventy tablets of a laxative, with the result
that she suffers tortured vomiting at night and violent
diarrhea by day, often accompanied by a weakness of the
heart. She has thinned down to a skeleton, and weighs
only 92 pounds.

About five years ago, I was in a restaurant,
eating alone
                           with a book. I was
not married, and often did that . . .
 
—I'd turn down
dinner invitations, so I could eat alone;
 
I'd allow myself two pieces of bread, with
butter, at the beginning, and three scoops of
vanilla ice cream, at the end,—
 
                                                     sitting there alone
 
with a book, both in the book
and out of it, waited on, idly
watching people,—
 
                                    when an attractive young man
and woman, both elegantly dressed,
sat next to me.
 
                            She was beautiful—;
 
with sharp, clear features, a good
bone structure—;
                               if she took her make-up off
in front of you, rubbing cold cream
again and again across her skin, she still would be
beautiful—
                   more beautiful.
 
And he,—
                   I couldn't remember when I had seen a man
so attractive. I didn't know why. He was almost
 
a male version
                             of her,—
 
I had the sudden, mad notion that I
wanted to be his lover . . .
 
—Were they married?
                                      were they lovers?
 
They didn't wear wedding rings.
 
Their behavior was circumspect. They discussed
politics. They didn't touch . . .
 
—How could I discover?
 
                                                Then, when the first course
arrived, I noticed the way
 
each held his fork out for the other
 
to taste what he had ordered . . .
 
                                                                 They did this
again and again, with pleased looks, indulgent
smiles, for each course,
                                     more than once for each dish—;
much too much for just friends . . .
 
—Their behavior somehow sickened me;
 
the way each gladly
put the food the other had offered into his mouth—;
 
I knew what they were. I knew they slept together.
 
An immense depression came over me . . .
 
—I knew I could never
with such ease allow another to put food into my mouth:
 
happily myself put food into another's mouth—;
 
I knew that to become a wife I would have to give up my ideal.
 
* * *
 
Even as a child,
I saw that the "natural" process of aging
 
is for one's middle to thicken—
one's skin to blotch;
 
as happened to my mother.
And her mother.
                            I loathed "Nature."
 
At twelve, pancakes
became the most terrible thought there is. . .
 
I shall defeat "Nature."
 
In the hospital, when they
weigh me, I wear weights secretly sewn into my belt.

January 16. The patient is allowed to eat in her room, but comes
readily with her husband to afternoon coffee. Previously she had
stoutly resisted this on the ground that she did not really eat but
devoured like a wild animal. This she demonstrated with utmost
realism . . . . Her physical examination showed nothing striking.
Salivary-glands are markedly enlarged on both sides.
January 21. Has been reading Faust again. In her diary,
writes that art is the "mutual permeation" of the "world of the
body" and the "world of the spirit." Says that her own poems
are "hospital poems . . . weak—without skill or perseverance;
only managing to beat their wings softly."
February 8. Agitation, quickly subsided again. Has
attached herself to an elegant, very thin female patient. Homo-
erotic component strikingly evident.
February 15. Vexation, and torment. Says that her mind
forces her always to think of eating. Feels herself degraded by
this. Has entirely, for the first time in years, stopped writing poetry.

Callas is my favorite singer, but I've only
seen her once—;
 
I've never forgotten that night. . .
 
—It was in Tosca, she had long before
lost weight, her voice
had been, for years,
                                  deteriorating, half itself. . .
 
When her career began, of course, she was fat,
 
enormous—; in the early photographs,
sometimes I almost don't recognize her. . .
 
The voice too then was enormous—
 
healthy; robust; subtle; but capable of
crude effects, even vulgar,
                                             almost out of
high spirits, too much health. . .
 
But soon she felt that she must lose weight,—
that all she was trying to express
 
was obliterated by her body,
buried in flesh—;
                               abruptly, within
four months, she lost at least sixty pounds. . .
 
—The gossip in Milan was that Callas
had swallowed a tapeworm.
 
But of course she hadn't.
 
                                            The tapeworm
was her soul. . .
 
—How her soul, uncompromising,
insatiable,
                    must have loved eating the flesh from her bones,
 
revealing this extraordinarily
mercurial; fragile; masterly creature. . .
 
—But irresistibly, nothing
stopped there; the huge voice
 
also began to change: at first, it simply diminished
in volume, in size,
                                  then the top notes became
shrill, unreliable—at last,
usually not there at all. . .
 
—No one knows why. Perhaps her mind,
ravenous, still insatiable, sensed
 
that to struggle with the shreds of a voice
 
must make her artistry subtler, more refined,
more capable of expressing humiliation,
rage, betrayal. . .
 
—Perhaps the opposite. Perhaps her spirit
loathed the unending struggle
 
to embody itself, to manifest itself, on a stage whose
 
mechanics, and suffocating customs,
seemed expressly designed to annihilate spirit. . .
 
—I know that in Tosca, in the second act,
when, humiliated, hounded by Scarpia,
she sang Vissi d'arte
                                      —"I lived for art"—
 
and in torment, bewilderment, at the end she asks,
with a voice reaching
                                      harrowingly for the notes,
 
"Art has repaid me LIKE THIS?"
 
                                                           I felt I was watching
autobiography—
                              an art; skill;
virtuosity
 
miles distant from the usual soprano's
athleticism,—
                         the usual musician's dream
of virtuosity without content. . .
 
—I wonder what she feels, now,
listening to her recordings.
 
For they have already, within a few years,
begun to date. . .
 
Whatever they express
they express through the style of a decade
and a half—;
                         a style she helped create. . .
 
—She must know that now
she probably would not do a trill in
exactly that way,—
                                   that the whole sound, atmosphere,
dramaturgy of her recordings
 
have just slightly become those of the past. . .
 
—Is it bitter? Does her soul
tell her
 
that she was an idiot ever to think
anything
                material wholly could satisfy?. . .
 
—Perhaps it says: The only way
to escape
the History of Styles
 
is not to have a body.
 
* * *
 
When I open my eyes in the morning, my great
mystery
             stands before me . . .
 
—I know that I am intelligent; therefore
 
the inability not to fear food
day-and-night; this unending hunger
ten minutes after I have eaten . . .
                                                          a childish
dread of eating; hunger which can have no cause,—
 
half my mind says that all this
is demeaning . . .
 
                                 Bread
 
for days on end
drives all real thought from my brain . . .
 
—Then I think, No. The ideal of being thin
 
conceals the ideal
not to have a body—;
                                     which is NOT trivial . . .
 
This wish seems now as much a "given" of my existence
 
as the intolerable
fact that I am dark-complexioned; big-boned;
and once weighed
one hundred and sixty-five pounds . . .
 
—But then I think, No. That's too simple,—
 
without a body, who can
know himself at all?
                                   Only by
acting; choosing; rejecting; have I
made myself—
                         discovered who and what Ellen can be . . .
 
—But then again I think, NO. This I is anterior
 
to name; gender; action;
fashion;
                MATTER ITSELF,—
 
. . . trying to stop my hunger with FOOD
is like trying to appease thirst
                                                   with ink.

March 30. Result of the consultation: Both gentlemen agree
completely with my prognosis and doubt any therapeutic
usefulness of commitment even more emphatically than I.
All three of us are agreed that it is not a case of obsessional
neurosis and not one of manic-depressive psychosis, and that
no definitely reliable therapy is possible. We therefore resolved
to give in to the patient's demand for discharge.

The train-ride yesterday
was far worse than I expected . . .
 
                                                         In our compartment
 
were ordinary people: a student;
a woman; her child;—
 
they had ordinary bodies, pleasant faces;
                                                                            but I thought
 
I was surrounded by creatures
 
with the pathetic, desperate
desire to be not what they were:—
 
the student was short,
and carried his body as if forcing
it to be taller—;
 
the woman showed her gums when she smiled,
and often held her
hand up to hide them—;
 
the child
seemed to cry simply because it was
small; a dwarf, and helpless . . .
 
—I was hungry. I had insisted that my husband
not bring food . . .
 
After about thirty minutes, the woman
peeled an orange
 
to quiet the child. She put a section
into its mouth—;
                               immediately it spit it out.
 
The piece fell to the floor.
 
—She pushed it with her foot through the dirt
toward me
several inches.
 
My husband saw me staring
down at the piece . . .
 
—I didn't move; how I wanted
to reach out,
                        and as if invisible
 
shove it in my mouth—;
 
my body
became rigid. As I stared at him,
I could see him staring
 
at me,—
                then he looked at the student—; at the woman—; then
back to me . . .
 
I didn't move.
 
—At last, he bent down, and
casually
               threw it out the window.
 
He looked away.
 
—I got up to leave the compartment, then
saw his face,—
 
his eyes
were red;
                and I saw
 
—I'm sure I saw—
 
disappointment.
 
* * *
 
At breakfast she eats butter and sugar, at noon she eats
so much that—for the first time in thirteen years!—she is
satisfied by her food and gets really full. At afternoon
coffee she eats chocolate creams and Easter eggs. She
takes a walk with her husband, reads poems, listens to
recordings, is in a positively festive mood, and all heavi-
ness seems to have fallen away from her. She writes
letters, the last one a letter to the fellow patient here to
whom she had become so attached. In the evening she
takes a lethal dose of poison, and on the following morn-
ing she is dead. "She looked as she had never looked in
life—calm and happy and peaceful."
 
* * *
 
Dearest.—I remember how
at eighteen,
                     on hikes with friends, when
they rested, sitting down to joke or talk,
 
I circled
around them, afraid to hike ahead alone,
 
yet afraid to rest
when I was not yet truly thin.
 
You and, yes, my husband,—
you and he
 
have by degrees drawn me within the circle;
forced me to sit down at last on the ground.
 
I am grateful.
 
But something in me refuses it.
 
—How eager I have been
to compromise, to kill this refuser,—
 
but each compromise, each attempt
to poison an ideal
which often seemed to me sterile and unreal,
 
heightens my hunger.
 
I am crippled. I disappoint you.
 
Will you greet with anger, or
happiness,
 
the news which might well reach you
before this letter?
 
Your Ellen.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Herbert White 
"When I hit her on the head, it was good,

and then I did it to her a couple of times,--
but it was funny,--afterwards,
it was as if somebody else did it ...

Everything flat, without sharpness, richness or line.

Still, I liked to drive past the woods where she lay,
tell the old lady and the kids I had to take a piss,
hop out and do it to her ...

The whole buggy of them waiting for me
made me feel good;
but still, just like I knew all along,
she didn't move.

When the body got too discomposed,
I'd just jack off, letting it fall on her ...

--It sounds crazy, but I tell you
sometimes it was beautiful--; I don't know how
to say it, but for a minute, everything was possible--;
and then,
then,--
well, like I said, she didn't move: and I saw,
under me, a little girl was just lying there in the mud:

and I knew I couldn't have done that,--
somebody else had to have done that,--
standing above her there,
in those ordinary, shitty leaves ...

--One time, I went to see Dad in a motel where he was
staying with a woman; but she was gone;
you could smell the wine in the air; and he started,
real embarrassing, to cry ...
He was still a little drunk,
and asked me to forgive him for
all he hasn't done--; but, What the shit?
Who would have wanted to stay with Mom? with bastards
not even his own kids?

I got in the truck, and started to drive
and saw a little girl--
who I picked up, hit on the head, and
screwed, and screwed, and screwed, and screwed, then

buried,
in the garden of the motel ...

--You see, ever since I was a kid I wanted
to feel things make sense: I remember

looking out the window of my room back home,--
and being almost suffocated by the asphalt;
and grass; and trees; and glass;
just there, just there, doing nothing!
not saying anything! filling me up--
but also being a wall; dead, and stopping me;
--how I wanted to see beneath it, cut

beneath it, and make it
somehow, come alive ...

The salt of the earth;
Mom once said, 'Man's spunk is the salt of the earth ...'

--That night, at that Twenty-nine Palms Motel
I had passed a million times on the road, everything

fit together; was alright;
it seemed like
everything had to be there, like I had spent years
trying, and at last finally finished drawing this
huge circle ...

--But then, suddenly I knew
somebody else did it, some bastard
had hurt a little girl--; the motel
I could see again, it had been
itself all the time, a lousy
pile of bricks, plaster, that didn't seem to
have to be there,--but was, just by chance ...

--Once, on the farm, when I was a kid,
I was screwing a goat; and the rope around his neck
when he tried to get away
pulled tight;--and just when I came,
he died ...
I came back the next day; jacked off over his body;
but it didn't do any good ...

Mom once said:
'Man's spunk is the salt of the earth, and grows kids.'

I tried so hard to come; more pain than anything else;
but didn't do any good ...

--About six months ago, I heard Dad remarried,
so I drove over to Connecticut to see him and see
if he was happy.
She was twenty-five years younger than him:
she had lots of little kids, and I don't know why,
I felt shaky ...

I stopped in front of the address; and
snuck up to the window to look in ...
--There he was, a kid
six months old on his lap, laughing
and bouncing the kid, happy in his old age
to play the papa after years of sleeping around,--
it twisted me up ...
To think that what he wouldn't give me,
he wanted to give them ...

I could have killed the bastard ...

--Naturally, I just got right back in the car,
and believe me, was determined, determined,
to head straight for home ...

but the more I drove,
I kept thinking about getting a girl,
and the more I thought I shouldn't do it,
the more I had to--

I saw her coming out of the movies,
saw she was alone, and
kept circling the blocks as she walked along them,
saying, 'You're going to leave her alone.'
'You're going to leave her alone.'

--The woods were scary!
As the seasons changed, and you saw more and more
of the skull show through, the nights became clearer,
and the buds,--erect, like nipples ...

--But then, one night,
nothing worked ...
Nothing in the sky
would blur like I wanted it to;
and I couldn't, couldn't,
get it to seem to me
that somebody else did it ...

I tried, and tried, but there was just me there,
and her, and the sharp trees
saying, "That's you standing there.
You're ...
just you."

I hope I fry.

--Hell came when I saw
MYSELF ...
and couldn't stand
what I see ..." 




The Fish
 
I caught a tremendous fish
and held him beside the boat
half out of water, with my hook
fast in a corner of his mouth.
He didn't fight.
He hadn't fought at all.
He hung a grunting weight,
battered and venerable
and homely.  Here and there
his brown skin hung in strips
like ancient wallpaper,
and its pattern of darker brown 
was like wallpaper:
shapes like full-blown roses
stained and lost through age.
He was speckled with barnacles,
fine rosettes of lime,
and infested
with tiny white sea-lice,
and underneath two or three
rags of green weed hung down.
While his gills were breathing in
the terrible oxygen
—the frightening gills,
fresh and crisp with blood,
that can cut so badly—
I thought of the coarse white flesh
packed in like feathers,
the big bones and the little bones,
the dramatic reds and blacks
of his shiny entrails,
and the pink swim-bladder
like a big peony.
I looked into his eyes
which were far larger than mine
but shallower, and yellowed,
the irises backed and packed 
with tarnished tinfoil
seen through the lenses
of old scratched isinglass.
They shifted a little, but not
to return my stare.
—It was more like the tipping 
of an object toward the light.
I admired his sullen face,
the mechanism of his jaw,
and then I saw
that from his lower lip
—if you could call it a lip 
grim, wet, and weaponlike,
hung five old pieces of fish-line,
or four and a wire leader
with the swivel still attached,
with all their five big hooks
grown firmly in his mouth.
A green line, frayed at the end
where he broke it, two heavier lines, 
and a fine black thread
still crimped from the strain and snap 
when it broke and he got away.
Like medals with their ribbons 
frayed and wavering,
a five-haired beard of wisdom
trailing from his aching jaw.
I stared and stared
and victory filled up
the little rented boat,
from the pool of bilge
where oil had spread a rainbow
around the rusted engine
to the bailer rusted orange,
the sun-cracked thwarts,
the oarlocks on their strings, 
the gunnels—until everything
was rainbow, rainbow, rainbow!
And I let the fish go.
 
 
Sandpiper
 
The roaring alongside he takes for granted,
and that every so often the world is bound to shake.
He runs, he runs to the south, finical, awkward,
in a state of controlled panic, a student of Blake.
 
The beach hisses like fat. On his left, a sheet
of interrupting water comes and goes
and glazes over his dark and brittle feet.
He runs, he runs straight through it, watching his toes.
 
—Watching, rather, the spaces of sand between them
where (no detail too small) the Atlantic drains
rapidly backwards and downwards. As he runs,
he stares at the dragging grains.
 
The world is a mist. And then the world is
minute and vast and clear. The tide
is higher or lower. He couldn't tell you which.
His beak is focussed; he is preoccupied,
 
looking for something, something, something.
Poor bird, he is obsessed!
The millions of grains are black, white, tan, and gray
mixed with quartz grains, rose and amethyst. 
 
 
The Imaginary Iceberg
 
We'd rather have the iceberg than the ship, 
although it meant the end of travel. 
Although it stood stock-still like cloudy rock 
and all the sea were moving marble. 
We'd rather have the iceberg than the ship; 
we'd rather own this breathing plain of snow 
though the ship's sails were laid upon the sea 
as the snow lies undissolved upon the water. 
O solemn, floating field, 
are you aware an iceberg takes repose 
with you, and when it wakes may pasture on your snows? 
 
This is a scene a sailor'd give his eyes for. 
The ship's ignored. The iceberg rises 
and sinks again; its glassy pinnacles 
correct elliptics in the sky. 
This is a scene where he who treads the boards 
is artlessly rhetorical. The curtain 
is light enough to rise on finest ropes 
that airy twists of snow provide. 
The wits of these white peaks 
spar with the sun. Its weight the iceberg dares 
upon a shifting stage and stands and stares. 
 
The iceberg cuts its facets from within. 
Like jewelry from a grave 
it saves itself perpetually and adorns 
only itself, perhaps the snows 
which so surprise us lying on the sea. 
Good-bye, we say, good-bye, the ship steers off 
where waves give in to one another's waves 
and clouds run in a warmer sky. 
Icebergs behoove the soul 
(both being self-made from elements least visible) 
to see them so: fleshed, fair, erected indivisible. 
 
 
Giant Snail
 
The rain has stopped. The waterfall will roar like that all night. I have come out to take a walk and feed. My body—foot, that is—is wet and cold and covered with sharp gravel. It is white, the size of a dinner plate. I have set myself a goal, a certain rock, but it may well be dawn before I get there. Although I move ghostlike and my floating edges barely graze the ground, I am heavy, heavy, heavy. My white muscles are already tired. I give the impression of mysterious ease, but it is only with the greatest effort of my will that I can rise above the smallest stones and sticks. And I must not let myself be distracted by those rough spears of grass. Don't touch them. Draw back. Withdrawal is always best.
 
The rain has stopped. The waterfall makes such a noise! (And what if I fall over it?) The mountains of black rock give off such clouds of steam! Shiny streamers are hanging down their sides. When this occurs, we have a saying that the Snail Gods have come down in haste. I could never descend such steep escarpments, much less dream of climbing them.
 
That toad was too big, too, like me. His eyes beseeched my love. Our proportions horrify our neighbors.
 
Rest a minute; relax. Flattened to the ground, my body is like a pallid, decomposing leaf. What's that tapping on my shell? Nothing. Let's go on.
 
My sides move in rhythmic waves, just off the ground, from front to back, the wake of a ship, wax-white water, or a slowly melting floe. I am cold, cold, cold as ice. My blind, white bull's head was a Cretan scare-head; degenerate, my four horns that can't attack. The sides of my mouth are now my hands. They press the earth and suck it hard. Ah, but I know my shell is beautiful, and high, and glazed, and shining. I know it well, although I have not seen it. Its curled white lip is of the finest enamel. Inside, it is as smooth as silk, and I, I fill it to perfection.
 
My wide wake shines, now it is growing dark. I leave a lovely opalescent ribbon: I know this.
 
But O! I am too big. I feel it. Pity me.
 
If and when I reach the rock, I shall go into a certain crack there for the night. The waterfall below will vibrate through my shell and body all night long. In that steady pulsing I can rest. All night I shall be like a sleeping ear.
 
    
Giant Toad

I am too big. Too big by far. Pity me. 

My eyes bulge and hurt. They are my one great beauty, even so. They see too much, above, 
below. And yet, there is not much to see. The rain has stopped. The mist is gathering on 
my skin in drops. The drops run down down my sides and drip beneath my belly. Perhaps 
the droplets on my mottled hide are pretty, like dewdrops, silver on a moldering leaf? 
They chill me through and through. I feel my colors changing now, my pigments gradually 
shudder and shift over. 

Now I shall get beneath that overhanging ledge. Slowly. Hop. Two or three times more, 
silently. That was too far. I'm standing up. The lichen's gray, and rough to my front feet. 
Get down. Turn facing out, it's safer. Don't breathe until the snail gets by. But we go 
travelling the same weathers. 

Swallow the air and mouthfuls of cold mist. Give voice, just once. O how it echoed from 
the rock! What a profound, angelic bell I rang! 

I live, I breathe, by swallowing. Once, some naughty children picked me up, me and 
two brothers. They set us down again somewhere and in our mouths they put lit cigarettes. 
We could not help but smoke them, to the end. I thought it was the death of me, but when 
I was entirely filled with smoke, when my slack mouth was burning, and all my tripes 
were and dry, they let us go. But I was sick for days. 

I have big shoulders, like a boxer. They are not muscle, however, and their color is dark. 
They are my sacs of poison, the almost unused poison that I bear, my burden and my 
great responsibility. Big wings of poison, folded on my back. Beware, I am an angel 
in disguise; my wings are evil, but not deadly. If I will it, the poison could break through, 
blue-black,and dangerous to all. Blue-black fumes would rise upon the air. Beware, 
you frivolous crab. 
 
12 O'Clock News

As you all know, tonight is the night of the full
moon, half the world over. But here the moon
seems to hang motionless in the sky. It gives very
little light; it could be dead. Visibility is poor.
Nevertheless, we shall try to give you some idea of
the lay of the land and the present situation.

The escapement that rises abruptly from the central
plain is in heavy shadow, but the elaborate terrac-
ing of its southern glacis gleams faintly in the dim
light, like fish scales. What endless labor those
small, peculiarly shaped terraces represent! And
yet, on them the welfare of this tiny principality
depends. 

pile of mss.

A slight landslide occurred in the northwest about
an hour ago. The exposed soil appears to be of poor
quality: almost white, calcareous, and shaly. There
are believed to have been no casualties.

Almost due north, our aerial reconnaissance reports
the discovery of a large rectangular ‘field’, hitherto
unknown to us, obviously man-made. It is dark-
speckled. An airstrip? A cemetery? 

envelopes

In this small, backward country, one of the most
backward left in the world today, communications
are crude and “industrialization” and its products
almost nonexistent. Strange to say, however, sign-
boards are on a truly gigantic scale. 

ink-bottle

We have also received reports of a mysterious, oddly
shaped, black structure, at an undisclosed distance
to the east. Its presence was revealed only because
its highly polished surface catches such feeble
moonlight as prevails. The natural resources of the
country being far from completely known to us,
there is the possibility that this may be, or may
contain, some powerful and terrifying “secret
weapon”. On the other hand, given what we do
know, or have learned from our anthropologists
and sociologists about this people, it may well be
nothing more than a numen, or a great altar
recently erected to one of their gods, to which, in
their present historical state of superstition and
helplessness, they attribute magical power, and
may even regard as a “savior,” one last hope of
rescue from their grave difficulties.

At last! One of the elusive natives has been spotted!
He appears to be—rather, to have been—a
unicyclist-courier, who may have met his end by
falling from the height of the escarpment because
of the deceptive illumination. Alive, he would have
been small, but undoubtedly proud and erect, with
the thick, bristling black hair typical of the
indigenes.

From our superior vantage point, we can clearly see
into a sort of dugout, possibly a shell crater, a “nest”
of soldiers. They lie heaped together, wearing the
camouflage “battle dress” intended for “winter war-
fare”. They are in hideously contorted position, all
dead. We can make out at least eight bodies. These
uniforms were designed to be used in guerilla
warfare on the country's one snow-covered moun-
tain peak. The fact that these poor soldiers are
wearing them here, on the plain, gives further
proof, if proof were necessary, either of the childish-
ness and hopeless impracticality of this inscrutable
people, our opponents, or of the sad corruption of their
leaders.

 

 

The Map
 
Land lies in water; it is shadowed green.
Shadows, or are they shallows, at its edges
showing the line of long sea-weeded ledges
where weeds hang to the simple blue from green.
Or does the land lean down to lift the sea from under,
drawing it unperturbed around itself?
Along the fine tan sandy shelf
is the land tugging at the sea from under?
 
The shadow of Newfoundland lies flat and still.
Labrador's yellow, where the moony Eskimo
has oiled it. We can stroke these lovely bays,
under a glass as if they were expected to blossom,
or as if to provide a clean cage for invisible fish.
The names of seashore towns run out to sea,
the names of cities cross the neighboring mountains
—the printer here experiencing the same excitement
as when emotion too far exceeds its cause.
These peninsulas take the water between thumb and finger
like women feeling for the smoothness of yard-goods.
 
Mapped waters are more quiet than the land is,
lending the land their waves' own conformation:
and Norway's hare runs south in agitation,
profiles investigate the sea, where land is.
Are they assigned, or can the countries pick their colors?
—What suits the character or the native waters best.
Topography displays no favorites; North's as near as West.
More delicate than the historians' are the map-makers' colors. 
 
 
 
The Man-Moth
 
Man-Moth: Newspaper misprint for "mammoth."
      
          Here, above,
cracks in the buldings are filled with battered moonlight.
The whole shadow of Man is only as big as his hat.
It lies at his feet like a circle for a doll to stand on,
and he makes an inverted pin, the point magnetized to the moon.
He does not see the moon; he observes only her vast properties,
feeling the queer light on his hands, neither warm nor cold,
of a temperature impossible to records in thermometers.
 
          But when the Man-Moth
pays his rare, although occasional, visits to the surface,
the moon looks rather different to him.  He emerges
from an opening under the edge of one of the sidewalks
and nervously begins to scale the faces of the buildings.
He thinks the moon is a small hole at the top of the sky,
proving the sky quite useless for protection.
He trembles, but must investigate as high as he can climb.
 
          Up the façades,
his shadow dragging like a photographer's cloth behind him
he climbs fearfully, thinking that this time he will manage
to push his small head through that round clean opening
and be forced through, as from a tube, in black scrolls on the light.
(Man, standing below him, has no such illusions.)
But what the Man-Moth fears most he must do, although 
he fails, of course, and falls back scared but quite unhurt.
 
          Then he returns
to the pale subways of cement he calls his home. He flits,
he flutters, and cannot get aboard the silent trains
fast enough to suit him.  The doors close swiftly.
The Man-Moth always seats himself facing the wrong way
and the train starts at once at its full, terrible speed, 
without a shift in gears or a gradation of any sort.
He cannot tell the rate at which he travels backwards.
 
          Each night he must
be carried through artificial tunnels and dream recurrent dreams.
Just as the ties recur beneath his train, these underlie
his rushing brain.  He does not dare look out the window,
for the third rail, the unbroken draught of poison,
runs there beside him. He regards it as a disease
he has inherited the susceptibility to.  He has to keep 
his hands in his pockets, as others must wear mufflers.
 
          If you catch him,
hold up a flashlight to his eye.  It's all dark pupil,
an entire night itself, whose haired horizon tightens
as he stares back, and closes up the eye.  Then from the lids 
one tear, his only possession, like the bee's sting, slips.
Slyly he palms it, and if you're not paying attention
he'll swallow it.  However, if you watch, he'll hand it over,
cool as from underground springs and pure enough to drink.
 
 
In the Waiting Room
 
In Worcester, Massachusetts,
I went with Aunt Consuelo
to keep her dentist's appointment
and sat and waited for her
in the dentist's waiting room.
It was winter. It got dark
early. The waiting room
was full of grown-up people,
arctics and overcoats,
lamps and magazines.
My aunt was inside
what seemed like a long time
and while I waited I read
the National Geographic 
(I could read) and carefully 
studied the photographs:
the inside of a volcano,
black, and full of ashes;
then it was spilling over
in rivulets of fire.
Osa and Martin Johnson 
dressed in riding breeches,
laced boots, and pith helmets.
A dead man slung on a pole
—"Long Pig," the caption said.
Babies with pointed heads
wound round and round with string;
black, naked women with necks
wound round and round with wire
like the necks of light bulbs.
Their breasts were horrifying.
I read it right straight through.
I was too shy to stop.
And then I looked at the cover:
the yellow margins, the date.
Suddenly, from inside,
came an oh! of pain
—Aunt Consuelo's voice—
not very loud or long.
I wasn't at all surprised;
even then I knew she was 
a foolish, timid woman.
I might have been embarrassed,
but wasn't.  What took me
completely by surprise
was that it was me:
my voice, in my mouth.
Without thinking at all
I was my foolish aunt,
I—we—were falling, falling,
our eyes glued to the cover
of the National Geographic,
February, 1918.
 
I said to myself: three days
and you'll be seven years old.
I was saying it to stop
the sensation of falling off
the round, turning world.
into cold, blue-black space.
But I felt: you are an I,
you are an Elizabeth,
you are one of them.
Why should you be one, too?
I scarcely dared to look
to see what it was I was.
I gave a sidelong glance
—I couldn't look any higher—
at shadowy gray knees,
trousers and skirts and boots
and different pairs of hands
lying under the lamps.
I knew that nothing stranger
had ever happened, that nothing
stranger could ever happen.
 
Why should I be my aunt,
or me, or anyone?
What similarities—
boots, hands, the family voice
I felt in my throat, or even
the National Geographic
and those awful hanging breasts--
held us all together
or made us all just one?
How--I didn't know any
word for it--how "unlikely". . .
How had I come to be here,
like them, and overhear
a cry of pain that could have
got loud and worse but hadn't?
 
The waiting room was bright
and too hot. It was sliding
beneath a big black wave,
another, and another.
 
Then I was back in it.
The War was on. Outside,
in Worcester, Massachusetts,
were night and slush and cold,
and it was still the fifth 
of February, 1918.
 
 
First Death in Nova Scotia
 
In the cold, cold parlor
my mother laid out Arthur
beneath the chromographs:
Edward, Prince of Wales,
with Princess Alexandra,
and King George with Queen Mary.
Below them on the table
stood a stuffed loon
shot and stuffed by Uncle
Arthur, Arthur's father.
 
Since Uncle Arthur fired
a bullet into him,
he hadn't said a word.
He kept his own counsel
on his white, frozen lake,
the marble-topped table.
His breast was deep and white,
cold and caressable;
his eyes were red glass,
much to be desired.
 
"Come," said my mother,
"Come and say good-bye
to your little cousin Arthur."
I was lifted up and given
one lily of the valley
to put in Arthur's hand.
Arthur's coffin was
a little frosted cake,
and the red-eyed loon eyed it
from his white, frozen lake.
 
Arthur was very small.
He was all white, like a doll
that hadn't been painted yet.
Jack Frost had started to paint him
the way he always painted
the Maple Leaf (Forever).
He had just begun on his hair,
a few red strokes, and then
Jack Frost had dropped the brush
and left him white, forever.
 
The gracious royal couples
were warm in red and ermine;
their feet were well wrapped up
in the ladies' ermine trains.
They invited Arthur to be
the smallest page at court.
But how could Arthur go,
clutching his tiny lily,
with his eyes shut up so tight
and the roads deep in snow? 
 
Sestina

September rain falls on the house. 
In the failing light, the old grandmother 
sits in the kitchen with the child 
beside the Little Marvel Stove, 
reading the jokes from the almanac, 
laughing and talking to hide her tears.

She thinks that her equinoctial tears 
and the rain that beats on the roof of the house 
were both foretold by the almanac, 
but only known to a grandmother. 
The iron kettle sings on the stove. 
She cuts some bread and says to the child,

It's time for tea now; but the child 
is watching the teakettle's small hard tears 
dance like mad on the hot black stove, 
the way the rain must dance on the house. 
Tidying up, the old grandmother 
hangs up the clever almanac

on its string.  Birdlike, the almanac 
hovers half open above the child, 
hovers above the old grandmother 
and her teacup full of dark brown tears. 
She shivers and says she thinks the house 
feels chilly, and puts more wood in the stove.

It was to be, says the Marvel Stove. 
I know what I know, says the almanac. 
With crayons the child draws a rigid house 
and a winding pathway.  Then the child 
puts in a man with buttons like tears 
and shows it proudly to the grandmother.

But secretly, while the grandmother 
busies herself about the stove, 
the little moons falls down like tears 
from between the pages of the almanac 
into the flower bed the child 
has carefully placed in the front of the house.

Time to plant tears, says the almanac. 
The grandmother sings to the marvelous stove 
and the child draws another inscrutable house.

 

 

A Miracle for Breakfast

At six o'clock we were waiting for coffee, 
waiting for coffee and the charitable crumb 
that was going to be served from a certain balcony 
--like kings of old, or like a miracle. 
It was still dark. One foot of the sun 
steadied itself on a long ripple in the river. 

The first ferry of the day had just crossed the river. 
It was so cold we hoped that the coffee 
would be very hot, seeing that the sun 
was not going to warm us; and that the crumb 
would be a loaf each, buttered, by a miracle. 
At seven a man stepped out on the balcony. 

He stood for a minute alone on the balcony 
looking over our heads toward the river. 
A servant handed him the makings of a miracle, 
consisting of one lone cup of coffee 
and one roll, which he proceeded to crumb, 
his head, so to speak, in the clouds--along with the sun. 

Was the man crazy? What under the sun 
was he trying to do, up there on his balcony! 
Each man received one rather hard crumb, 
which some flicked scornfully into the river, 
and, in a cup, one drop of the coffee. 
Some of us stood around, waiting for the miracle. 

I can tell what I saw next; it was not a miracle. 
A beautiful villa stood in the sun 
and from its doors came the smell of hot coffee. 
In front, a baroque white plaster balcony 
added by birds, who nest along the river, 
--I saw it with one eye close to the crumb-- 

and galleries and marble chambers. My crumb 
my mansion, made for me by a miracle, 
through ages, by insects, birds, and the river 
working the stone. Every day, in the sun, 
at breakfast time I sit on my balcony 
with my feet up, and drink gallons of coffee. 

We licked up the crumb and swallowed the coffee. 
A window across the river caught the sun 
as if the miracle were working, on the wrong balcony.

 

Questions of Travel

There are too many waterfalls here; the crowded streams 
hurry too rapidly down to the sea, 
and the pressure of so many clouds on the mountaintops 
makes them spill over the sides in soft slow-motion, 
turning to waterfalls under our very eyes. 
--For if those streaks, those mile-long, shiny, tearstains, 
aren't waterfalls yet, 
in a quick age or so, as ages go here, 
they probably will be. 
But if the streams and clouds keep travelling, travelling, 
the mountains look like the hulls of capsized ships, 
slime-hung and barnacled. 

Think of the long trip home. 
Should we have stayed at home and thought of here? 
Where should we be today? 
Is it right to be watching strangers in a play 
in this strangest of theatres? 
What childishness is it that while there's a breath of life 
in our bodies, we are determined to rush 
to see the sun the other way around? 
The tiniest green hummingbird in the world? 
To stare at some inexplicable old stonework, 
inexplicable and impenetrable, 
at any view, 
instantly seen and always, always delightful? 
Oh, must we dream our dreams 
and have them, too? 
And have we room 
for one more folded sunset, still quite warm? 

But surely it would have been a pity 
not to have seen the trees along this road, 
really exaggerated in their beauty, 
not to have seen them gesturing 
like noble pantomimists, robed in pink. 
--Not to have had to stop for gas and heard 
the sad, two-noted, wooden tune 
of disparate wooden clogs 
carelessly clacking over 
a grease-stained filling-station floor. 
(In another country the clogs would all be tested. 
Each pair there would have identical pitch.) 
--A pity not to have heard 
the other, less primitive music of the fat brown bird 
who sings above the broken gasoline pump 
in a bamboo church of Jesuit baroque: 
three towers, five silver crosses. 
--Yes, a pity not to have pondered, 
blurr'dly and inconclusively, 
on what connection can exist for centuries 
between the crudest wooden footwear 
and, careful and finicky, 
the whittled fantasies of wooden footwear 
and, careful and finicky, 
the whittled fantasies of wooden cages. 
--Never to have studied history in 
the weak calligraphy of songbirds' cages. 
--And never to have had to listen to rain 
so much like politicians' speeches: 
two hours of unrelenting oratory 
and then a sudden golden silence 
in which the traveller takes a notebook, writes: 

"Is it lack of imagination that makes us come 
to imagined places, not just stay at home? 
Or could Pascal have been not entirely right 
about just sitting quietly in one's room? 

Continent, city, country, society: 
the choice is never wide and never free. 
And here, or there . . . No. Should we have stayed at home, 
wherever that may be?"

 

Song for the Rainy Season

Hidden, oh hidden 
in the high fog 
the house we live in, 
beneath the magnetic rock, 
rain-, rainbow-ridden, 
where blood-black 
bromelias, lichens, 
owls, and the lint 
of the waterfalls cling, 
familiar, unbidden. 

In a dim age 
of water 
the brook sings loud 
from a rib cage 
of giant fern; vapor 
climbs up the thick growth 
effortlessly, turns back, 
holding them both, 
house and rock, 
in a private cloud. 

At night, on the roof, 
blind drops crawl 
and the ordinary brown 
owl gives us proof 
he can count: 
five times--always five-- 
he stamps and takes off 
after the fat frogs that, 
shrilling for love, 
clamber and mount. 

House, open house 
to the white dew 
and the milk-white sunrise 
kind to the eyes, 
to membership 
of silver fish, mouse, 
bookworms, 
big moths; with a wall 
for the mildew's 
ignorant map; 

darkened and tarnished 
by the warm touch 
of the warm breath, 
maculate, cherished; 
rejoice! For a later 
era will differ. 
(O difference that kills 
or intimidates, much 
of all our small shadowy 
life!) Without water 

the great rock will stare 
unmagnetized, bare, 
no longer wearing 
rainbows or rain, 
the forgiving air 
and the high fog gone; 
the owls will move on 
and the several 
waterfalls shrivel 
in the steady sun. 

 

Filling Stations

Oh, but it is dirty!
--this little filling station,
oil-soaked, oil-permeated
to a disturbing, over-all
Be careful with that match!

Father wears a dirty,
oil-soaked monkey suit
that cuts him under the arms,
and several quick and saucy
and greasy sons assist him
(it's a family filling station),
all quite thoroughly dirty.

Do they live in the station?
It has a cement porch
behind the pumps, and on it
a set of crushed and grease-
impregnated wickerwork;
on the wicker sofa
a dirty dog, quite comfy.

Some comic books provide
the only note of color--
of certain color. They lie
upon a big dim doily
draping a taboret
(part of the set), beside
a big hirsute begonia.

Why the extraneous plant?
Why the taboret?
Why, oh why, the doily?
(Embroidered in daisy stitch
with marguerites, I think,
and heavy with gray crochet.)

Somebody embroidered the doily.
Somebody waters the plant,
or oils it, maybe. Somebody
arranges the rows of cans
so that they softly say:
ESSO--SO--SO--SO

to high-strung automobiles.
Somebody loves us all.


In the Waiting Room
 
In Worcester, Massachusetts,
I went with Aunt Consuelo
to keep her dentist's appointment
and sat and waited for her
in the dentist's waiting room.
It was winter. It got dark
early. The waiting room
was full of grown-up people,
arctics and overcoats,
lamps and magazines.
My aunt was inside
what seemed like a long time
and while I waited I read
the National Geographic 
(I could read) and carefully 
studied the photographs:
the inside of a volcano,
black, and full of ashes;
then it was spilling over
in rivulets of fire.
Osa and Martin Johnson 
dressed in riding breeches,
laced boots, and pith helmets.
A dead man slung on a pole
—"Long Pig," the caption said.
Babies with pointed heads
wound round and round with string;
black, naked women with necks
wound round and round with wire
like the necks of light bulbs.
Their breasts were horrifying.
I read it right straight through.
I was too shy to stop.
And then I looked at the cover:
the yellow margins, the date.
Suddenly, from inside,
came an oh! of pain
—Aunt Consuelo's voice—
not very loud or long.
I wasn't at all surprised;
even then I knew she was 
a foolish, timid woman.
I might have been embarrassed,
but wasn't.  What took me

Number 20 (froom A Coney Island of the Mind)

        The pennycandystore beyond the El
       is where I first
                       fell in love
                                   with unreality
       Jellybeans glowed in the semi-gloom
       of that september afternoon
       A cat upon the counter moved among
                                 the licorice sticks
                      and tootsie rolls
              and Oh Boy Gum

       Outside the leaves were falling as they died

       A wind had blown away the sun

       A girl ran in 
       Her hair was rainy
       Her breasts were breathless in the little room

       Outside the leaves were falling
                            and they cried
                                         Too soon!  too soon!

Ode to My Socks 
 

Maru Mori brought me 
a pair 
of socks 
which she knitted herself 
with her sheepherder's hands, 
two socks as soft as rabbits. 
I slipped my feet 
into them 
as though into 
two 
cases 
knitted 
with threads of 
twilight 
and goatskin. 
Violent socks, 
my feet were 
two fish made 
of wool, 
two long sharks 
sea-blue, shot 
through 
by one golden thread, 
two immense blackbirds, 
two cannons: 
my feet 
were honored 
in this way 
by 
these 
heavenly 
socks. 
They were 
so handsome 
for the first time 
my feet seemed to me 
unacceptable 
like two decrepit 
firemen, firemen 
unworthy 
of that woven 
fire, 
of those glowing 
socks.

Nevertheless 
I resisted 
the sharp temptation 
to save them somewhere 
as schoolboys 
keep 
fireflies, 
as learned men 
collect 
sacred texts, 
I resisted 
the mad impulse 
to put them 
into a golden 
cage 
and each day give them 
birdseed 
and pieces of pink melon. 
Like exploreres 
in the jungle who hand 
over the very rare 
green deer 
to the spit 
and eat it 
with remorse, 
I stretched out 
my feet 
and pulled on 
the magnificent 
socks 
and then my shoes.

The moral 
of my ode is this: 
beauty is twice 
beauty 
and what is good is doubly 
good 
when it is a matter of two socks 
made of wool 
in winter.

  
 

Ode to Salt

This salt 
in the saltcellar 
I once saw in the salt mines. 
I know 
you won't 
believe me, 
but 
it sings, 
salt sings, the skin 
of the salt mines, 
sings 
with a mouth smothered 
by the earth. 
I shivered in those 
solitudes 
when I heard 
the voice 
of 
the salt 
in the desert. 
Near Antofagasta 
the nitrous 
pampa 
resounds: 
a 
broken 
voice, 
a mournful 
song.

In its caves 
the salt moans, mountain 
of buried light, 
crystal of the sea, oblivion 
of the waves.

And then on every table 
in the world, 
salt, 
we see your piquant 
powder 
sprinkling 
vital light 
upon 
our food. 
Preserver 
of the ancient 
holds of ships, 
discoverer 
on 
the high seas, 
earliest 
sailor 
of the unknown, shifting 
byways of the foam. 
Dust of the sea, in you 
the tongue receives a kiss 
from ocean night: 
taste imparts to every seasoned 
dish your ocean essence; 
the smallest 
miniature 
wave from the saltcellar 
reveals to us 
more than domestic whitenesss; 
in it, we taste infinitude.

 

Ode to the Watermelon

The tree of intense 
summer, 
hard, 
is all blue sky, 
yellow sun, fatigue in drops, 
a sword 
above the highways, 
a scorched shoe 
in the cities: 
the brightness and the world 
weigh us down, 
hit us 
in the eyes 
with clouds of dust, 
with sudden golden blows, 
they torture 
our feet 
with tiny thorns, 
with hot stones, 
and the mouth 
suffers 
more than all the toes: 
the throat 
becomes thirsty, 
the teeth, 
the lips, the tongue: 
we want to drink 
waterfalls, 
the dark blue night, 
the South Pole, 
and then 
the coolest of all 
the planets crosses 
the sky, 
the round, magnificent, 
star-filled watermelon.

It's a fruit from the thirst-tree. 
It's the green whale of the summer.

The dry universe 
all at once 
given dark stars 
by this firmament of coolness 
lets the swelling 
fruit 
come down: 
its hemispheres open 
showing a flag 
green, white, red, 
that dissolves into 
wild rivers, sugar, 
delight!

Jewel box of water, phlegmatic 
queen 
of the fruitshops, 
warehouse 
of profundity, moon 
on earth! 
You are pure, 
rubies fall apart 
in your abundance, 
and we 
want 
to bite into you, 
to bury our 
face 
in you, and 
our hair, and 
the soul! 
When we're thirsty 
we glimpse you 
like 
a mine or a mountain 
of fantastic food, 
but 
among our longings and our teeth 
you change 
simply 
into cool light 
that slips in turn into 
spring water 
that touched us once 
singing. 
And that is why 
you don't weigh us down 
in the siesta hour 
that's like an oven, 
you don't weigh us down, 
you just 
go by 
and your heart, some cold ember, 
turned itself into a single 
drop of water.

 

America, I Do Not Call Your Name without Hope

America, I do not call your name without hope. 
When I hold the sword against the heart, 
when I live with the faulty roof in the soul, 
when one of your new days 
pierces me coming through the windows, 
I am and I stand in the light that produces me, 
I live in the darkness which makes me what I am, 
I sleep and awake in your fundamental sunrise: 
as mild as the grapes, and as terrible, 
carrier of sugar and the whip, 
soaked in the sperm of your species, 
nursed on the blood of your inheritance.

 

Body of a Woman

Body of a woman, white hills, white thighs, 
you like a world, lying in surrentder. 
My rough peasant's body digs in you 
and makes the son leap from the depth of the earth.

I was alone like a tunnel.  The birds fled from me, 
and night swamped me with its crushing invasion. 
To survive myself I forged you like a weapon, 
like an arrow in my bow, a stone in my sling.

But the hour of vengeance falls, and I love you. 
Body of skin, of moss, of eager and firm milk. 
Oh the goblets of the breast!  Oh the eyes of absence! 
Oh the roses of the publis!  Oh your voice, slow and sad!

Body of my woman, I will persist in your grace. 
My thirst, my boundless desire, my shifting road! 
Dark river-beds where the eternal thirst flows 
and weariness follows, and the infinite ache.

 

Walking Around

It so happens I'm tired of just being a man. 
I go to a movie, drop in at the tailor's--it so happens-- 
feeling wizened and numbed, like a big, wooly swan, 
awash on an ocean of clinkers and causes.

A whiff from a barbershop does it; I yell bloody murder. 
All I ask is a little vacation from things:  from boulders and woolens, 
from gardens, institutional projects, merchandise, 
eyeglasses, elevators--I'd rather not look at them.

It so happens I'm fed up--with my feet and my fingernails 
and my hair and my shadow. 
Being a man leaves me cold:  that's how it is.

Still—it would be lovely 
to wave a cut lily and panic a notary, 
or finish a nun with a left to the ear. 
It would be nice 
just to walk down the street with a green switchblade handy, 
whooping it up till I die of the shivers.

I won't live like this—like a root in a shadow, 
wide-open and wondering, teeth chattering sleepily, 
going down to the dripping entrails of the universe 
absorbing things, talking things in, eating three squares a day.

I've had all I'll take from catastrophe. 
I won't have it this way, muddling through like a root or a grave, 
all alone underground, in a morgue of cadavers, 
cold as a stiff, dying of misery.

That's why Monday flares up like an oil-slick, 
when it sees me up close, with the face of a jailbird, 
or squeaks like a broken-down wheel as it goes, 
stepping hot-blooded into the night.

Something shoves me toward certain damp houses, into certain dark corners, 
into hospitals, with bones flying out of the windows; 
into shoe stores and shoemakers smelling of vinegar, 
streets frightful as fissures laid open.

There, trussed to the doors of the houses I loathe 
are the sulphurous birds, in a horror of tripes, 
dental plates lost in a coffeepot, mirrors 
that must surely have wept with the nightmare and shame of it all; 
and everywhere, poisons, umbrellas, and belly buttons.

I stroll unabashed, in my eyes and my shoes 
and my rage and oblivion. 
I go on, crossing offices, retail orthopedics, 
courtyards with laundry hung out on a wire; 
the blouses and towels and the drawers newly washed, 
slowly dribbling a slovenly tear.


 


It so happens I am sick of being a man. 
And it happens that I walk into tailorshops and movie houses 
dried up, waterproof, like a swan made of felt 
steering my way in a water of wombs and ashes.

The smell of barbershops makes me break into hoarse sobs. 
The only thing I want is to lie still like stones or wool. 
The only thing I want is to see no more stores, no gardens, 
no more goods, no spectacles, no elevators.

It so happens I am sick of my feet and my nails 
and my hair and my shadow. 
It so happens I am sick of being a man.

Still it would be marvelous 
to terrify a law clerk with a cut lilly, 
or kill a nun with a blow on the ear. 
It would be great 
to go through the streets with a green knife 
letting out yells until I died of the cold.

I don't want to go on being a root in the dark, 
insecure, stretched out, shivering with sleep, 
going on down, into the moist guts of the earth, 
taking in and thinking, eating every day.

I don't want so much misery. 
I don't want to go on as a root and a tomb, 
alone under the ground, a warehouse with corpses, 
half frozen, dying of grief.

That's why Monday, when it sees me coming 
with my convict face, blazes up like gasoline, 
and it howls on its way like a wounded wheel, 
and leaves tracks full of warm blood leading toward the night.

And it pushes me into certain corners, into some moist houses, 
into hospitals where the bones fly out the window, 
into shoeshops that smell like vinegar, 
and certain streets hideous as cracks in the skin.

There are sulpher-colored birds, and hideous intestines 
hanging over the doors of houses that I hate, 
and there are false teeth forgotten in a coffeepot, 
there are mirrors 
that ought to have wept from shame and terror, 
there are umbrellas everywhere, and venoms, and umbilical cords.

I stroll along serenely, with my eyes, my shoes, 
my rage, forgetting everything, 
I walk by, going through the office buildings and orthopedic shops, 
and courtyards with washing hanging from the line: 
underwear, towels and shirts from which slow 
dirty tears are falling.

 


It happens that I am tired of being a man. 
It happens that I go into the tailor's shops and the movies 
all shrivelled up, impenetrable, like a felt swan 
navigating on a water of origin and ash.

The smell of barber shops makes me sob out loud. 
I want nothing but the repose either of stone or of wool. 
I want to see no more establishments, no more gardens, 
nor merchandise, nor glasses, nor elevators.

It happens that I am tired of my feet and my nails 
and my hair and my shadow. 
It happens that I am tired of being a man.

Just the same it would be delicious 
to scare a notary with a cut lily 
or knock a nun stone dead with one blow of an ear. 
It would be beautiful 
to go through the streets with a green knife 
shouting until I died of cold.

I do not want to go on being a root in the dark, 
hesitating, stretched out, shivering with dreams, 
downwards, in the wet tripe of the earth, 
soaking it up and thinking, eating every day.

I do not want to be the inheritor of so many misfortunes. 
I do not want to continue as a root and as a tomb, 
as a solitary tunnel, as a cellar full of corpses, 
stiff with cold, dying with pain.

For this reason Monday burns like oil 
at the sight of me arriving with my jail-face, 
and it howls in passing like a wounded wheel, 
and its footsteps towards nightfall are filled with hot blood.

And it shoves me along to certain corners, to certain damp houses, 
to hospitals where the bones come out of the windows, 
to certain cobbler's shops smelling of vinegar, 
to streets horrendous as crevices.

There are birds the colour of sulphur, and horrible intestines 
hanging from the doors of the houses which I hate, 
there are forgotten sets of teeth in a coffee-pot, 
there are mirrors 
which should have wept with shame and horror, 
there are umbrellas all over the place, and poisons, and navels.

I stride along with calm, with eyes, with shoes, 
with fury, with forgetfuless, 
I pass, I cross offices and stores full of orthopedic appliances, 
and courtyards hung with clothes on wires, 
underpants, towels and shirts which weep 
slow dirty tears.

 

And How Long?

How much does a man live, after all?

Does he live a thousand days, or one only?

For a week, or for several centuries?

How long does a man spend dying?

What does it mean to say 'for ever'?

Lost in this preoccupation, 
I set myself to clear things up.

I sought out knowledgable priests, 
I waited for them after their rituals, 
I watched them when they went their ways 
to visit God and the Devil.

They wearied of my questions. 
They on their part knew very little. 
They were no more than administrators.

Medical men received me 
in between consultations, 
a scalpel in each hand, 
saturated in aureomycin, 
busier each day. 
As far as I could tell from their talk, 
the problem was as follows: 
it was not so much the death of a microbe-- 
they went down by the ton, 
but the few which survived 
showed signs of perversity.

They left me so startled 
that I sought out the grave-diggers. 
I went to the rivers where they burn 
enormous painted corpses, 
tiny bony bodies, 
emperors with an aura 
of terrible curses, 
women snuffed out at a stroke 
by a wave of cholera. 
There were whole beaches of dead 
and ashy specialists.

When I got the chance 
I asked them a slew of questions. 
They offered to burn me. 
It was all they knew.

In my own country the dead 
answered me, between drinks: 
'Get yourself a good woman 
and give up this nonsense.'

I never saw people so happy.

Raising their glasses they sang 
toasting health and death. 
They were huge fornicators.

I returned home, much older 
after crossing the world.

Now I ask questions of nobody,

But I know less every day. 
  
 

Tonight I Can Write

Tonight I can write the saddest lines.

Write, for example, 'The night is starry
and the stars are blue and shiver in the distance.'

The night wind revolves in the sky and sings.

Tonight I can write the saddest lines.
I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.

Through nights like this one I held her in my arms.
I kissed her again and again under the endless sky.

She loved me, sometimes I loved her too.
How could one not have loved her great still eyes.

Tonight I can write the saddest lines.
To think that I do not have her. To feel that I have lost her.

To hear the immense night, still more immense without her.
And the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture.

What does it matter that my love could not keep her.
The night is starry and she is not with me.

This is all. In the distance someone is singing. In the distance.
My soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.

My sight tries to find her as though to bring her closer.
My heart looks for her, and she is not with me.

The same night whitening the same trees.
We, of that time, are no longer the same.

I no longer love her, that's certain, but how I loved her.
My voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing.

Another's. She will be another's. As she was before my kisses.
Her voice, her bright body. Her infinite eyes.

I no longer love her, that's certain, but maybe I love her.
Love is so short, forgetting is so long.

Because through nights like this one I held her in my arms
my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.

Though this be the last pain that she makes me suffer
and these the last verses that I write for her.


Ode To The Lemon
From blossoms
released
by the moonlight,
from an
aroma of exasperated
love,
steeped in fragrance,
yellowness
drifted from the lemon tree,
and from its plantarium
lemons descended to the earth.

Tender yield!
The coasts,
the markets glowed
with light, with
unrefined gold;
we opened
two halves
of a miracle,
congealed acid
trickled
from the hemispheres
of a star,
the most intense liqueur
of nature,
unique, vivid,
concentrated,
born of the cool, fresh
lemon,
of its fragrant house,
its acid, secret symmetry.

Knives
sliced a small
cathedral
in the lemon,
the concealed apse, opened,
revealed acid stained glass,
drops
oozed topaz,
altars,
cool architecture.

So, when you hold
the hemisphere
of a cut lemon
above your plate,
you spill
a universe of gold,
a
yellow goblet
of miracles,
a fragrant nipple
of the earth's breast,
a ray of light that was made fruit,
the minute fire of a planet.


Shirt

The back, the yoke, the yardage. Lapped seams,
The nearly invisible stitches along the collar
Turned in a sweatshop by Koreans or Malaysians

Gossiping over tea and noodles on their break
Or talking money or politics while one fitted
This armpiece with its overseam to the band

Of cuff I button at my wrist. The presser, the cutter,
The wringer, the mangle. The needle, the union,
The treadle, the bobbin. The code. The infamous blaze

At the Triangle Factory in nineteen-eleven.
One hundred and forty-six died in the flames
On the ninth floor, no hydrants, no fire escapes—

The witness in a building across the street
Who watched how a young man helped a girl to step
Up to the windowsill, then held her out

Away from the masonry wall and let her drop.
And then another. As if he were helping them up
To enter a streetcar, and not eternity.

A third before he dropped her put her arms
Around his neck and kissed him. Then he held
Her into space, and dropped her. Almost at once

He stepped up to the sill himself, his jacket flared
And fluttered up from his shirt as he came down,
Air filling up the legs of his gray trousers—

Like Hart Crane's Bedlamite, "shrill shirt ballooning."
Wonderful how the pattern matches perfectly
Across the placket and over the twin bar-tacked

Corners of both pockets, like a strict rhyme
Or a major chord. Prints, plaids, checks,
Houndstooth, Tattersall, Madras. The clan tartans

Invented by mill-owners inspired by the hoax of Ossian,
To control their savage Scottish workers, tamed
By a fabricated heraldry: MacGregor,

Bailey, MacMartin. The kilt, devised for workers
to wear among the dusty clattering looms.
Weavers, carders, spinners. The loader,

The docker, the navvy. The planter, the picker, the sorter
Sweating at her machine in a litter of cotton
As slaves in calico headrags sweated in fields:

George Herbert, your descendant is a Black
Lady in South Carolina, her name is Irma
And she inspected my shirt. Its color and fit

And feel and its clean smell have satisfied
both her and me. We have culled its cost and quality
Down to the buttons of simulated bone,

The buttonholes, the sizing, the facing, the characters
Printed in black on neckband and tail. The shape,
The label, the labor, the color, the shade. The shirt.

 
The Pleasures of the Door

 

 

Kings do not touch doors.

            They know nothing of this pleasure: pushing before one gently or brusquely one of those large familiar panels, then turning back to replace it—holding a door in one’s arms.

            …The pleasure of grabbing the midriff of one of these tall obstacles to a room by its porcelain node; that short clinch during which movement stops, the eye widens, and the whole body adjusts to its new surrounding.

            With a friendly hand one still holds on to it, before closing it decisively and shutting oneself in—which the click of the tight but well-oiled spring pleasantly confirms.

 

 

 

 

Water

 

            Below me, always below me is water.  Always with lowered eye do I look at it.  It is like the ground, like a part of the ground, a modification of the ground.

            It is bright and brilliant, formless and fresh, passive yet persistent in its one vice, gravity; disposing of extraordinary means to satisfy that vice—twisting, piercing, eroding, filtering.

            This vice works from within as well: water collapses all the time, constantly sacrifices all form, tends only to humble itself, flattens itself on the ground, like a corpse, like the monks of certain orders.  Always lower—that could be its motto; the opposite of excelsior.

 

*

            One might almost say that water is mad, because of its hysterical need to obey gravity alone, a need that possesses it like an obsession.

            Of course, everything in the world responds to this need, which always and everywhere must be satisfied.  This cabinet, for example, proves to be terribly stubborn in its desire to stay on the ground, and if one day it found itself badly balanced, would sooner fall to pieces than run counter to that desire.But to a certain degree it teases gravity, defies it; does not give way in all its parts: its cornice, its moldings do not give in. Inherent in the cabinet is a resistance that benefits its personality and form.

            LIQUID, by definition, is that which chooses to obey gravity rather than maintain its form, which rejects all form in order to obey gravity—and which loses all dignity because of that obsession, that pathological anxiety.  Because of that vice—which makes it fast, flowing, or stagnant, formless or fearsome, formless and fearsome, piercingly fearsome in cases; devious, filtering, winding—one can do anything one wants with it, even lead water through pipes to make it spout out vertically so as to enjoy the way it collapses in droplets:  a real slave.

            The sun and the moon, however, are envious of this exclusive influence, and try to take over whenever water happens to offer the opening of great expanses, and above all when in a state of least resistance—spread out in shallow puddles.  Then the sun exacts an even greater tribute: forces it into a perpetual cycle, treats it like a gerbil on a wheel.

 

*

 

            Water eludes me…slips between my fingers.  And even so! It’s not even that clean (like a lizard or a frog): it leaves traces, spots, on my hands that are quite slow to dry or have to be wiped. Water escapes me yet marks me, and there is not a thing I can do about it.

            Ideologically it’s the same thing: it eludes me, eludes all definition, but in my mind and on this sheet leaves traces, formless marks.

 

*

 

            Water’s instability: sensitive to the slightest change of level.  Running down stairs two at a time.  Playful, childishly obedient, returning as soon as called if one alters the slope on this side.

 

 

 

 

The Horse

 

        Many times the size of a man, the horse has flaring nostrils, round eyes under half-closed lids, cocked ears and long muscular neck.

            The tallest of man’s domestic animals, and truly his designated mount.

            Man, somewhat lost on an elephant, is at his best on a horse, truly a throne to his measure.

            We will not do away with the horse, I hope?

            He will not become a curiosity in a zoo?

           …Already now, in town, he is no more than a miserable substitute for the automobile, the most miserable means of traction.

            Ah, the horse is also—does man suspect it?—something else besides! He is impatience nostrilized.

            His weapons are running, biting, bucking.

            He seems to have a keen nose, keen ears, and very sensitive eyes.

            The greatest tribute one can pay him is having to fit him with blinders.

            But no weapon…
            Whereby the temptation to add one.  One only.  A horn.  Thereby the unicorn.

 

            The horse, terribly nervous, is aerophagous.

            Hypersensitive, he clamps his jaws, holds his breath, then releases it, making the walls of his nasal cavities vibrate loudly.

            That is why this noble beast, who feeds on air and grass alone, produces only straw turds and thunderous fragrant farts.

            Fragrant thunderisms.

 

            What am I saying, feeds on air?  Gets drunk on it.  Sniffs it, savors it, snorts it.

            He rushes into it, shakes his mane in it, kicks up his hind legs in it.

            He would evidently like to fly up into it.

            The flight of clouds inspires him, urges him to imitation.

            He does imitate it: he tosses, prances…

            And when the whip’s lightning claps, the clouds gallop faster and rain tramples the earth…

 

            Out of your stall, high-spirited over-sensitive armoire, all polished and smoothed!

            Great beautiful period piece!

            Polished ebony or mahogany.

            Stroke the withers of this armoire and immediately it has a faraway look.

            Dust cloth at the lips,feather mop at the rump, key in the lock of the nostrils.

 

            His skin quivers, irritably tolerating flies, his shoe hammers the ground.

            He lowers his head, leans his muzzle toward the ground and consoles himself with grass.

            A stepstool is needed to look on the upper shelf.

            Ticklish skin, as I was saying…but his natural impatience is so profound, that inside his body the parts of his skeleton behave like pebbles in a torrent!

 

            Seen from the apse, the highest animal nave in the stable…

 

            Great saint! Great horse! Beautiful behind in the stable…

            What is this splendid courtesan’s behind that greets me, set on slim legs, high heels?

            Giant goose of the golden eggs, strangely clipped.

            Ah, it is the smell of gold that assails my nostrils!

            Leather and manure mixed together.

            Strong-smelling omelette, from the goose of the golden eggs.

            Straw omelette, earth omelette, flavored with the rum of your urine, dropping from the crack under your tail…

            As though fresh from the oven, on a pastry sheet, the stable’s rolls and rum balls.

            Great saint, with your Byzantine eyes, woeful, under the harness…

 

            A sort of saint, humble monk at prayer, in the twilight.

            A monk?  What am I saying?…A pontiff, on his excremental palanquin! A pope—exhibiting to all comers a splendid courtesan’s behind, generously heart-shaped, on slender legs ending elegantly in high-heeled shoes.

            WHAT IS THIS CLACKING OF THE BIT?

            THESE DULL THUDS IN THE STALL?

            WHAT’S GOING ON?

            PONTIFF AT PRAYER?

            SCHOOLBOY IN DETENTION?

            GREAT SAINTS! GREAT HORSES (HORSES OR HEROES?), OF THE BEAUTIFUL BEHIND IN THE STABLE,

WHY, SAINTLY MONK, ARE YOU WEARING RIDING BREECHES?

—INTERRUPTED DURING HIS MASS, HE TURNED HIS BYZATINE EYES TOWARD US…



“the withness of the body” –Whitehead

The heavy bear who goes with me,
A manifold honey to smear his face,
Clumsy and lumbering here and there,
The central ton of every place,
The hungry beating brutish one
In love with candy, anger, and sleep,
Crazy factotum, disheveling all,
Climbs the building, kicks the football,
Boxes his brother in the hate-ridden city.

Breathing at my side, that heavy animal,
That heavy bear who sleeps with me,
Howls in his sleep for a world of sugar,
A sweetness intimate as the water’s clasp,
Howls in his sleep because the tight-rope
Trembles and shows the darkness beneath.
–The strutting show-off is terrified,
Dressed in his dress-suit, bulging his pants,
Trembles to think that his quivering meat
Must finally wince to nothing at all.

That inescapable animal walks with me,
Has followed me since the black womb held,
Moves where I move, distorting my gesture,
A caricature, a swollen shadow,
A stupid clown of the spirit’s motive,
Perplexes and affronts with his own darkness,
The secret life of belly and bone,
Opaque, too near, my private, yet unknown,
Stretches to embrace the very dear
With whom I would walk without him near,
Touches her grossly, although a word
Would bare my heart and make me clear,
Stumbles, flounders, and strives to be fed
Dragging me with him in his mouthing care,
Amid the hundred million of his kind,
The scrimmage of appetite everywhere.


Fork

This strange thing must have crept 
Right out of hell. 
It resembles a bird's foot 
Worn around the cannibal's neck. 
As you hold it in your hand, 
As you stab with it into a piece of meat, 
It is possible to imagine the rest of the bird: 
Its head which like your fist 
Is large, bald, beakless and blind. 
 

Animal Acts

A bear who eats with a silver spoon. 
Two apes adept at grave-digging. 
Rats who do calculus. 
A police dog who copulates with a woman, 
Who takes undertaker's measurements.

A bedbug who suffers, who has doubts 
About his existence.  The miraculous 
Laughing dove.  A thousand-year-old turtle 
Playing billiards.  A chicken who 
Cuts his own throat, who bleeds.

The trainer with his sugar-cubes, 
With his chair and whip.  The evenings 
When they all huddle in a cage, 
Smoking cheap cigars, lazily 
Marking the cards in the new deck. 
 

Harsh Climate

The brain itself in its skull 
Is very cold, 
According to 
Albertus Magnus.

Something like a stretch of tundra 
On the scale of the universe. 
Galactic wind. 
Lofty icebergs in the distance.

Polar night. 
A large ocean liner caught in the ice. 
A few lights still burning on the deck. 
Silence and fierce cold. 
 

Bestiary for the Fingers of My Right Hand

1. 
Thumb, loose tooth of a horse. 
Rooster to his hens. 
Horn of a devil.  Fat worm 
They have attached to my flesh 
At the time of my birth. 
It takes four to hold him down, 
Bend him in half, until the bone 
Begins to whimper. 
Cut him off.  He can take care 
Of himself.  Take root in the earth, 
Or go hunting with wolves.

2. 
The second points the way. 
True way.  The path crosses the earth, 
The moon and some stars. 
Watch, he points further. 
He points to himself.

3. 
The middle one has backache. 
Stiff, still unaccustomed to this life: 
An old man at birth.  It's about something 
That he had and lost, 
That he looks for within my hand, 
The way a dog looks 
For fleas 
With a sharp tooth.

4. 
The fourth is mystery. 
Sometimes as my hand 
Rests on the table 
He jumps by himself 
As though someone called his name.

After each bone, finger, 
I come to him, troubled.

5. 
Something stirs in the fifth 
Something perpetually at the point 
Of birth.  Weak and submissive, 
His touch is gentle. 
It weighs a tear. 
It takes the mote out of the eye.


Riprap

Lay down these words
Before your mind like rocks.
             placed solid, by hands   
In choice of place, set
Before the body of the mind
             in space and time:
Solidity of bark, leaf, or wall
             riprap of things:
Cobble of milky way,
             straying planets,
These poems, people,
             lost ponies with
Dragging saddles—
             and rocky sure-foot trails.   
The worlds like an endless   
             four-dimensional
Game of Go.
             ants and pebbles
In the thin loam, each rock a word   
             a creek-washed stone
Granite: ingrained
             with torment of fire and weight   
Crystal and sediment linked hot
             all change, in thoughts,   
As well as things.
 

 

 

Above Pate Valley

We finished clearing the last   
Section of trail by noon,
High on the ridge-side
Two thousand feet above the creek   
Reached the pass, went on
Beyond the white pine groves,   
Granite shoulders, to a small
Green meadow watered by the snow,   
Edged with Aspen—sun
Straight high and blazing
But the air was cool.
Ate a cold fried trout in the   
Trembling shadows. I spied
A glitter, and found a flake
Black volcanic glass—obsidian—
By a flower. Hands and knees   
Pushing the Bear grass, thousands   
Of arrowhead leavings over a   
Hundred yards. Not one good   
Head, just razor flakes
On a hill snowed all but summer,   
A land of fat summer deer,
They came to camp. On their   
Own trails. I followed my own   
Trail here. Picked up the cold-drill,   
Pick, singlejack, and sack
Of dynamite.
Ten thousand years.
 

Mid-August at Sourdough Mountain Lookout

Down valley a smoke haze
Three days heat, after five days rain   
Pitch glows on the fir-cones
Across rocks and meadows
Swarms of new flies.
 
I cannot remember things I once read   
A few friends, but they are in cities.   
Drinking cold snow-water from a tin cup   
Looking down for miles
Through high still air.
 

 

How Poetry Comes to Me

It comes blundering over the
Boulders at night, it stays
Frightened outside the
Range of my campfire
I go to meet it at the
Edge of the light

For All

Ah to be alive
on a mid-September morn
fording a stream
barefoot, pants rolled up,
holding boots, pack on,
sunshine, ice in the shallows,
northern rockies.

Rustle and shimmer of icy creek waters
stones turn underfoot, small and hard as toes
cold nose dripping
singing inside
creek music, heart music,
smell of sun on gravel.

I pledge allegiance

I pledge allegiance to the soil
of Turtle Island,
and to the beings who thereon dwell
one ecosystem
in diversity
under the sun
With joyful interpenetration for all.

On Top

All this new stuff goes on top
turn it over, turn it over
wait and water down
from the dark bottom
turn it inside out
let it spread through
Sift down even.
Watch it sprout.

A mind like compost.

Hay for the Horses

He had driven half the night
From far down San Joaquin
Through Mariposa, up the
Dangerous Mountain roads,
And pulled in at eight a.m.
With his big truckload of hay
            behind the barn.
With winch and ropes and hooks
We stacked the bales up clean
To splintery redwood rafters
High in the dark, flecks of alfalfa
Whirling through shingle-cracks of light,
Itch of haydust in the 
            sweaty shirt and shoes.
At lunchtime under Black oak
Out in the hot corral,
---The old mare nosing lunchpails,
Grasshoppers crackling in the weeds---
"I'm sixty-eight" he said,
"I first bucked hay when I was seventeen.
I thought, that day I started,
I sure would hate to do this all my life.
And dammit, that's just what
I've gone and done."

Old Bones

Out there walking round, looking out for food,
a rootstock, a birdcall, a seed that you can crack
plucking, digging, snaring, snagging,
        barely getting by, 

no food out there on dusty slopes of scree—
carry some—look for some,
go for a hungry dream.
Deer bone, Dall sheep,
        bones hunger home. 

Out there somewhere
a shrine for the old ones,
the dust of the old bones,
        old songs and tales. 

What we ate—who ate what—
        how we all prevailed.

Kisiabaton

Beat-up datsun idling in the road
shreds of fog
almost-vertical hillsides drop away
huge stumps fading into mist
soft warm rain

Snaggy, forked and spreading tops, a temperate cloud-forest tree

Chamaecyparis formosiana--
Taiwan hinoki,
hung-kuai     red cypress

That the tribal people call kisiabaton

this rare old tree
is what we came to see.

At Tower Peak

Every tan rolling meadow will turn into housing
Freeways are clogged all day
Academies packed with scholars writing papers
City people lean and dark
This land most real 
As its western-tending golden slopes
And bird-entangled central valley swamps
Sea-lion, urchin coasts
Southerly salmon-probes 
Into the aromatic almost-Mexican hills
Along a range of granite peaks
The names forgotten,
An eastward running river that ends out in desert
The chipping ground-squirrels in the tumbled blocks
The gloss of glacier ghost on slab
Where we wake refreshed from ten hours sleep
After a long day's walking
Packing burdens to the snow
Wake to the same old world of no names,
No things, new as ever, rock and water,
Cool dawn birdcalls, high jet contrails.
A day or two or million, breathing
A few steps back from what goes down
In the current realm.
A kind of ice age, spreading, filling valleys
Shaving soils, paving fields, you can walk in it
Live in it, drive through it then 
It melts away
For whatever sprouts
After the age of
Frozen hearts. Flesh-carved rock
And gusts on the summit,
Smoke from forest fires is white,
The haze above the distant valley like a dusk.
It's just one world, this spine of rock and streams
And snow, and the wash of gravels, silts
Sands, bunchgrasses, saltbrush, bee-fields,
Twenty million human people, downstream, here below.

Smokey the Bear Sutra

Once in the Jurassic about 150 million years ago,
the Great Sun Buddha in this corner of the Infinite
Void gave a Discourse to all the assembled elements
and energies: to the standing beings, the walking beings,
the flying beings, and the sitting beings -- even grasses,
to the number of thirteen billion, each one born from a
seed, assembled there: a Discourse concerning
Enlightenment on the planet Earth. 

"In some future time, there will be a continent called
America. It will have great centers of power called
such as Pyramid Lake, Walden Pond, Mt. Rainier, Big Sur,
Everglades, and so forth; and powerful nerves and channels
such as Columbia River, Mississippi River, and Grand Canyon
The human race in that era will get into troubles all over
its head, and practically wreck everything in spite of
its own strong intelligent Buddha-nature." 

"The twisting strata of the great mountains and the pulsings
of volcanoes are my love burning deep in the earth.
My obstinate compassion is schist and basalt and
granite, to be mountains, to bring down the rain. In that
future American Era I shall enter a new form; to cure
the world of loveless knowledge that seeks with blind hunger:
and mindless rage eating food that will not fill it." 

And he showed himself in his true form of

SMOKEY THE BEAR

·        A handsome smokey-colored brown bear standing on his hind legs, showing that he is aroused and
watchful.

·        Bearing in his right paw the Shovel that digs to the truth beneath appearances; cuts the roots of useless
attachments, and flings damp sand on the fires of greed and war;

·        His left paw in the Mudra of Comradely Display -- indicating that all creatures have the full right to live to their limits and that deer, rabbits, chipmunks, snakes, dandelions, and lizards all grow in the realm of the Dharma;

·        Wearing the blue work overalls symbolic of slaves and laborers, the countless men oppressed by a
civilization that claims to save but often destroys;

·        Wearing the broad-brimmed hat of the West, symbolic of the forces that guard the Wilderness, which is the Natural State of the Dharma and the True Path of man on earth: all true paths lead through mountains --

·        With a halo of smoke and flame behind, the forest fires of the kali-yuga, fires caused by the stupidity of
those who think things can be gained and lost whereas in truth all is contained vast and free in the Blue Sky and Green Earth of One Mind;

·        Round-bellied to show his kind nature and that the great earth has food enough for everyone who loves her and trusts her;

·        Trampling underfoot wasteful freeways and needless suburbs; smashing the worms of capitalism and
totalitarianism;

·        Indicating the Task: his followers, becoming free of cars, houses, canned foods, universities, and shoes;
master the Three Mysteries of their own Body, Speech, and Mind; and fearlessly chop down the rotten
trees and prune out the sick limbs of this country America and then burn the leftover trash.

Wrathful but Calm. Austere but Comic. Smokey the Bear will
Illuminate those who would help him; but for those who would hinder or
slander him,

HE WILL PUT THEM OUT.

Thus his great Mantra:

Namah samanta vajranam chanda maharoshana
Sphataya hum traka ham nam

"I DEDICATE MYSELF TO THE UNIVERSAL DIAMOND
BE THIS RAGING FURY DESTROYED"

And he will protect those who love woods and rivers,
Gods and animals, hobos and madmen, prisoners and sick
people, musicians, playful women, and hopeful children: 

And if anyone is threatened by advertising, air pollution, television,
or the police, they should chant SMOKEY THE BEAR'S WAR SPELL:

DROWN THEIR BUTTS
CRUSH THEIR BUTTS
DROWN THEIR BUTTS
CRUSH THEIR BUTTS

And SMOKEY THE BEAR will surely appear to put the enemy out
with his vajra-shovel.

·        Now those who recite this Sutra and then try to put it in practice will accumulate merit as countless as the sands of Arizona and Nevada.

·        Will help save the planet Earth from total oil slick.

·        Will enter the age of harmony of man and nature.

·        Will win the tender love and caresses of men, women, and beasts.

·        Will always have ripe blackberries to eat and a sunny spot under a pine tree to sit at.

·        AND IN THE END WILL WIN HIGHEST PERFECT ENLIGHTENMENT. 

thus have we heard.

Ellen West 
I love sweets,—
                              heaven
would be dying on a bed of vanilla ice cream . . .
 
But my true self
is thin, all profile
 
and effortless gestures, the sort of blond
elegant girl whose
                                body is the image of her soul.
 
—My doctors tell me I must give up
this ideal;
                 but I
WILL NOT . . . cannot.
 
Only to my husband I'm not simply a "case."
 
But he is a fool. He married
meat, and thought it was a wife.
 
* * *
 
Why am I a girl?
 
I ask my doctors, and they tell me they
don't know, that it is just "given."
 
But it has such
implications—;
                            and sometimes,
I even feel like a girl.
 
* * *
 
Now, at the beginning of Ellen's thirty-second year, her
physical condition has deteriorated still further. Her use
of laxatives increases beyond measure. Every evening she
takes sixty to seventy tablets of a laxative, with the result
that she suffers tortured vomiting at night and violent
diarrhea by day, often accompanied by a weakness of the
heart. She has thinned down to a skeleton, and weighs
only 92 pounds.
 
* * *
 
About five years ago, I was in a restaurant,
eating alone
                           with a book. I was
not married, and often did that . . .
 
—I'd turn down
dinner invitations, so I could eat alone;
 
I'd allow myself two pieces of bread, with
butter, at the beginning, and three scoops of
vanilla ice cream, at the end,—
 
                                                     sitting there alone
 
with a book, both in the book
and out of it, waited on, idly
watching people,—
 
                                    when an attractive young man
and woman, both elegantly dressed,
sat next to me.
 
                            She was beautiful—;
 
with sharp, clear features, a good
bone structure—;
                               if she took her make-up off
in front of you, rubbing cold cream
again and again across her skin, she still would be
beautiful—
                   more beautiful.
 
And he,—
                   I couldn't remember when I had seen a man
so attractive. I didn't know why. He was almost
 
a male version
                             of her,—
 
I had the sudden, mad notion that I
wanted to be his lover . . .
 
—Were they married?
                                      were they lovers?
 
They didn't wear wedding rings.
 
Their behavior was circumspect. They discussed
politics. They didn't touch . . .
 
—How could I discover?
 
                                                Then, when the first course
arrived, I noticed the way
 
each held his fork out for the other
 
to taste what he had ordered . . .
 
                                                                 They did this
again and again, with pleased looks, indulgent
smiles, for each course,
                                     more than once for each dish—;
much too much for just friends . . .
 
—Their behavior somehow sickened me;
 
the way each gladly
put the food the other had offered into his mouth—;
 
I knew what they were. I knew they slept together.
 
An immense depression came over me . . .
 
—I knew I could never
with such ease allow another to put food into my mouth:
 
happily myself put food into another's mouth—;
 
I knew that to become a wife I would have to give up my ideal.
 
* * *
 
Even as a child,
I saw that the "natural" process of aging
 
is for one's middle to thicken—
one's skin to blotch;
 
as happened to my mother.
And her mother.
                            I loathed "Nature."
 
At twelve, pancakes
became the most terrible thought there is. . .
 
I shall defeat "Nature."
 
In the hospital, when they
weigh me, I wear weights secretly sewn into my belt.

January 16. The patient is allowed to eat in her room, but comes
readily with her husband to afternoon coffee. Previously she had
stoutly resisted this on the ground that she did not really eat but
devoured like a wild animal. This she demonstrated with utmost
realism . . . . Her physical examination showed nothing striking.
Salivary-glands are markedly enlarged on both sides.
January 21. Has been reading Faust again. In her diary,
writes that art is the "mutual permeation" of the "world of the
body" and the "world of the spirit." Says that her own poems
are "hospital poems . . . weak—without skill or perseverance;
only managing to beat their wings softly."
February 8. Agitation, quickly subsided again. Has
attached herself to an elegant, very thin female patient. Homo-
erotic component strikingly evident.
February 15. Vexation, and torment. Says that her mind
forces her always to think of eating. Feels herself degraded by
this. Has entirely, for the first time in years, stopped writing poetry.

Callas is my favorite singer, but I've only
seen her once—;
 
I've never forgotten that night. . .
 
—It was in Tosca, she had long before
lost weight, her voice
had been, for years,
                                  deteriorating, half itself. . .
 
When her career began, of course, she was fat,
 
enormous—; in the early photographs,
sometimes I almost don't recognize her. . .
 
The voice too then was enormous—
 
healthy; robust; subtle; but capable of
crude effects, even vulgar,
                                             almost out of
high spirits, too much health. . .
 
But soon she felt that she must lose weight,—
that all she was trying to express
 
was obliterated by her body,
buried in flesh—;
                               abruptly, within
four months, she lost at least sixty pounds. . .
 
—The gossip in Milan was that Callas
had swallowed a tapeworm.
 
But of course she hadn't.
 
                                            The tapeworm
was her soul. . .
 
—How her soul, uncompromising,
insatiable,
                    must have loved eating the flesh from her bones,
 
revealing this extraordinarily
mercurial; fragile; masterly creature. . .
 
—But irresistibly, nothing
stopped there; the huge voice
 
also began to change: at first, it simply diminished
in volume, in size,
                                  then the top notes became
shrill, unreliable—at last,
usually not there at all. . .
 
—No one knows why. Perhaps her mind,
ravenous, still insatiable, sensed
 
that to struggle with the shreds of a voice
 
must make her artistry subtler, more refined,
more capable of expressing humiliation,
rage, betrayal. . .
 
—Perhaps the opposite. Perhaps her spirit
loathed the unending struggle
 
to embody itself, to manifest itself, on a stage whose
 
mechanics, and suffocating customs,
seemed expressly designed to annihilate spirit. . .
 
—I know that in Tosca, in the second act,
when, humiliated, hounded by Scarpia,
she sang Vissi d'arte
                                      —"I lived for art"—
 
and in torment, bewilderment, at the end she asks,
with a voice reaching
                                      harrowingly for the notes,
 
"Art has repaid me LIKE THIS?"
 
                                                           I felt I was watching
autobiography—
                              an art; skill;
virtuosity
 
miles distant from the usual soprano's
athleticism,—
                         the usual musician's dream
of virtuosity without content. . .
 
—I wonder what she feels, now,
listening to her recordings.
 
For they have already, within a few years,
begun to date. . .
 
Whatever they express
they express through the style of a decade
and a half—;
                         a style she helped create. . .
 
—She must know that now
she probably would not do a trill in
exactly that way,—
                                   that the whole sound, atmosphere,
dramaturgy of her recordings
 
have just slightly become those of the past. . .
 
—Is it bitter? Does her soul
tell her
 
that she was an idiot ever to think
anything
                material wholly could satisfy?. . .
 
—Perhaps it says: The only way
to escape
the History of Styles
 
is not to have a body.
 
* * *
 
When I open my eyes in the morning, my great
mystery
             stands before me . . .
 
—I know that I am intelligent; therefore
 
the inability not to fear food
day-and-night; this unending hunger
ten minutes after I have eaten . . .
                                                          a childish
dread of eating; hunger which can have no cause,—
 
half my mind says that all this
is demeaning . . .
 
                                 Bread
 
for days on end
drives all real thought from my brain . . .
 
—Then I think, No. The ideal of being thin
 
conceals the ideal
not to have a body—;
                                     which is NOT trivial . . .
 
This wish seems now as much a "given" of my existence
 
as the intolerable
fact that I am dark-complexioned; big-boned;
and once weighed
one hundred and sixty-five pounds . . .
 
—But then I think, No. That's too simple,—
 
without a body, who can
know himself at all?
                                   Only by
acting; choosing; rejecting; have I
made myself—
                         discovered who and what Ellen can be . . .
 
—But then again I think, NO. This I is anterior
 
to name; gender; action;
fashion;
                MATTER ITSELF,—
 
. . . trying to stop my hunger with FOOD
is like trying to appease thirst
                                                   with ink.

March 30. Result of the consultation: Both gentlemen agree
completely with my prognosis and doubt any therapeutic
usefulness of commitment even more emphatically than I.
All three of us are agreed that it is not a case of obsessional
neurosis and not one of manic-depressive psychosis, and that
no definitely reliable therapy is possible. We therefore resolved
to give in to the patient's demand for discharge.

The train-ride yesterday
was far worse than I expected . . .
 
                                                         In our compartment
 
were ordinary people: a student;
a woman; her child;—
 
they had ordinary bodies, pleasant faces;
                                                                            but I thought
 
I was surrounded by creatures
 
with the pathetic, desperate
desire to be not what they were:—
 
the student was short,
and carried his body as if forcing
it to be taller—;
 
the woman showed her gums when she smiled,
and often held her
hand up to hide them—;
 
the child
seemed to cry simply because it was
small; a dwarf, and helpless . . .
 
—I was hungry. I had insisted that my husband
not bring food . . .
 
After about thirty minutes, the woman
peeled an orange
 
to quiet the child. She put a section
into its mouth—;
                               immediately it spit it out.
 
The piece fell to the floor.
 
—She pushed it with her foot through the dirt
toward me
several inches.
 
My husband saw me staring
down at the piece . . .
 
—I didn't move; how I wanted
to reach out,
                        and as if invisible
 
shove it in my mouth—;
 
my body
became rigid. As I stared at him,
I could see him staring
 
at me,—
                then he looked at the student—; at the woman—; then
back to me . . .
 
I didn't move.
 
—At last, he bent down, and
casually
               threw it out the window.
 
He looked away.
 
—I got up to leave the compartment, then
saw his face,—
 
his eyes
were red;
                and I saw
 
—I'm sure I saw—
 
disappointment.
 
* * *
 
At breakfast she eats butter and sugar, at noon she eats
so much that—for the first time in thirteen years!—she is
satisfied by her food and gets really full. At afternoon
coffee she eats chocolate creams and Easter eggs. She
takes a walk with her husband, reads poems, listens to
recordings, is in a positively festive mood, and all heavi-
ness seems to have fallen away from her. She writes
letters, the last one a letter to the fellow patient here to
whom she had become so attached. In the evening she
takes a lethal dose of poison, and on the following morn-
ing she is dead. "She looked as she had never looked in
life—calm and happy and peaceful."

Dearest.—I remember how
at eighteen,
                     on hikes with friends, when
they rested, sitting down to joke or talk,
 
I circled
around them, afraid to hike ahead alone,
 
yet afraid to rest
when I was not yet truly thin.
 
You and, yes, my husband,—
you and he
 
have by degrees drawn me within the circle;
forced me to sit down at last on the ground.
 
I am grateful.
 
But something in me refuses it.
 
—How eager I have been
to compromise, to kill this refuser,—
 
but each compromise, each attempt
to poison an ideal
which often seemed to me sterile and unreal,
 
heightens my hunger.
 
I am crippled. I disappoint you.
 
Will you greet with anger, or
happiness,
 
the news which might well reach you
before this letter?
 
Your Ellen.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Herbert White 
"When I hit her on the head, it was good,

and then I did it to her a couple of times,--
but it was funny,--afterwards,
it was as if somebody else did it ...

Everything flat, without sharpness, richness or line.

Still, I liked to drive past the woods where she lay,
tell the old lady and the kids I had to take a piss,
hop out and do it to her ...

The whole buggy of them waiting for me
made me feel good;
but still, just like I knew all along,
she didn't move.

When the body got too discomposed,
I'd just jack off, letting it fall on her ...

--It sounds crazy, but I tell you
sometimes it was beautiful--; I don't know how
to say it, but for a minute, everything was possible--;
and then,
then,--
well, like I said, she didn't move: and I saw,
under me, a little girl was just lying there in the mud:

and I knew I couldn't have done that,--
somebody else had to have done that,--
standing above her there,
in those ordinary, shitty leaves ...

--One time, I went to see Dad in a motel where he was
staying with a woman; but she was gone;
you could smell the wine in the air; and he started,
real embarrassing, to cry ...
He was still a little drunk,
and asked me to forgive him for
all he hasn't done--; but, What the shit?
Who would have wanted to stay with Mom? with bastards
not even his own kids?

I got in the truck, and started to drive
and saw a little girl--
who I picked up, hit on the head, and
screwed, and screwed, and screwed, and screwed, then

buried,
in the garden of the motel ...

--You see, ever since I was a kid I wanted
to feel things make sense: I remember

looking out the window of my room back home,--
and being almost suffocated by the asphalt;
and grass; and trees; and glass;
just there, just there, doing nothing!
not saying anything! filling me up--
but also being a wall; dead, and stopping me;
--how I wanted to see beneath it, cut

beneath it, and make it
somehow, come alive ...

The salt of the earth;
Mom once said, 'Man's spunk is the salt of the earth ...'

--That night, at that Twenty-nine Palms Motel
I had passed a million times on the road, everything

fit together; was alright;
it seemed like
everything had to be there, like I had spent years
trying, and at last finally finished drawing this
huge circle ...

--But then, suddenly I knew
somebody else did it, some bastard
had hurt a little girl--; the motel
I could see again, it had been
itself all the time, a lousy
pile of bricks, plaster, that didn't seem to
have to be there,--but was, just by chance ...

--Once, on the farm, when I was a kid,
I was screwing a goat; and the rope around his neck
when he tried to get away
pulled tight;--and just when I came,
he died ...
I came back the next day; jacked off over his body;
but it didn't do any good ...

Mom once said:
'Man's spunk is the salt of the earth, and grows kids.'

I tried so hard to come; more pain than anything else;
but didn't do any good ...

--About six months ago, I heard Dad remarried,
so I drove over to Connecticut to see him and see
if he was happy.
She was twenty-five years younger than him:
she had lots of little kids, and I don't know why,
I felt shaky ...

I stopped in front of the address; and
snuck up to the window to look in ...
--There he was, a kid
six months old on his lap, laughing
and bouncing the kid, happy in his old age
to play the papa after years of sleeping around,--
it twisted me up ...
To think that what he wouldn't give me,
he wanted to give them ...

I could have killed the bastard ...

--Naturally, I just got right back in the car,
and believe me, was determined, determined,
to head straight for home ...

but the more I drove,
I kept thinking about getting a girl,
and the more I thought I shouldn't do it,
the more I had to--

I saw her coming out of the movies,
saw she was alone, and
kept circling the blocks as she walked along them,
saying, 'You're going to leave her alone.'
'You're going to leave her alone.'

--The woods were scary!
As the seasons changed, and you saw more and more
of the skull show through, the nights became clearer,
and the buds,--erect, like nipples ...

--But then, one night,
nothing worked ...
Nothing in the sky
would blur like I wanted it to;
and I couldn't, couldn't,
get it to seem to me
that somebody else did it ...

I tried, and tried, but there was just me there,
and her, and the sharp trees
saying, "That's you standing there.
You're ...
just you."

I hope I fry.

--Hell came when I saw
MYSELF ...
and couldn't stand
what I see ..." 


The Wounded Breakfast

    A huge shoe mounts up from the horizon, squealing and grinding forward on small wheels, even as a man sitting to breakfast on his veranda is suddenly engulfed in a great shadow almost the size of the night. 
    He looks up and sees a huge shoe ponderously mounting out of the earth.  Up in the unlaced ankle-part an old woman stands at a helm behind the great tongue curled forward; the thick laces dragging like ships' rope on the ground as the huge thing squeals and grinds forward; children everywhere, they look from the shoelace holes, they crowd about the old woman, even as she pilots this huge shoe over the earth. . . 
    Soon the huge shoe is descending the opposite horizon, a monstrous snail squealing and grinding into the earth. . . 
    The man turns to his breakfast again, but sees it's been wounded, the yolk of one of his eggs is bleeding. . . 
  
 

The Automobile

A man had just married an automobile.

    But I mean to say, said his father, that the automobile is not a person because it is something different.

    For instance, compare it to your mother.  Do you see how it is different from your mother?  Somehow it seems wider, doesn't it?  And besides, your mother wears her hair differently.

    You ought to try to find something in the world that looks like mother.

    I have mother, isn't that enough that looks like mother?  Do I have to gather more mothers?

    They are all old ladies who do not in the least excite any wish to procreate, said the son.

    But you cannot procreate with an automobile, said father.

    The son shows father an ignition key.  See, here is a special penis which does with the automobile as the man with the woman; and the automobile gives birth to a place far from this place, dropping its puppy miles as it goes.

    Does that make me a grandfather? said father.

    That makes you where you are when I am far away, said the son.

    Father and mother watch an automobile with a just married sign on it growing smaller in a road. 
  
  
  
 

The Fall 
 

    There was a man who found two leaves and came indoors holding them out saying to his parents that he was a tree.

    To which they said then go into the yard and do not grow in the living-room as your roots may ruin the carpet.

    He said I was fooling I am not a tree and he dropped his leaves.

    But his parents said look it is fall. 
  
  
 

A Cottage in the Wood 
 

    He has built himself a cottage in a wood, near where the insect rubs its wings in song. 
    Yet, without measure, or proper sense of scale, he has made the cottage too small.  He realizes this when only his hand will fit through the door.  He tries the stairs to the second floor with his fingers, but his arm wedges in the entrance.  He wonders how he will cook his dinner.  He might get his hands through the kitchen window.  But even so, he will not be able to cook enough on such a tiny stove. 
    He shall also lie unsheltered in the night, even though a bed with its covers turned down waits for him in the cottage. 
    He lies down and curls himself around the cottage, listening to the insect that rubs its wings in song. 
  
  
 

The Broken Daughter 
 

    His daughter had broken.  He took her to be repaired. . .If you'll just pump-up her backside, and rewire her hair. . .

    This girl needs a whole new set of valves, and look at all those collision marks around her face, said the mechanic.

    I just want her fixed-up enough to use around the house; for longer trips I have my wife. 
  
  
 

Cinderella's Life at the Castle 
 

    After Cinderella married the prince she turned her attention to minutiae, using her glass slipper as a magnifying lens. 
    When at court she would wear orange peels and fish tins, and other decorous rubbish as found in back of the castle.

    You are making me very nervous, said the prince. 
    But Cinderella continued to look at something through her glass slipper. 
    Did you hear me? said the prince. 
    Cinderella's mouth hung open as she continued to look at something through her glass slipper. 
    Did you hear me, did you hear me, did you hear me? screamed the prince. 
  
 

A Journey Through the Moonlight

    In sleep when an old man's body is no longer aware of its boundaries, and lies flattened by gravity like a mere of wax in its bed. . .It drips down to the floor and moves there like a tear down a cheek. . .Under the back door  into the silver meadow, like a pool of sperm, frosty under the moon, as if in his first nature, boneless and absurd.

    The moon lifts him up into its white field, a cloud shaped like an old man, porous with stars. 
    He floats through high dark branches, a corpse tangled in a tree on a river. 
 

Summer, Forty Years Later

    He struggles out of a closet where his mother had hung him forty years ago. 
    She didn't understand children; she probably thought he was something made of cloth. 
    He thinks he as waited long enough for her to understand children, even though he is no longer a child. 
    After forty years a man has a right to seek the hallway; after all, he might even hope for the front door--and who knows, perhaps even a Nobel Prize for patience!

    From the front porch he sees that the midday sky is darker than he remembered it; the green of the lawn and trees has also darkened:  too many nights, too many coats of varnish. . . . 
    This is not the same summer, the color is gone. . .

    . . . That little boy who is always passing the house with his wagon has turned into a little old man collecting garbage. . . 
  

  Poems by Ai 
  
 
Cuba, 1962 
 

When the rooster jumps up on the windowsill 
and spreads his red-gold wings, 
I wake, thinking it is the sun 
and call Juanita, hearing her answer, 
but only in my mind. 
I know she is already outside, 
breaking the cane off at ground level, 
using only her big hands. 
I get the machete and walk among the cane, 
until I see her, lying face-down in the dirt.

Juanita, dead in the morning like this. 
I raise the machete—
what I take from the earth, I give back—
and cut off her feet. 
I lift the body and carry it to the wagon, 
where I load the cane to sell in the village. 
Whoever tastes my woman in his candy, his cake, 
tastes something sweeter than this sugar cane; 
it is grief. 
If you eat too much of it, you want more, 
you can never get enough. 
 


The Anniversary 
 

You raise the ax, 
the block of wood screams in half, 
while I lift the sack of flour 
and carry it into the house. 
I'm not afraid of the blade 
you've just pointed at my head. 
If I were dead, you could take the boy, 
hunt, kiss gnats, instead of my moist lips. 
Take it easy, squabs are roasting, 
corn, still in husks, crackles, 
as the boy dances around the table: 
old guest at a wedding party for two sad-faced clowns, 
who together, never won a round of anything but hard times. 
Come in, sheets are clean, 
fall down on me for one more year 
and we can blast another hole in ourselves without a sound. 
 

The Country Midwife:  A Day 
 

I bend over the woman. 
This is the third time between abortions. 
I dip a towel into a bucket of hot water 
and catch the first bit of blood, 
as the blue-pink dome of a head breaks through. 
A scraggy, red child comes out of her into my hands 
like warehouse ice sliding down a chute.

It's done, the stink of birth, Old Grizzly 
rears up on his hind legs in front of me 
and I want to go outside, 
but the air smells the same there too. 
The woman's left eye twitches 
and beneath her, a stain as orange as sunrise 
spreads over the sheet. 
I lift my short, blunt fingers to my face 
and I let her bleed, Lord, I let her bleed. 
  
The Hitchhiker

The Arizona wind dries out my nostrils 
and the heat of the sidewalk burns my shoes, 
as a woman drives up slowly. 
I get in, grinning at a face I do not like, 
but I slide my arm across the top of the seat 
and rest it lightly against her shoulder. 
We turn off into the desert, 
then I reach inside my pocket and touch the switchblade.

We stop, and as she moves closer to me, my hands ache, 
but somehow, I get the blade into her chest. 
I think a song:  "Everybody needs somebody, 
everybody needs somebody to love," 
as the black numerals 35 roll out of her right eye 
inside one small tear. 
Laughing, I snap my fingers.  Rape, murder, I got you 
in the sight of my gun.

I move off toward the street. 
My feet press down in it, 
familiar with the hot, soft asphalt 
that caresses them. 
The sun slips down into its cradle behind the mountains 
and it is hot, hotter than ever 
and I like it. 
  
 

The Root Eater 
 

The war has begun 
and I see the Root Eater bending, 
shifting his hands under the soil 
in search of the arthritic knuckles of trees. 
I see dazed flower stems 
pushing themselves back into the ground. 
I see turnips spinning endlessly 
on the blunt, bitten-off tips of their noses. 
I see the Root Eater going home on his knees, 
full of the ripe foundations of things, 
longing to send his seed up through his feet 
and out into the morning

but the stumps of trees heave themselves forward 
for the last march 
and the Root Eater waits, 
knowing he will be shoved, rootless, 
under the brown, scaly torso of the rock. 
  
  
 

Everything:  Eloy, Arizona, 1956 
 

Tin shack, where my baby sleeps on his back 
the way the hound taught him; 
highway, black zebra, with one white stripe; 
nickel in my pocket for chewing gum; 
you think you're all I've got. 
But when the 2 ton rolls to a stop 
and the driver gets out, 
I sit down in the shade and wave each finger, 
saving my whole hand till the last.

He's keys, tires, a fire lit in his belly 
in the diner up the road. 
I'm red toenails, tight blue halter, black slip. 
He's mine tonight.  I don't know him. 
He can only hurt me a piece at a time.

After a Long Time

the halves of the egg, impotence, 
slide into each other on waxed feet 
and the wait is over. 
The seam between my legs 
basted with hair tears apart, 
as your blue, flannel spoon slips inside, 
digs out the pieces of cracked shell 
and lays them on my thighs, 
like old china plates made too thin 
for holding anything but love.

To a Blossoming Pear Tree 
 

Beautiful natural blossoms, 
Pure delicate body, 
You stand without trembling. 
Little mist of fallen starlight, 
Perfect, beyond my reach, 
How I envy you. 
For if you could only listen, 
I would tell you something, 
Something human.

An old man 
Appeared to me once 
In the unendurable snow. 
He had a singe of white 
Beard on his face. 
He paused on a street in Minneapolis 
And stroked my face. 
Give it to me, he begged. 
I'll pay you anything.

I flinched.  Both terrified, 
We slunk away, 
Each in his own way dodging 
The cruel darts of the cold.

Beautiful natural blossoms, 
How could you possibly 
Worry or bother or care 
About the ashamed, hopeless 
Old man?  He was so near death 
He was willing to take 
Any love he could get, 
Even at the risk 
Of some mocking policeman 
Or some cute young wiseacre 
Smashing his dentures, 
Perhaps leading him on 
To a dark place and there 
Kicking him in his dead groin 
Just for the fun of it.

Young tree, unburdened 
By anything but your beautiful natural blossoms 
And dew, the dark 
Blood in my body drags me 
Down with my brother. 
  
Northern Pike 
 

All right.  Try this, 
Then.  Every body 
I know and care for, 
And every body 
Else is going 
To die in a loneliness 
I can't imagine and a pain 
I don't know.  We had 
To go on living.  We 
Untangled the net, we slit 
The body of this fish 
Open from the hinge of the tail 
To a place beneath the chin 
I wish I could sing of. 
I would just as soon we let 
The living go on living. 
An old poet whom we believe in 
Said the same thing, and so 
We paused among the dark cattails and prayed 
For the muskrats, 
For the ripples below their tails, 
For the little movements that we knew the crawdads were making under water, 
For the right-hand wrist of my cousin who is a policeman 
We prayed for the game warden's blindness. 
We prayed for the road home. 
We ate the fish. 
There must be something very beautiful in my body, 
I am so happy. 
  
  
A Blessing

Just off the highway to Rochester, Minnesota, 
Twilight bounds softly forth on the grass. 
And the eyes of those two Indian ponies 
Darken with kindness. 
They have come gladly out of the willows 
To welcome my friend and me. 
We step over the barbed wire into the pasture 
Where they have been grazing all day, alone. 
They ripple tensely, they can hardly contain their happiness 
That we have come. 
They bow shyly as wet swans.  They love each other. 
There is no loneliness like theirs. 
At home once more, they begin munching the young tufts of spring in the darkness. 
I would like to hold the slenderer one in my arms, 
For she has walked over to me 
And nuzzled my left hand. 
She is black and white, 
Her mane falls wild on her forehead, 
And the light breeze moves me to caress her long ear 
That is delicate as the skin over a girl's wrist. 
Suddenly I realize 
That if I stepped out of my body I would break 
Into blossom. 
  

Autumn Begins in Martins Ferry, Ohio

In the Shreve High football stadium, 
I think of Polacks nursing long beers in Tiltonsville, 
And gray faces of Negroes in the blast furnace at Benwood, 
And the ruptured night watchman of Wheeling Steel, 
Dreaming of heroes.

All the proud fathers are ashamed to go home. 
Their women cluck like starved pullets, 
Dying for love.

Therefore, 
Their sons grow suicidally beautiful 
At the beginning of October, 
And gallop terribly against each other's bodies. 
  
  
The Jewel

There is this cave 
In the air behind my body 
That nobody is going to touch: 
A cloister, a silence 
Closing around a blossom of fire. 
When I stand upright in the wind, 
My bones turn to dark emeralds. 
  
  
Lying in a Hammock at William Duffy's Farm in Pine Island, Minnesota 
 

Over my head, I see the bronze butterfly, 
Asleep on the black trunk, 
blowing like a leaf in green shadow. 
Down the ravine behind the empty house, 
The cowbells follow one another 
Into the distances of the afternoon. 
To my right, 
In a field of sunlight between two pines, 
The droppings of last year's horses 
Blaze up into golden stones. 
I lean back, as the evening darkens and comes on. 
A chicken hawk floats over, looking for home. 
I have wasted my life. 
  
  
Outside Fargo, North Dakota

Along the sprawled body of the derailed Great Northern freight car, 
I strike a match slowly and lift it slowly. 
No wind.

Beyond town, three heavy white horses 
Wade all the way to their shoulders 
In a silo shadow.

Suddenly the freight car lurches. 
The door slams back, a man with a flashlight 
Calls me good evening. 
I nod as I write good evening, lonely 
And sick for home. 
  

A Poem about George Doty in the Death House

Lured by the wall, and drawn 
To stare below the roof, 
Where pigeons nest aloof 
From prowling cats and men, 
I count the sash and bar 
Secured to granite stone, 
And note the daylight gone, 
Supper and silence near.

Close to the wall inside, 
Immured, empty of love, 
A man I have wondered of 
Lies patient, vacant-eye. 
A month and a day ago 
He stopped his car and found 
A girl on the darkening ground, 
And killed her in the snow.

Beside his cell, I am told, 
Hardy perennial bums 
Complain till twilight comes 
For hunger and for cold. 
They hardly know of a day 
That saw their hunger pass. 
Bred to the dark, their flesh 
Peacefully withers away.

The man who sits alone, 
He is the one for wonder, 
Who sways his fingers under 
The cleanly shaven chin, 
Who sees, in the shaving mirror 
Pinned to the barren wall, 
The uprooted ghost of all: 
The simple, easy terror.

Caught between sky and earth, 
Poor stupid animal, 
Stripped naked to the wall, 
He saw the blundered birth 
Of daemons beyond sound. 
Sick of the dark, he rose 
For love, and now he goes 
Back to the broken ground.

Now, as he grips the chain 
And holds the wall, to bear 
What no man ever bore, 
He hears the bums complain; 
But I mourn no soul but his, 
Not even the bums who die, 
Nor the homely girl whose cry 
Crumbled his pleading kiss. 
 



At the Executed Murderer's Grave

Why should we do this?  What good is it to us?  Above all, how can we do such a thing?  How can it possibly be done? 
--Freud

1. 
My name is James A. Wright, and I was born 
Twenty-five miles from this infected grave, 
In Martins Ferry, Ohio, where one slave 
To Hazel-Atlas Glass became my father. 
He tried to teach me kindness.  I return 
Only in memory now, aloof, unhurried, 
To dead Ohio, where I might lie buried, 
Had I not run away before my time. 
Ohio caught George Doty.  Clean as lime, 
His skull rots empty here.  Dying's the best 
Of all the arts men learn in a dead place. 
I walked here once.  I made my loud display, 
Leaning for language on a dead man's voice. 
Now sick of lies, I turn to face the past. 
I add my easy grievance to the rest:

2. 
Doty, if I confess I do not love you, 
Will you let me alone?  I burn for my own lies. 
The nights electrocute my fugitive, 
My mind.  I run like the bewildered mad 
At St. Clair Sanitarium, who lurk, 
Arch and cunning, under the maple trees, 
Pleased to be playing guilty after dark. 
Staring to bed, they croon self-lullabies. 
Doty, you make me sick.  I am not dead. 
I croon my tears at fifty cents per line.

3. 
Idiot, he demanded love from girls, 
And murdered one.  Also, he was a thief. 
He left two women, and a ghost with child. 
The hair, foul as a dog's upon his head, 
Made such revolting Ohio animals 
Fitter for vomit than a kind man's grief. 
I waste no pity on the dead that stink, 
And no love's lost between me and the crying 
Drunks of Belaire, Ohio, where police 
Kick at their kidneys till they die of drink. 
Christ may restore them whole, for all of me. 
Alive and dead, those giggling muckers who 
Saddled my nighmares thirty years ago 
Can do without my widely printed sighing. 
Over their pains with paid sincerity. 
I do not pity the dead, I pity the dying.

4. 
I pity myself, because a man is dead. 
If Belmont County killed him, what of me? 
His victims never loved him.  Why should we? 
And yet, nobody had to kill him either. 
It does no good to woo the grass, to veil 
The quicklime hole of a man's defeat and shame. 
Nature-lovers are gone.  To hell with them. 
I kick the clods away, and speak my name.

5. 
This grave's gash festers.  Maybe it will heal, 
When all are caught with what they had to do 
In fear of love, when every man stands still 
By the last sea, 
And the princes of the sea come down 
To lay away their robes, to judge the earth 
And its dead, and we dead stand undefended everywhere, 
And my bodies--father and child and unskilled criminal-- 
Ridiculously kneel to bare my scars, 
My sneaking crimes, to God's unpitying stars.

6. 
Staring politely, they will not mark my face 
From any murderer's, buried in this place. 
Why should they?  We are nothing but a man.

7. 
Doty, the rapist and the murderer, 
Sleeps in a ditch of fire, and cannot hear; 
And where, in earth or hell's unholy peace, 
Men's suicides will stop, God knows, not I. 
Angels and pebbles mock me under trees. 
Earth is a door I cannot even face. 
Order be damned, I do not want to die, 
Even to keep Belaire, Ohio, safe. 
The hackles on my neck are fear, not grief. 
(Open, dungeon!  Open, roof of the ground!) 
I hear the last sea in the Ohio grass, 
Heaving a tide of gray disastrousness. 
Wrinkles of winter ditch the rotted face 
Of Doty, killer, imbecile, and thief: 
Dirt of my flesh, defeated, underground. 
  

Saint Judas

When I went out to kill myself, I caught 
A pack of hoodlums beating up a man. 
Running to spare his suffering, I forgot 
My name, my number, how my day began, 
How soldiers milled around the garden stone 
And sang amusing songs; how all that day 
Their javelins measured crowds; how I alone 
Bargained the proper coins, and slipped away.

Banished from heaven, I found this victim beaten, 
Stripped, kneed, and left to cry.  Dropping my rope 
Aside, I ran, ignored the uniforms: 
Then I remembered bread my flesh had eaten, 
The kiss that ate my flesh.  Flayed without hope, 
I held the man for nothing in my arms. 
  
  

  
On the Skeleton of a Hound

Nightfall, that saw the morning-glories float
Tendril and string against the crumbling wall,
Nurses him now, his skeleton for grief,
His locks for comfort curled among the leaf.
Shuttles of moonlight weave his shadow tall,
Milkweed and dew flow upward to his throat.
Now catbird feathers plume the apple mound,
And starlings drowse to winter up the ground.
Thickened away from speech by fear, I move 
Around the body. Over his forepaws, steep
Declivities darken down the moonlight now,
And the long throat that bayed a year ago
Declines from summer. Flies would love to leap
Between his eyes and hum away the space
Between the ears, the hollow where a hare
Could hide; another jealous dog would tumble
The bones apart, angry, the shining crumble
Of a great body gleaming in the air;
Quivering pigeons foul his broken face.
I can imagine men who search the earth
For handy resurrections, overturn
The body of a beetle in its grave;
Whispering men digging for gods might delve
A pocket for these bones, then slowly burn
Twigs in the leaves, pray for another birth.
But I will turn my face away from this
Ruin of summer, collapse of fur and bone.
For once a white hare huddled up the grass,
The sparrows flocked away to see the race.
I stood on darkness, clinging to a stone,
I saw the two leaping alive on ice,
On earth, on leaf, humus and withered vine:
The rabbit splendid in a shroud of shade,
The dog carved on the sunlight, on the air,
Fierce and magnificent his rippled hair,
The cockleburs shaking around his head.
Then, suddenly, the hare leaped beyond pain
Out of the open meadow, and the hound
Followed the voiceless dancer to the moon,
To dark, to death, to other meadows where
Singing young women dance around a fire,
Where love reveres the living.

                                                    I alone
Scatter this hulk about the dampened ground;
And while the moon rises beyond me, throw
The ribs and spine out of their perfect shape.
For a last charm to the dead, I lift the skull
And toss it over the maples like a ball.
Strewn to the woods, now may that spirit sleep
That flamed over the ground a year ago.
I know the mole will heave a shinbone over,
The earthworm snuggle for a nap on paws,
The honest bees build honey in the head;
The earth knows how to handle the great dead
Who lived the body out, and broke its laws,
Knocked down a fence, tore up a field of clover.


Beginning

The moon drops one or two feathers into the fields.
The dark wheat listens.
Be still.
Now.
There they are, the moon's young, trying
Their wings.
Between trees, a slender woman lifts up the lovely shadow
Of her face, and now she steps into the air, now she is gone
Wholly, into the air.
I stand alone by an elder tree, I do not dare breathe
Or move.
I listen.
The wheat leans back toward its own darkness,
And I lean toward mine.


Trying to Pray

This time, I have left my body behind me, crying
In its dark thorns.
Still,
There are good things in this world.
It is dusk.
It is the good darkness
Of women's hands that touch loaves.
The spirit of a tree begins to move.
I touch leaves.
I close my eyes and think of water.

 

Depressed by a Book of Bad Poetry, I Walk Toward an Unused
Pasture and Invite the Insects to Join Me

Relieved, I let the book fall behind a stone.
I climb a slight rise of grass.
I do not want to disturb the ants
Who are walking single file up the fence post,
Carrying small white petals,
Casting shadows so frail that I can see through them.
I close my eyes for a moment and listen.
The old grasshoppers
Are tired, they leap heavily now,
Their thighs are burdened.
I want to hear them, they have clear sounds to make.
Then lovely, far off, a dark cricket begins
In the maple trees.


Small Frogs Killed On The Highway
Still,
I would leap too
Into the light,
If I had the chance.
It is everything, the wet green stalk of the field
On the other side of the road.
They crouch there, too, faltering in terror
And take strange wing. Many
Of the dead never moved, but many
Of the dead are alive forever in the split second
Auto headlights more sudden
Than their drivers know.
The drivers burrow backward into dank pools
Where nothing begets
Nothing.

Across the road, tadpoles are dancing
On the quarter thumbnail
Of the moon. They can't see,
Not yet.

Hook
I was only a young man
In those days. On that evening
The cold was so God damned
Bitter there was nothing.
Nothing. I was in trouble
With a woman, and there was nothing
There but me and dead snow.

I stood on the street corner
In Minneapolis, lashed
This way and that.
Wind rose from some pit,
Hunting me.
Another bus to Saint Paul
Would arrive in three hours,
If I was lucky.

Then the young Sioux
Loomed beside me, his scars
Were just my age.

Ain't got no bus here
A long time, he said.
You got enough money
To get home on?

What did they do
To your hand? I answered.
He raised up his hook into the terrible starlight
And slashed the wind.

Oh, that? he said.
I had a bad time with a woman. Here,
You take this.

Did you ever feel a man hold
Sixty-five cents
In a hook,
And place it
Gently
In your freezing hand?

I took it.
It wasn't the money I needed.
But I took it.

A Note Left in Jimmy Leonard's Shack

Near the dry river's water-mark we found
         Your brother Minnegan,
Flopped like a fish against the muddy ground.
Beany, the kid whose yellow hair turns green,
Told me to find you, even in the rain,
        And tell you he was drowned.

I hid behind the chassis on the bank,
         The wreck of someone's Ford:
I was afraid to come and wake you drunk:
You told me once the waking up was hard,
The daylight beating at you like a board.
        Blood in my stomach sank.

Beside, you told him never to go out
          Along the river-side
Drinking and singing, clattering about.
You might have thrown a rock at me and cried
I was to blame, I let him fall in the road
          And pitch down on his side.

Well, I'll get hell enough when I get home
          For coming up this far,
Leaving the note, and running as I came.
I'll go and tell my father where you are.
You'd better go find Minnegan before
         Policemen hear and come.

Beany went home, and I got sick and ran,
          You old son of a bitch.
You better hurry down to Minnegan;
He's drunk or dying now, I don't know which,
Rolled in the roots and garbage like a fish,
           The poor old man.



           Adam and Eve

I wanted to punch her right in the mouth and that's the truth.

After all, we had gotten from the station of the flickering glances
to the station of the hungry mouths,
from the shoreline of skirts and faded jeans
to the ocean of unencumbered skin,
from the perilous mountaintop of the apartment steps
to the sanctified valley of the bed--

the candle fluttering upon the dresser top, its little yellow blade
sending up its whiff of waxy smoke,
and I could smell her readiness
like a dank cloud above a field,

when at the crucial moment, the all-important moment,
the moment standing at attention,
she held her milk white hand agitatedly
over the entrance to her body and said No,
and my brain burst into flame.

If I couldn't sink myself in her like a dark spur
or dissolve into her like a clod thrown in a river,
can I go all the way in the saying, and say
I wanted to punch her right in the face?
Am I allowed to say that,
that I wanted to punch her right in her soft face?

Or is the saying just another instance of rapaciousness,
just another way of doing what I wanted then,
by saying it?

Is a man just an animal, and is a woman not an animal?
Is the name of the animal power?
Is it true that the man wishes to see the woman
hurt with her own pleasure

and the woman wishes to see the expression on the man's face
of someone falling from great height,
that the woman thrills with the power of her weakness
and the man is astonished by the weakness of his power?

Is the sexual chase a hunt where the animal inside
drags the human down
into a jungle made of vowels,
hormonal undergrowth of sweat and hair,

or is this an obsolete idea
lodged like a fossil
in the brain of the ape
who lives inside the man?

Can the fossil be surgically removed
or dissolved, or redesigned
so the man can be a human being, like a woman?

Does the woman see the man as a house
where she might live in safety,
and does the man see the woman as a door
through which he might escape
the hated prison of himself,

and when the door is locked,
does he hate the door instead?
Does he learn to hate all doors?

I've seen rain turn into snow then back to rain,
and I've seen making love turn into fucking
then back to making love,
and no one covered up their faces out of shame,
no one rose and walked into the lonely maw of night.

But where was there, in fact, to go?
Are some things better left unsaid?
Shall I tell you her name?
Can I say it again,
that I wanted to punch her right in the face?

Until we say the truth, there can be no tenderness.
As long as there is desire, we will not be safe.




Dickhead
 

To whomever taught me the word dickhead,
I owe a debt of thanks.
It gave me a way of being in the world of men
when I most needed one,

when I was pale and scrawny,
naked, goosefleshed
as a plucked chicken

in a supermarket cooler, a poor
forked thing stranded in the savage
universe of puberty, where wild

jockstraps flew across the steamy
skies of locker rooms,
and everybody fell down laughing

at jokes I didn’t understand.
But dickhead was a word as dumb
and democratic as a hammer, an object

you could pick up in your hand,
and swing,
saying dickhead this and dickhead that,

a song that meant the world
was yours enough at least
to bang on like a garbage can,

and knowing it, and having that
beautiful ugliness always
cocked and loaded in my mind,

protected me and calmed me like a psalm. 
Now I have myself become
a beautiful ugliness,

and my weakness is a fact
so well established that
it makes me calm,

and I am calm enough 
to be grateful for the lives I
never have to live again;

but I remember all the bad old days
back in the world of men,
when everything was serious, mysterious, scary,

hairier and bigger than I was;
I recall when flesh
was what I hated, feared

and was excluded from:
Hardly knowing what I did,
or what would come of it,

I made a word my friend.




Texaco

The nozzle of the gas pump
plunged into the flank of the car
like the curved beak of a predatory bird

looks like it is drinking
or maybe I'm light-headed
from the fumes

or from the slanted light
of Thursday afternoon.
—Still, it is a powerful moment

when I squeeze the trigger of the handle
and feel, beneath the stained cement,
the deep shudder and convulsion

of the gasoline begin
its plunging rush in my direction.
Out of the guts of the earth,

filtered through sand and blood
down the long hose of history
towards the very nipple of this moment:

—the mechanical ticking of the pump,
the sound of my car drinking—
filling my tank with a necessary story

about the road, how we have
to have it to go down;
the whole world construed around

this singular, solitary act
as if I myself had conjured it
from some strange thirst.




Lie Down with a Man
In those days I thought I had to 
do everything I was afraid of,
so I lay down with a man.

It was one item on a list--
sleeping in the graveyard, under the full moon,
not looking away from the burned girl's stricken face,
strapping myself into the catapult
of some electric blue pill.

It was the seventies, a whole generation of us
was more than willing to chainsaw through
the branch that we were sitting on
to see what falling felt like--bump bump bump.

Knowing the worse about yourself
seemed like self-improvement then,
and suffering was adventure.

So I lay down with a man,
which I really don't remember
except that it was humorless.

Curtains fluttered in the breeze
from the radio's black grill. Van Morrison
filled up the room like astral aftershave.

I lay my mass of delusions
next to his mass of delusions
in the dark room where I struggled
with the old adversary, myself


--in the form, this time, of a body--
someplace between heaven and earth,
two things I was afraid of.




The Replacement


And across the country I know
they are replacing my brother's brain
with the brain of a man;

one gesture, one word, one neuron at a time
with surgical precision
they are teaching him to hook his thumbs
into his belt, to iron his mouth as flat
as the horizon, and make his eyes
reflective as a piece of tin.

It is a kind of cooking
the male child undergoes:
to toughen him, he is dipped repeatedly
in insult--peckerwood, shitbag, faggot,
pussy, dicksucker--until spear points
will break against his epidermis,
until his is impossible to disappoint.

Then he walks out into the street
ready for a game of corporate poker
with a hard-on for the Dow-Jones
like this hormonal language I am
flexing like a bicep
to show who's boss.

But I'm not the boss.
And there is nothing I can do to stop it,
and would I if I could?
What else is there for him to be
except a man?
If they fail,
he stumbles through his life
like an untied shoe.
If they succeed, he may become
something even I can't love.

Already the photograph I have of him
is out of date
but in it he is standing by the pool
without a shirt: too young, too white, too weak,
with feelings he is too inept to hide
splashed over his face--

goofy, proud, shy,
he's smiling at the camera
as if he were under the illusion
that someone loved him so well
they would not ever ever ever
turn him over to the world.


Why the Young Men Are So Ugly


They have little tractors in their blood
and all day the tractors climb up and down
inside their arms and legs, their
collarbones and heads.

That is why they yell and scream and slam the barbells
down into their clanking slots,
making the metal ring like sledgehammers on iron,
like dungeon prisoners rattling their chains.

That is why they shriek their tires at the stopsign,
why they turn the base up on the stereo
until it shakes the traffic light, until it
dryhumps the eardrum of the crossing guard.

Testosterone is a drug,
and they say No, No, No until
they are overwhelmed and punch
their buddy in the face for joy,

or make a joke about gravy and bottomless holes
to a middle-aged waitress who is gently
setting down the plate in front of them.

If they are grotesque, if
what they say and do is often nothing more
than a kind of psychopathic fart,

it is only because of the tractors,
the tractors in their blood,
revving their engines, chewing up the turf
inside their arteries and veins
It is the testosterone tractor

constantly climbing the mudhill of the world
and dragging the young man behind it
by a chain around his leg.
In the stink and the noise, in the clouds
of filthy exhaust

is where they live. It is the tractors
that make them
what they are. While they make being a man
look like a disease.
 

America

Then one of the students with blue hair and a tongue stud
Says that America is for him a maximum-security prison

Whose walls are made of RadioShacks and Burger Kings, and MTV episodes
Where you can't tell the show from the commercials,

And as I consider how to express how full of shit I think he is,
He says that even when he's driving to the mall in his Isuzu

Trooper with a gang of his friends, letting rap music pour over them
Like a boiling Jacuzzi full of ballpeen hammers, even then he feels

Buried alive, captured and suffocated in the folds
Of the thick satin quilt of America

And I wonder if this is a legitimate category of pain,
or whether he is just spin doctoring a better grade,

And then I remember that when I stabbed my father in the dream last night,
It was not blood but money

That gushed out of him, bright green hundred-dollar bills
Spilling from his wounds, and—this is the weird part—,

He gasped, "Thank god—those Ben Franklins were
Clogging up my heart—

And so I perish happily,
Freed from that which kept me from my liberty"—

Which is when I knew it was a dream, since my dad
Would never speak in rhymed couplets,

And I look at the student with his acne and cell phone and phony ghetto clothes
And I think, "I am asleep in America too,

And I don't know how to wake myself either,"
And I remember what Marx said near the end of his life:

"I was listening to the cries of the past,
When I should have been listening to the cries of the future."

But how could he have imagined 100 channels of 24-hour cable
Or what kind of nightmare it might be

When each day you watch rivers of bright merchandise run past you
And you are floating in your pleasure boat upon this river

Even while others are drowning underneath you
And you see their faces twisting in the surface of the waters

And yet it seems to be your own hand
Which turns the volume higher?

 

Rap Music

Twenty-six men trapped in a submarine
are pounding on the walls with a metal pipe,
shouting what they'll do when they get out.
Or they are rolled up in a rug in the back
of a rug truck that has wrecked.

No, it's the car pulled up next to mine in traffic
with the windows rolled down and the sound turned up
so loud it puts everything in italics: enough to make the asphalt thump
and the little leaves of shrubbery
in front of the nice brick houses quake.

I don't know what's going on inside that portable torture chamber,
but I have a bad suspicion
there's a lot of dead white people in there

on a street lit by burning police cars
where a black man is striking the head of a white one
again and again with a brick,
then lifting the skull to drink blood from the hole—

But that's what art is for, isn't it?
It's about giving expression to the indignation—
it's for taking the in out of the inhibitchin;
so maybe my ears are just a little hysterical
or maybe my fear is a little historical

and you know, I'd like to form an exploratory committee
to investigate that question—
and I'd like that committee to produce a documentary
called The Sweet Sounds of Afro-American,

but all this ugly noise is getting in the way,
and what I'm not supposed to say
is that Black for me is a country
more foreign than China or Vagina,
more alarming than going down Niagara on Viagra—

and it makes me feel stupid when I get close
like a little white dog on the edge of a big dark woods
I'm not supposed to look directly into

and there's this pounding noise
like a heartbeat full of steroids,
like a thousand schizophrenic Shakespeares
killing themselves at high volume—

this tangled roar
that has to be shut up or blown away or sealed off
or actually mentioned and entered.

 

Reading Moby-Dick at 30,000 Feet

At this height, Kansas
is just a concept,
a checkerboard design of wheat and corn

no larger than the foldout section
of my neighbor's travel magazine.
At this stage of the journey

I would estimate the distance
between myself and my own feelings
is roughly the same as the mileage

from Seattle to New York,
so I can lean back into the upholstered interval
between Muzak and lunch,

a little bored, a little old and strange.
I remember, as a dreamy
backyard kind of kid,

tilting up my head to watch
those planes engrave the sky
in lines so steady and so straight

they implied the enormous concentration
of good men,
but now my eyes flicker

from the in-flight movie
to the stewardess's pantyline,
then back into my book,

where men throw harpoons at something
much bigger and probably
better than themselves,

wanting to kill it,
wanting to see great clouds of blood erupt
to prove that they exist.

Imagine being born and growing up,
rushing through the world for sixty years
at unimaginable speeds.

Imagine a century like a room so large,
a corridor so long
you could travel for a lifetime

and never find the door,
until you had forgotten
that such a thing as doors exist.

Better to be on board the Pequod,
with a mad one-legged captain
living for revenge.

Better to feel the salt wind
spitting in your face,
to hold your sharpened weapon high,

to see the glisten
of the beast beneath the waves.
What a relief it would be

to hear someone in the crew
cry out like a gull,
Oh Captain, Captain!

Where are we going now?       



February

This is the second month of the year I turn thirty-seven.
Already the weather is warming in southeast Texas, rushing
The weeks along; the trees have to work to keep up. One day
I'll look over my head and the elm will be leafed out,
And then it will be summer. And probably I'll be working
On my birthday, probably teaching a couple of classes,
And I'll say to myself, it's just as well, who needs to think about
Turning thirty-seven, and I'll go back to my regular life,
Smiling and talking to students in the hallway,
Breaking a sweat on the short walk from the door
To the parked car, rolling all the windows down
But not without glancing at the sky for stormclouds,
Because a storm will be breaking every day then after noon,
Lasting about an hour, and subsiding back to sun. You learn
Such things about the weather when you've lived in a place
For a while. Or maybe it's really what some people say,
It's like that everywhere; I haven't been anywhere near
Everywhere, and maybe I'll never make it.
But there were years when I liked to search out danger,
Late nights I learned each secret worn-out cars
Bouncing through the ruts of logging roads could take me to.
I learned about love like that; the full moon pierced
The windshield like a spike and I knew it was love
When the strong, agile boy above me sighed
And pushed deeper inside me. I knew it was love
When I didn't want to close my eyes. I learned about trouble
And I knew it was trouble when I dropped out of high school
My senior year and took to prowling the roads with boys;
We took to shooting heroin under the spring sky,
We'd lie back together in the roadside grass and all let go
Of our suffering, we were having a hard time growing up,
It felt good to do a terrible thing together.
No one could find us there. No one was looking.
We would've counted the stars, but that was work.
Instead we talked about loving one another, and I guess
You'd say it was the heroin talking, but we thought we felt it,
We were free together, we knew how we were when no one
Could know us because we were doing evil. I took myself
Far from those foothills the first chance I could.
I didn't find out what became of my friends, it looked like
Some of them were headed for prison; I loved them once
But I wouldn't love them now, and I didn't want to
Think about mixing love and trouble, the trick I learned
And never gave up; I just got older, and stopped
Getting into the trouble of the young; I discovered
The trouble of the older.
                                     This is the second month
Of the year I turn thirty-seven. Already the little fists
Of leaves are forming inside the knotted ends of twigs
All over Houston. The cold weather is over. This winter
Again there was no freeze. And tonight it's very late,
And it's Sunday, and no cars pass on the big road
By the house, but out there in the night
Some kids about seventeen are doing terrible things
They'll get by with, and grow out of, and remember
The way they'll remember what love felt like at first,
Before it stopped being the surest path to ruination,
Before it had done the worst it could and passed away.
And to them it's as if those who lived this life before them
Moved with the jerky speeded-up gestures of characters
In old-fashioned movies, their expressions intense
And exaggerated; they roll their eyes and loll their tongues
When the heroin hits their blood. It's as if the beauty
Of evil lives only in the present, where the drop of dope
Clinging to the tip of the stainless steel point
Catches the light like dew; and it doesn't matter
That the light falls from a streetlamp with a short in it,
And the impatient boy with the syringe in his hand
Will touch the drop back into the spoon
So as not to waste it. It's his instinct telling him
How much it means to live this now, before he knows
Better, while he still has a chance to survive it.
It's the moon over his head with its polished horns
That would slip through his skin if he touched them.
It's the trees leaping to life in his blood, greenness
Unfurling so hard it almost bursts his heart.


The Accident

I had no business there in the first place— 
I'm putting on weight—but the counter help was all smiles,
Having survived the lunch hour crunch. My husband and I
Ordered burgers and fries; I was in front, so I chose
A seat on the far side, back to the window.
I picked off two thin rings of onion; the fries were limp.
Something about the car, maybe, both of us
Interested, me a little bitchy, so it was almost the way you turn
Instinctively, say from a spider web in a darkened hall,
How I looked across the restaurant and found her face,
Left cheekbone swollen to a baseball, the same eye blackened,
Heavy make-up, front tooth out in a jack-o-lantern grin
As she tried to look friendly to the young waitress
Her husband motioned over. He rested one hand
On his wife's shoulder, solicitous, the other waving
A lit cigarette, a small man, dark-haired, now laughing aloud,
Glancing at the uncombed head of his beaten wife again
Turning her back to the room, though not crowded,
All suddenly staring, reading the last few hours
Of those lives in a horror of recognition.
She cupped her hand shading the side of her face,
You could see lumps of vertebrae through her t-shirt,
And he kept on talking, smiling at her, with a slight tilt
Of his head, as if saying poor baby, something happened to her,
Good thing I'm here to take care of her, a car wreck,
A bad one, a smash-up, and all of us looked
And knew better. At the table with them was a little girl.
The man, the woman, the five-year-old daughter— 
Even the man and the beaten woman had the same features,
As people do who have lived together for years. I couldn't see
The child's face. He was jotting a note on a small pad,
The waitress's name, as if to write a letter praising
Her fine service, and she smiled through her horror, she
Hardly more than sixteen, with clear pale skin. Next to us
A woman in permed hair and suit rose to leave, lunch untouched,
With her daughter. She carried a leather legal-sized folder.
We left soon after, heads turned, not looking,
Because sometime the man and woman would go
Home to the privacy of a city apartment, no neighbors
Home all day to hear, but first I said, in the restaurant,
Across the room where he couldn't hear, If I had a gun 
I'd blow his brains out, and I thought of that moment
Familiar from movies, the round black hole in the forehead
Opening, the back of the skull blowing out frame by frame
Like a baseball smashing a window, but no one near
Would've even been bloodied because no one was standing anywhere
Near him, his hand on the beaten woman's shoulder
Might as well've been yards from his body.

I was taught not to write about this. But my teacher,
A man with a reputation who hoped I would make
Good, never knew that I, too, have been hit in the face by a man.
He knew only my clumsy efforts to cast what happened
Into "characters," and he loved the beauty in poetry.
Maybe what I had written was awkward. Maybe my teacher
Guessed what happened and forbade me writing it
For some good reason, he cared for me, or he feared
He too might've slapped my face, because I, like the character
In that first effort, was bitching to the heavens and a redneck
Boyfriend, and we argued outdoors, near a stack of light wood
Used to kindle the stove like everyone has
In the foothills of North Carolina. That day I railed
Like a caricature of a bitching redneck woman,
Hands on hips, sometimes a clenched fist, I was
Bitching, I think, as he planned some stupid ting
I hated, like fishing, pitching horseshoes, driving
To visit his mother on Sundays, her tiny house
Tangled in dirt roads, where she sat in the kitchen dipping snuff.
Whatever he wanted to do was harmless,
But so was my shrieking, my furious pleading, an endless loop
Inside my head rolling I want to be rid of him, and he slapped me
Across my open mouth, I felt myself shut up and staggered,
Because he was a large man, and I was a large woman,
He had to make sure he hit me pretty hard,
Both of us strong and mad as hell, early
One Saturday morning, when he wanted to do what he wanted to do
And I wanted to keep him from it. He slapped me
Twice, open-handed, knocking me, open-handed, to my knees,
In kindling, so my knees were scraped bloody and my hand
Closed on a foot and a half of inch-thick pine, and I stumbled up,
Swinging, my eyes popping wide, till I brought it down
Hard across his shoulder, I saw how the rage on his face
Flashed to fear, just that quick, a second, or less,
And he turned to run but he made the wrong choice,
If he'd gone to the road I wouldn've followed, but he ran
Inside my "duplex" apartment, an old country house
Cut in two. So I cornered him upstairs and knocked him out.
It was simple. He fell so hard, I thought I've killed him;
I was throwing my clothes in a paper bag when I heard him
Sobbing. In the bathroom mirror I found the black eye and lop-sided lip,
And it seemed as if I might still take it back, the last ten minutes,
The chase, the beating, the high-pitched screaming,
The stubborn need to go fishing. But the make-up I disdained
In those years—I had just turned twenty—didn't do much
To cover the bruises. His face was clear. The knot on his head
Stopped swelling under ice. It was easy to tell him
To get the hell out and only regret it every other minute
Since there were no children, no marriage, even,
And I was young and believed I had proven
I was strong. I had beaten a man to his knees.
Months later I would go to college and stay safely there for years,
Not letting on to anyone the terrible things I'd done, until I wrote
That clumsy poem with the unbelievable characters, and now I've tried
To do it again, this time with different characters, I've defied
My teacher, who meant for me to learn to write well,
Who meant for the world to think well of me,
And I am not sorry. If he asked why I would say
I had to do it, and that lie would be like the lie of living
Without telling, till one day seeing the beaten face,
What scared me most, the missing tooth, the tangled hair, the vertebrae,
The daughter. There is no use thinking what it means
About me to say this: I am not sorry. I might have killed
That man. I might have blown his brains out.               
 


 My Papa's Waltz 
 

The whiskey on your breath 
Could make a small boy dizzy; 
But I hung on like death: 
Such waltzing was not easy.

We romped until the pans 
Slid from the kitchen shelf; 
My mother's countenance 
Could not unfrown itself.

The hand that held my wrist 
Was battered on one knuckle; 
At every step you missed 
My right ear scraped a buckle.

You beat time on my head 
With a palm caked hard by dirt, 
Then waltzed me off to bed 
Still clinging to your shirt.
 

Child on Top of a Greenhouse

The wind billowing out the seat of my britches,
My feet crackling splinters of glass and dried putty,
The half-grown chrysanthemums staring up like accusers,
Up through the streaked glass, flashing with sunlight,
A few white clouds all rushing eastward,
A line of elms plunging and tossing like horses,
And everyone, everyone pointing up and shouting!

Cuttings (Later)

This urge, wrestle, resurrection of dry sticks,
Cut stems struggling to put down feet,
What saint strained so much,
Rose on such lopped limbs to a new life?
I can hear, underground, that sucking and sobbing,
In my veins, in my bones I feel it—
The small waters seeping upward,
The tight grains parting at last.
When sprouts break out,
Slippery as fish,
I quail, lean to beginnings, sheath-wet. 



The Meadow Mouse

1.

In a shoe box stuffed in an old nylon stocking
Sleeps the baby mouse I found in the meadow,
Where he trembled and shook beneath a stick
Till I caught him up by the tail and brought him in,
Cradled in my hand,
A little quaker, the whole body of him trembling,
His absurd whiskers sticking out like a cartoon-mouse,
His feet like small leaves,
Little lizard-feet,
Whitish and spread wide when he tried to struggle away,
Wriggling like a minuscule puppy.

Now he's eaten his three kinds of cheese and drunk from his
bottle-cap watering-trough—
So much he just lies in one corner,
His tail curled under him, his belly big
As his head; his bat-like ears
Twitching, tilting toward the least sound.

Do I imagine he no longer trembles
When I come close to him?
He seems no longer to tremble.

2.

But this morning the shoe-box house on the back porch is empty.
Where has he gone, my meadow mouse,
My thumb of a child that nuzzled in my palm? —
To run under the hawk's wing,
Under the eye of the great owl watching from the elm-tree,
To live by courtesy of the shrike, the snake, the tom-cat.

I think of the nestling fallen into the deep grass,
The turtle gasping in the dusty rubble of the highway,
The paralytic stunned in the tub, and the water rising,—
All things innocent, hapless, forsaken.


The Geranium

When I put her out, once, by the garbage pail,
She looked so limp and bedraggled,
So foolish and trusting, like a sick poodle,
Or a wizened aster in late September,
I brought her back in again
For a new routine—
Vitamins, water, and whatever
Sustenance seemed sensible
At the time: she'd lived
So long on gin, bobbie pins, half-smoked cigars, dead beer,
Her shriveled petals falling
On the faded carpet, the stale
Steak grease stuck to her fuzzy leaves.
(Dried-out, she creaked like a tulip.)

The things she endured!—
The dumb dames shrieking half the night
Or the two of us, alone, both seedy,
Me breathing booze at her,
She leaning out of her pot toward the window.

Near the end, she seemed almost to hear me—
And that was scary—
So when that snuffling cretin of a maid
Threw her, pot and all, into the trash-can,
I said nothing.

But I sacked the presumptuous hag the next week,
I was that lonely.

 

Dolor

I have known the inexorable sadness of pencils,
Neat in their boxes, dolor of pad and paper weight,
All the misery of manilla folders and mucilage,
Desolation in immaculate public places,
Lonely reception room, lavatory, switchboard,
The unalterable pathos of basin and pitcher,
Ritual of multigraph, paper-clip, comma,
Endless duplicaton of lives and objects.
And I have seen dust from the walls of institutions,
Finer than flour, alive, more dangerous than silica,
Sift, almost invisible, through long afternoons of tedium,
Dropping a fine film on nails and delicate eyebrows,
Glazing the pale hair, the duplicate grey standard faces.

 

 

Root Cellar
Nothing would sleep in that cellar, dank as a ditch,
Bulbs broke out of boxes hunting for chinks in the dark,
Shoots dangled and drooped,
Lolling obscenely from mildewed crates,
Hung down long yellow evil necks, like tropical snakes.
And what a congress of stinks!
Roots ripe as old bait,
Pulpy stems, rank, silo-rich,
Leaf-mold, manure, lime, piled against slippery planks.
Nothing would give up life:
Even the dirt kept breathing a small breath.


Apostle Town 
 

After your death. 
It was windy every day. 
Every day. 
Opposed us like a wall. 
We went. 
Shouting sideways at one another. 
Along the road. 
It was useless. 
The spaces between us. 
Got hard. 
They are empty spaces. 
And yet they are solid. 
And black and grievous. 
As gaps between the teeth. 
Of an old woman. 
You knew years ago. 
When she was. 
Beautiful the nerves pouring around in her like palace fire. 
  
 

Love Town

She ran in. 
Wet corn. 
Yellow braid. 
Down her back. 
 

Town of the Sound of a Twig Breaking

Their faces I thought were knives. 
The way they pointed them at me. 
And waited. 
A hunter is someone who listens. 
So hard to his prey it pulls the weapon. 
Out of his hand and impales. 
Itself. 
  
 

Town of Spring Once Again

"Spring is always like what it used to be." 
Said an old Chinese man. 
Rain hissed down the windows. 
Longings from a great distance. 
Reached us. 
  
 

Bride Town

Hanging on the daylight black. 
As an overcoat with no man in it one cold bright. 
Noon the Demander was waiting for me. 
  
 

Town on the Way through God's Woods

Tell me. 
Have you ever seen woods so. 
Deep so. 
Every tree a word does your heart stop? 
Once I saw a cloud over Bolivia so deep. 
Mountains were cowering do you ever? 
Look in so quick you see the secret. 
Word inside the word? 
As in an abandoned railway car. 
One winter afternoon I saw. 
The word for "God's woods." 



The Day Lady Died

 It is 12:20 in New York a Friday 
three days after Bastille day, yes 
it is 1959 and I go get a shoeshine 
because I will get off the 4:19 in Easthampton 
at 7:15 and then go straight to dinner 
and I don’t know the people who will feed meI walk up the muggy street beginning to sun 
and have a hamburger and a malted and buy 
an ugly NEW WORLD WRITING to see what the poets 
in Ghana are doing these days 
                                                         I go on to the bank 
and Miss Stillwagon (first name Linda I once heard) 
doesn’t even look up my balance for once in her life 
and in the GOLDEN GRIFFIN I get a little Verlaine 
for Patsy with drawings by Bonnard although I do 
Brendan Behan’s new play or Le Balcon or Les Negres 
of Genet, but I don’t, I stick with Verlaine 
after practically going to sleep with quandarinessand for Mike I just stroll into the PARK LANE 
Liquor Store and ask for a bottle of Strega and 
then I go back where I came from to 6th Avenue 
and the tobacconist in the Ziegfeld Theatre and 
casually ask for a carton of Gauloises and a carton 
of Picayunes, and a NEW YORK POST with her face on itand I am sweating a lot by now and thinking of 
leaning on the john door in the 5 SPOT 
while she whispered a song along the keyboard 
to Mal Waldron and everyone and I stopped breathing


 

Why I am Not A Painter

I am not a painter, I am a poet. 
Why? I think I would rather be 
a painter, but I am not. Well,
for instance, Mike Goldberg 
is starting a painting. I drop in. 
"Sit down and have a drink" be 
says. I drink; we drink. I look 
up. "You have SARDINES in it." 
"Yes, it needed something there."

"Oh." I go and the days go by 
and I drop in again. The painting 
is going on, and I go, and the days 
go by. I drop in. The painting is 
finished. "Where's SARDINES?" 
All that's left is just
letters, "It was too much," Mike says.

But me? One day I am thinking of 
a color: orange. I write a line 
about orange. Pretty soon it is a 
whole page of words, not lines. 
Then another page. There should be 
so much more, not of orange, of 
words, of how terrible orange is 
and life. Days go by. It is even in 
prose, I am a real poet. My poem 
is finished and I haven't mentioned 
orange yet. It's twelve poems, I call 
it ORANCES. And one day in a gallery 
I see Mike's painting, called SARDINES. 
 

Poem

Lana Turner has collapsed!
I was trotting along and suddenly
it started raining and snowing
and you said it was hailing
but hailing hits you on the head 
hard so it was really snowing and
raining and I was in such a hurry
to meet you but the traffic
was acting exactly like the sky
and suddenly I see a headline
LANA TURNER HAS COLLAPSED!
there is no snow in Hollywood
there is no rain in California
I have been to lots of parties
and acted perfectly disgraceful
but I never actually collapsed
oh Lana Turner we love you get up

 

The Eager Note on My Door Said Call Me

The eager note on my door said "Call me,"
call when you get in!" so I quickly threw
a few tangerines into my overnight bag,
straightened my eyelids and shoulders, and

headed straight for the door. It was autumn
by the time I got around the corner, oh all
unwilling to be either pertinent or bemused, but
the leaves were brighter than grass on the sidewalk!

Funny, I thought, that the lights are on this late
and the hall door open; still up at this hour, a
champion jai-alai player like himself? Oh fie!
for shame! What a host, so zealous! And he was

there in the hall, flat on a sheet of blood that
ran down the stairs. I did appreciate it. There are few
hosts who so thoroughly prepare to greet a guest
only casually invited, and that several months ago. 

 

To the Harbormaster

I wanted to be sure to reach you;
though my ship was on the way it got caught
in some moorings. I am always tying up
and then deciding to depart. In storms and
at sunset, with the metallic coils of the tide
around my fathomless arms, I am unable
to understand the forms of my vanity
or I am hard alee with my Polish rudder
in my hand and the sun sinking. To
you I offer my hull and the tattered cordage
of my will. The terrible channels where
the wind drives me against the brown lips
of the reeds are not all behind me. Yet
I trust the sanity of my vessel; and
if it sinks it may well be in answer
to the reasoning of the eternal voices,
the waves which have kept me from reaching you. 

 

Song

Is it dirty
does it look dirty
that's what you think of in the city

does it just seem dirty
that's what you think of in the city
you don't refuse to breathe do you

someone comes along with a very bad character
he seems attractive. is he really. yes. very
he's attractive as his character is bad. is it. yes

that's what you think of in the city
run your finger along your no-moss mind
that's not a thought that's soot

and you take a lot of dirt off someone
is the character less bad. no. it improves constantly
you don't refuse to breathe do you 

 

As Planned

After the first glass of vodka
you can accept just about anything
of life even your own mysteriousness
you think it is nice that a box
of matches is purple and brown and is called
La Petite and comes from Sweden
for they are words that you know and that
is all you know words not their feelings
or what they mean and you write because
you know them not because you understand them
because you don't you are stupid and lazy
and will never be great but you do
what you know because what else is there?


Music


If I rest for a moment near The Equestrian
pausing for a liver sausage sandwich in the Mayflower Shoppe,
that angel seems to be leading the horse into Bergdorf's
and I am naked as a table cloth, my nerves humming.
Close to the fear of war and the stars which have disappeared.
I have in my hands only 35c, it's so meaningless to eat!
and gusts of water spray over the basins of leaves
like the hammers of a glass pianoforte. If I seem to you
to have lavender lips under the leaves of the world,
I must tighten my belt.
It's like a locomotive on the march, the season
of distress and clarity
and my door is open to the evenings of midwinter's
lightly falling snow over the newspapers.
Clasp me in your handkerchief like a tear, trumpet
of early afternoon! in the foggy autumn.
As they're putting up the Christmas trees on Park Avenue
I shall see my daydreams walking by with dogs in blankets,
put to some use before all those coloured lights come on!
But no more fountains and no more rain,
and the stores stay open terribly late.


A Step Away From Them

It's my lunch hour, so I go 
for a walk among the hum-colored
cabs. First, down the sidewalk 
where laborers feed their dirty
glistening torsos sandwiches 
and Coca-Cola, with yellow helmets 
on. They protect them from falling 
bricks, I guess. Then onto the 
avenue where skirts are flipping
above heels and blow up over 
grates. The sun is hot, but the 
cabs stir up the air. I look 
at bargains in wristwatches. There 
are cats playing in sawdust.
On 
to Times Square, where the sign 
blows smoke over my head, and higher
the waterfall pours lightly. A 
Negro stands in a doorway with a 
toothpick, languorously agitating
A blonde chorus girl clicks: he 
smiles and rubs his chin. Everything 
suddenly honks: it is 12:40 of 
a Thursday.

Neon in daylight is a 
great pleasure, as Edwin Denby would 
write, as are light bulbs in daylight. 
I stop for a cheeseburger at JULIET'S 
CORNER. Giulietta Maina, wife of 
Federico Fellini, é bell' attrice. 
And chocolate malted. A lady in 
foxes on such a day puts her poodle 
in a cab.

There are several Puerto 
Ricans on the avenue today, which 
makes it beautiful and warm. First 
Bunny died, then John Latouche, 
then Jackson Pollock. But is the 
earth as full of life was full, of them? 
And one has eaten and one walks, 
past the magazines with nudes 
and the posters for BULLFIGHT and 
the Manhatten Storage Warehouse, 
which they'll soon tear down. I 
used to think they had the Armory
Show there.

A glass of papaya juice 
and back to work. My heart is in my 
pocket, it is Poems by Pierre Reverdy. 
 

Autobiographia Literaria

When I was a child
I played by myself in a 
corner of the schoolyard
all alone.

I hated dolls and I
hated games, animals were
not friendly and birds 
flew away.

If anyone was looking 
for me I hid behind a 
tree and cried out "I am
an orphan."

And here I am, the 
center of all beauty! 
writing these poems!
Imagine!

 

 

Steps

How funny you are today New York
like Ginger Rogers in Swingtime
and St. Bridget's steeple leaning a little to the left

here I have just jumped out of a bed full of V-days
(I got tired of D-days) and blue you there still
accepts me foolish and free
all I want is a room up there
and you in it
and even the traffic halt so thick is a way
for people to rub up against each other
and when their surgical appliances lock
they stay together
for the rest of the day (what a day)
I go by to check a slide and I say
that painting's not so blue

where's Lana Turner
she's out eating
and Garbo's backstage at the Met
everyone's taking their coat off
so they can show a rib-cage to the rib-watchers
and the park's full of dancers with their tights and shoes
in little bags
who are often mistaken for worker-outers at the West Side Y
why not
the Pittsburgh Pirates shout because they won
and in a sense we're all winning
we're alive

the apartment was vacated by a gay couple
who moved to the country for fun
they moved a day too soon
even the stabbings are helping the population explosion
though in the wrong country
and all those liars have left the UN
the Seagram Building's no longer rivalled in interest
not that we need liquor (we just like it)

and the little box is out on the sidewalk
next to the delicatessen
so the old man can sit on it and drink beer
and get knocked off it by his wife later in the day
while the sun is still shining

oh god it's wonderful
to get out of bed
and drink too much coffee
and smoke too many cigarettes
and love you so much 

 

My Heart

I'm not going to cry all the time
nor shall I laugh all the time,
I don't prefer one "strain" to another.
I'd have the immediacy of a bad movie,
not just a sleeper, but also the big,
overproduced first-run kind. I want to be
at least as alive as the vulgar. And if
some aficionado of my mess says "That's
not like Frank!", all to the good! I
don't wear brown and grey suits all the time,
do I? No. I wear workshirts to the opera,
often. I want my feet to be bare,
I want my face to be shaven, and my heart--
you can't plan on the heart, but
the better part of it, my poetry, is open.

 

Meditations in an Emergency

Am I to become profligate as if I were a blonde? Or religious as if I were French?

Each time my heart is broken it makes me feel more adventurous (and how the same names keep recurring on that interminable list!), but one of these days there'll be nothing left with which to venture forth.

Why should I share you? Why don't you get rid of someone else for a change?

I am the least difficult of men. All I want is boundless love.

Even trees understand me! Good heavens, I lie under them, too, don't I? I'm just like a pile of leaves.

However, I have never clogged myself with the praises of pastoral life, nor with nostalgia for an innocent past of perverted acts in pastures. No. One need never leave the confines of New York to get all the greenery one wishes--I can't even enjoy a blade of grass unless i know there's a subway
handy, or a record store or some other sign that people do not totally _regret_ life. It is more important to affirm the least sincere; the clouds get enough attention as it is and even they continue to pass. Do they know what they're missing? Uh huh.

My eyes are vague blue, like the sky, and change all the time; they are indiscriminate but fleeting, entirely specific and disloyal, so that no one trusts me. I am always looking away. Or again at something after it has given me up. It makes me restless and that makes me unhappy, but I cannot keep them
still. If only i had grey, green, black, brown, yellow eyes; I would stay at home and do something. It's not that I'm curious. On the contrary, I am bored but it's my duty to be attentive, I am needed by things as the sky must be above the earth. And lately, so great has _their_ anxiety become, I can
spare myself little sleep.

Now there is only one man I like to kiss when he is unshaven. Heterosexuality! you are inexorably approaching. (How best discourage her?)

St. Serapion, I wrap myself in the robes of your whiteness which is like midnight in Dostoevsky. How I am to become a legend, my dear? I've tried love, but that holds you in the bosom of another and I'm always springing forth from it like the lotus--the ecstasy of always bursting forth! (but one must
not be distracted by it!) or like a hyacinth, "to keep the filth of life away," yes, even in the heart, where the filth is pumped in and slanders and pollutes and determines. I will my will, though I may become famous for a mysterious vacancy in that department, that greenhouse.

Destroy yourself, if you don't know!

It is easy to be beautiful; it is difficult to appear so. I admire you, beloved, for the trap you've set. It's like a final chapter no one reads because the plot is over.

"Fanny Brown is run away--scampered off with a Cornet of Horse; I do love that little Minx, & hope She may be happy, tho' She has vexed me by this exploit a little too.--Poor silly Cecchina! or F:B: as we used to call her.--I wish She had a good Whipping and 10,000 pounds."--Mrs. Thrale

I've got to get out of here. I choose a piece of shawl and my dirtiest suntans. I'll be back, I'll re-emerge, defeated, from the valley; you don't want me to go where you go, so I go where you don't want me to. It's only afternoon, there's a lot ahead. There won't be any mail downstairs. Turning, I spit in
the lock and the knob turns.

 

On Seeing Larry Rivers' "Washington Crossing the Delaware" at the Museum of Modern Art

Now that our hero has come back to us
in his white pants and we know his nose
trembling like a flag under fire,
we see the calm cold river is supporting
our forces, the beautiful history.

To be more revolutionary than a nun
is our desire, to be secular and intimate
as, when sighting a redcoat, you smile
and pull the trigger. Anxieties
and animosities, flaming and feeding

on theoretical considerations and
the jealous spiritualities of the abstract
the robot? they're smoke, billows above
the physical event. They have burned up.
See how free we are! as a nation of persons.

Dear father of our country, so alive
you must have lied incessantly to be
immediate, here are your bones crossed
on my breast like a rusty flintlock,
a pirate's flag, bravely specific

and ever so light in the misty glare
of a crossing by water in winter to a shore
other than that the bridge reaches for.
Don't shoot until, the white of freedom glinting
on your gun barrel, you see the general fear.

A True Account of Talking to the Sun on Fire Island


The Sun woke me this morning loud 
and clear, saying "Hey! I've been 
trying to wake you up for fifteen 
minutes. Don't be so rude, you are 
only the second poet I've ever chosen 
to speak to personally

so why
aren't you more attentive? If I could 
burn you through the window I would 
to wake you up. I can't hang around 
here all day."

"Sorry, Sun, I stayed
up late last night talking to Hal."

"When I woke up Mayakovsky he was 
a lot more prompt" the Sun said 
petulantly. "Most people are up 
already waiting to see if I'm going 
to put in an appearance."

I tried
to apologize "I missed you yesterday."
"That's better" he said. "I didn't 
know you'd come out." "You may be 
wondering why I've come so close?" 
"Yes" I said beginning to feel hot 
wondering if maybe he wasn't burning me 
anyway.

"Frankly I wanted to tell you 
I like your poetry. I see a lot 
on my rounds and you're okay. You may 
not be the greatest thing on earth, but 
you're different. Now, I've heard some 
say you're crazy, they being excessively 
calm themselves to my mind, and other 
crazy poets think that you're a boring 
reactionary. Not me.

Just keep on 
like I do and pay no attention. You'll 
find that people always will complain 
about the atmosphere, either too hot 
or too cold too bright or too dark, days
too short or too long.

If you don't appear
at all one day they think you're lazy
or dead. Just keep right on, I like it.

And don't worry about your lineage 
poetic or natural. The Sun shines on 
the jungle, you know, on the tundra 
the sea, the ghetto. Wherever you were 
I knew it and saw you moving. I was waiting 
for you to get to work.

And now that you 
are making your own days, so to speak, 
even if no one reads you but me 
you won't be depressed. Not 
everyone can look up, even at me. It 
hurts their eyes."
"Oh Sun, I'm so grateful to you!"

"Thanks and remember I'm watching. It's 
easier for me to speak to you out 
here. I don't have to slide down 
between buildings to get your ear. 
I know you love Manhattan, but 
you ought to look up more often.

And
always embrace things, people earth 
sky stars, as I do, freely and with 
the appropriate sense of space. That 
is your inclination, known in the heavens 
and you should follow it to hell, if 
necessary, which I doubt.

Maybe we'll 
speak again in Africa, of which I too 
am specially fond. Go back to sleep now 
Frank, and I may leave a tiny poem 
in that brain of yours as my farewell."

"Sun, don't go!" I was awake
at last. "No, go I must, they're calling
me."
"Who are they?"

Rising he said "Some
day you'll know. They're calling to you
too." Darkly he rose, and then I slept.

Ann Arbor Variations


Wet heat drifts through the afternoon
like a campus dog, a fraternity ghost
waiting to stay home from football games.
The arches are empty clear to the sky.

Except for the leaves: those lashes of our
thinking and dreaming and drinking sight.
The spherical radiance, the Old English
look, the sum of our being, "hath perced

to the roote" all our springs and falls
and now rolls over our limpness, a daily
dragon. We lose our health in a love
of color, drown in a fountain of myriads,

as simply as children. It is too hot,
our birth was given up to screaming. Our
life on these street lawns seems silent.
The leaves chatter their comparisons

to the wind and the sky fills up
before we are out of bed. O infinite
our siestas! adobe effigies in a land
that is sick of us and our tanned flesh.

The wind blows towards us particularly
the sobbing of our dear friends on both
coasts. We are sick of living and afraid
that death will not be by water, o sea.

2
Along the walks and shaded ways
pregnant women look snidely at children.
Two weeks ago they were told, in these

selfsame pools of trefoil, "the market
for emeralds is collapsing," "chlorophyll
shines in your eyes," "the sea's misery

is progenitor of the dark moss which hides
on the north side of trees and cries."
What do they think of slim kids now?

and how, when the summer's gong of day
and night slithers towards their sweat
and towards the nest of their arms

and thighs, do they feel about children
whose hides are pearly with days of swimming?
Do they mistake these fresh drops for tears?

The wind works over these women constantly!
trying, perhaps, to curdle their milk
or make their spring unseasonably fearful,

season they face with dread and bright eyes,
The leaves, wrinkled or shiny like apples,
wave women courage and sigh, a void temperature.

3
The alternatives of summer do not remove
us from this place. The fainting into skies
from a diving board, the express train to
Detroit's damp bars, the excess of affection
on the couch near an open window or a Bauhaus
fire escape, the lazy regions of stars, all
are strangers. Like Mayakovsky read on steps
of cool marble, or Yeats danced in a theatre
of polite music. The classroon day of dozing
and grammar, the partial eclipse of the head
in the row in front of the head of poplars,
sweet Syrinx! last out the summer in a stay
of iron. Workmen loiter before urinals, stare
out windows at girders tightly strapped to clouds.
And in the morning we whimper as we cook
an egg, so far from fluttering sands and azure!

4
The violent No! of the sun
burns the forehead of hills.
Sand fleas arrive from Salt Lake
and most of the theatres close.

The leaves roll into cigars, or
it seems our eyes stick together
in sleep. O forest, o brook of
spice, o cool gaze of strangers!

the city tumbles towards autumn
in a convulsion of tourists
and teachers. We dance in the dark,
forget the anger of what we blame

on the day. Children toss and murmur
as a rumba blankets their trees and
beckons their stars closer, older, now.
We move o'er the world, being so much here.

It's as if Poseidon left off counting
his waters for a moment! In the fields
the silence is music like the moon.
The bullfrogs sleep in their hairy caves.

across the avenue a trefoil lamp
of the streets tosses luckily.
The leaves, finally, love us! and
moonrise! we die upon the sun.

A City Winter

1
I understand the boredom of the clerks
fatigue shifting like dunes within their eyes
a frightful nausea gumming up the works
that once was thought aggression in disguise.
Do you remember? then how lightly dead
seemed the moon when over factories
it languid slid like a barrage of lead
above the heart, the fierce inventories
of desire. Now women wander our dreams
carrying money and to our sleep's shame
our hands twitch not for swift blood-sunk triremes
nor languorous white horses nor ill fame,
but clutch the groin that clouds a pallid sky
where tow'rs are sinking in their common eye.

2
My ship is flung upon the gutter's wrist
and cries for help of storm to violate
that flesh your curiosity too late
has flushed. The stem your garter tongue would twist
has sunk upon the waveless bosom's mist,
thigh of the city, apparition, hate,
and the tower whose doves have, delicate,
fled into my blood where they are not kissed.

You have left me to the sewer's meanwhile,
and I have answered the sea's open wish
to love me as a bonfire's watchful hand
guards red the shore and guards the hairy strand,
our most elegant lascivious bile,
my ship sinking beneath the gutter's fish.

3
How can I then, my dearest winter lay,
disgorge the tasty worm that eats me up
falling onto the stem of a highway
whose ardent rainbow is the spoon's flat cup
and in the vilest of blue suited force
enamored of the heated needle's arm
finds the ministrant an own tongue's remorse
so near the blood and still so far from harm,
thus to be eaten up and gobbled down
volcanoes of speedometers, the strike
that heats the iris into flame and flow'rs
the panting chalice so a turning pike:
you are not how the gods refused to die,
and I am scarred forever neath the eye.

4
What are my eyes? if they must feed me, rank
with forgetting, in the jealous forest
of lustrous blows, so luminously blank
through smoke and in the light. All faint, at rest,
yet I am racing towards the fear that kills
them off, friends and lovers, hast'ning through tears
like alcohol high in the throat of hills
and hills of night, alluring! their black cheers
falling upon my ears like nails. And there
the bars grow thick with onanists and camps
and bivouacs of bears with clubs, are fair
with their blows, deal death beneath purple lamps
and to me! I run! closer always move,
crying my name in fields of dead I love.

5
I plunge deep within this frozen lake
whose mirrored fastnesses fill up my heart,
where tears drift from frivolity to art
all white and slobbering, and by mistake
are the sky. I'm no whale to cruise apart
in fields impassive of my stench, my sake,
my sign to crushing seas that fall like fake
pillars to crash! to sow as wake my heart

and don't be niggardly. The snow drifts low
and yet neglects to cover me, and I
dance just ahead to keep my heart in sight.
How like a queen, to seek with jealous eye
the face that flees you, hidden city, white
swan. There's no art to free me, blinded so.



Fifteen

South of the bridge on Seventeenth
I found back of the willows one summer
day a motorcycle with engine running
as it lay on its side, ticking over
slowly in the high grass. I was fifteen.

I admired all that pulsing gleam, the
shiny flanks, the demure headlights
fringed where it lay; I led it gently
to the road and stood with that
companion, ready and friendly. I was fifteen.

We could find the end of a road, meet
the sky on out Seventeenth. I thought about
hills, and patting the handle got back a 
confident opinion. On the bridge we indulged
a forward feeling, a tremble. I was fifteen.

Thinking, back farther in the grass I found
the owner, just coming to, where he had flipped
over the rail. He had blood on his hand, was pale—
I helped him walk to his machine. He ran his hand
over it, called me good man, roared away.

I stood there, fifteen.

 

Traveling Through the Dark

Traveling through the dark I found a deer
dead on the edge of the Wilson River road.
It is usually best to roll them into the canyon:
that road is narrow; to swerve might make more dead.

By glow of the tail-light I stumbled back of the car
and stood by the heap, a doe, a recent killing;
she had stiffened already, almost cold.
I dragged her off; she was large in the belly.

My fingers touching her side brought me the reason—
her side was warm; her fawn lay there waiting,
alive, still, never to be born.
Beside that mountain road I hesitated.

The car aimed ahead its lowered parking lights;
under the hood purred the steady engine.
I stood in the glare of the warm exhaust turning red;
around our group I could hear the wilderness listen.

I thought hard for us all—my only swerving—,
then pushed her over the edge into the river.

 

One Home

Mine was a Midwest home—you can keep your world.
Plain black hats rode the thoughts that made our code.
We sang hymns in the house; the roof was near God.

The light bulb that hung in the pantry made a wan light,
but we could read by it the names of preserves—
outside, the buffalo grass, and the wind in the night.

A wildcat sprang at Grandpa on the Fourth of July
when he was cutting plum bushes for fuel,
before Indians pulled the West over the edge of the sky.

To anyone who looked at us we said, "My friend";
liking the cut of a thought, we could say "Hello."
(But plain black hats rode the thoughts that made our code.)

The sun was over our town; it was like a blade.
Kicking cottonwood leaves we ran toward storms.
Wherever we looked the land would hold us up.

 

A Family Turn

All her Kamikaze friends admired my aunt,
their leader, charmed in vinegar,
a woman who could blaze with such white blasts
as Lawrence's that lit Arabia.
Her mean opinions bent her hatpins.

We'd take a ride in her old car
that ripped like Sherman through society:
Main Street's oases sheltered no one
when she pulled up at Thirty-first
and whirled that Ford for another charge.

We swept headlines from under rugs, names
all over town, which I learned her way, by heart,
and blazed with love that burns because it's real.
With a turn that's our family's own,
she'd say, "Our town is not the same"—

Pause—"And it's never been."



Topography
After we flew across the country we got in bed, laid our bodies delicately together, like maps laid face to face, East to West, my San Francisco against your New York, your Fire Island against my Sonoma, my  New Orleans deep in your Texas, your Idaho bright on my Great Lakes, my Kansas  burning against your Kansas your Kansas burning against my Kansas, your Eastern Standard Time pressing into my  Pacific Time, my Mountain Time beating against your Central Time, your  sun rising swiftly from the right my  sun rising swiftly from the left your  moon rising slowly from the left my  moon rising slowly from the right until  all four bodies of the sky burn above us, sealing us together,  all our cities twin cities,  all our states united, one  nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

The Race   
When I got to the airport I rushed up to the desk,  bought a ticket, ten minutes later  they told me the flight was cancelled, the doctors  had said my father would not live through the night  and the flight was cancelled. A young man  with a dark brown moustache told me  another airline had a nonstop  leaving in seven minutes. See that  elevator over there, well go  down to the first floor, make a right, you'll  see a yellow bus, get off at the  second Pan Am terminal, I  ran, I who have no sense of direction  raced exactly where he'd told me, a fish  slipping upstream deftly against  the flow of the river. I jumped off that bus with those  bags I had thrown everything into  in five minutes, and ran, the bags  wagged me from side to side as if  to prove I was under the claims of the material,  I ran up to a man with a flower on his breast,  I who always go to the end of the line, I said  Help me. He looked at my ticket, he said  Make a left and then a right, go up the moving stairs and then  run. I lumbered up the moving stairs,  at the top I saw the corridor,  and then I took a deep breath, I said  goodbye to my body, goodbye to comfort,  I used my legs and heart as if I would  gladly use them up for this,  to touch him again in this life. I ran, and the  bags banged against me, wheeled and coursed  in skewed orbits, I have seen pictures of  women running, their belongings tied  in scarves grasped in their fists, I blessed my  long legs he gave me, my strong  heart I abandoned to its own purpose,  I ran to Gate 17 and they were  just lifting the thick white  lozenge of the door to fit it into  the socket of the plane. Like the one who is not  too rich, I turned sideways and  slipped through the needle's eye, and then  I walked down the aisle toward my father. The jet  was full, and people's hair was shining, they were  smiling, the interior of the plane was filled with a  mist of gold endorphin light,  I wept as people weep when they enter heaven,  in massive relief. We lifted up  gently from one tip of the continent  and did not stop until we set down lightly on the  other edge, I walked into his room  and watched his chest rise slowly  and sink again, all night  I watched him breathe. 

Sex Without Love 
How do they do it, the ones who make love without love? Beautiful as dancers, gliding over each other like ice-skaters over the ice, fingers hooked inside each other's bodies, faces red as steak, wine, wet as the children at birth whose mothers are going to give them away. How do they come to the come to the come to the God come to the still waters, and not love the one who came there with them, light rising slowly as steam off their joined skin? These are the true religious, the purists, the pros, the ones who will not accept a false Messiah, love the priest instead of the God. They do not mistake the lover for their own pleasure, they are like great runners: they know they are alone with the road surface, the cold, the wind, the fit of their shoes, their over-all cardio- vascular health--just factors, like the partner in the bed, and not the truth, which is the single body alone in the universe against its own best time.
 
I Go Back to May 1937 
I see them standing at the formal gates of their colleges,  I see my father strolling out under the ochre sandstone arch, the  red tiles glinting like bent  plates of blood behind his head, I  see my mother with a few light books at her hip  standing at the pillar made of tiny bricks with the  wrought-iron gate still open behind her, its  sword-tips black in the May air, they are about to graduate, they are about to get married,  they are kids, they are dumb, all they know is they are innocent, they would never hurt anybody. I want to go up to them and say Stop,  don't do it—she's the wrong woman,  he's the wrong man, you are going to do things  you cannot imagine you would ever do,  you are going to do bad things to children, you are going to suffer in ways you never heard of,  you are going to want to die. I want to go  up to them there in the late May sunlight and say it, her hungry pretty blank face turning to me, her pitiful beautiful untouched body,  his arrogant handsome blind face turning to me, his pitiful beautiful untouched body, but I don't do it. I want to live. I  take them up like the male and female  paper dolls and bang them together  at the hips like chips of flint as if to  strike sparks from them, I say Do what you are going to do, and I will tell about it. 
 
What is the Earth?
The earth is a homeless person. Or the earth's home is the atmosphere. Or the atmosphere is the earth's clothing, layers of it, the earth wears all of it, the earth is a homeless person. Or the atmosphere is the earth's cocoon, which it spun itself, the earth is a larvum. Or the atmosphere is the earth's skin— earth, and atmostphere, one homeless one. Or its orbit is the earth's home, or the path of the orbit just a path, the earth, a homeless person. Or the gutter of the earth's orbit is a circle of hell, the circle of the homeless. But the earth has a place, around the fire, the hearth of our star, the earth is at home, the earth is home to the homeless. For food, and warmth, and shelter, and health, they have earth and fire and air and water, for home they have the elements they are made of, as if each homeless one were an earth, made of milk and grain, like Ceres, and one could eat oneself—as if the human were a god, who could eat the earth, a god of homelessness. 
 
  
High School Senior
For seventeen years, her breath in the house  at night, puff, puff, like summer  cumulus above her bed,  and her scalp smelling of apricots —this being who had formed within me,  squatted like a bright tree-frog in the dark,  like an eohippus she had come out of history  slowly, through me, into the daylight,  I had the daily sight of her,  like food or air she was there, like a mother.  I say "college," but I feel as if I cannot tell the difference between her leaving for college  and our parting forever—I try to see this house without her, without her pure  depth of feeling, without her creek-brown hair, her daedal hands with their tapered  fingers, her pupils dark as the mourning cloak's wing, but I can't. Seventeen years ago, in this room, she moved inside me, I looked at the river, I could not imagine  my life with her. I gazed across the street,  and saw, in the icy winter sun, a column of steam rush up away from the earth.  There are creatures whose children float away  at birth, and those who throat-feed their young for weeks and never see them again. My daughter  is free and she is in me—no, my love  of her is in me, moving in my heart,  changing chambers, like something poured  from hand to hand, to be weighed and then reweighed.
 
Take the I Out 
But I love the I, steel I-beam  that my father sold. They poured the pig iron  into the mold, and it fed out slowly,  a bending jelly in the bath, and it hardened,  Bessemer, blister, crucible, alloy, and he  marketed it, and bought bourbon, and Cream  of Wheat, its curl of butter right  in the middle of its forehead, he paid for our dresses  with his metal sweat, sweet in the morning  and sour in the evening. I love the I,  frail between its flitches, its hard ground  and hard sky, it soars between them  like the soul that rushes, back and forth,  between the mother and father. What if they had loved each other,  how would it have felt to be the strut  joining the floor and roof of the truss?  I have seen, on his shirt-cardboard, years  in her desk, the night they made me, the penciled  slope of her temperature rising, and on  the peak of the hill, first soldier to reach  the crest, the Roman numeral I— I, I, I, I,  girders of identity, head on,  embedded in the poem. I love the I  for its premise of existence—our I—when I was  born, part gelid, I lay with you  on the cooling table, we were all there, a  forest of felled iron. The I is a pine,  resinous, flammable root to crown,  which throws its cones as far as it can in a fire.
 
1954
Then dirt scared me, because of the dirt he had put on her face. And her training bra scared me—the newspapers, morning and evening, kept saying it, training bra, as if the cups of it had been calling the breasts up—he buried her in it, perhaps he had never bothered to take it off. They found her underpants in a garbage can. And I feared the word eczema, like my acne and like the X in the paper which marked her body, as if he had killed her for not being flawless. I feared his name, Burton Abbott, the first name that was a last name, as if he were not someone specific. It was nothing one could learn from his face. His face was dull and ordinary, it took away what I’d thought I could count on about evil. He looked thin and lonely, it was horrifying, he looked almost humble. I felt awe that dirt was so impersonal, and pity for the training bra, pity and terror of eczema. And I could not sit on my mother’s electric blanket anymore, I began to have a  fear of electricity— the good people, the parents, were going to fry him to death. This was what his parents had been telling us: Burton Abbott, Burton Abbott, death to the person, death to the home planet. The worst thing was to think of her, of what it had been to be her, alive, to be walked, alive, into that cabin, to look into those eyes, and see the human
 
Crab
When I eat crab, slide the rosy rubbery claw across my tongue I think of my mother. She'd drive down to the edge of the Bay, tiny woman in a huge car, she'd ask the crab-man to crack it for her. She'd stand and wait as the pliers broke those chalky homes, wild- red and knobby, those cartilage wrists, the thin orange roof of the back. I'd come home, and find her at the table crisply unhousing the parts, laying the fierce shell on one side, the soft body on the other. She gave us lots, because we loved it so much, so there was always enough, a mound of crab like a cross between breast-milk and meat. The back even had the shape of a perfect ruined breast, upright flakes white as the flesh of a chrysanthemum, but the best part was the claw, she'd slide it out so slowly the tip was unbroken, scarlet bulb of the feeler—it was such a kick to easily eat that weapon, wreck its delicate hooked pulp between palate and tongue. She loved to feed us and all she gave us was fresh, she was willing to grasp shell, membrane, stem, to go close to dirt and salt to feed us, the way she had gone near our father himself to give us life. I look back and see us dripping at the table, feeding, her row of pink eaters, the platter of flawless limp claws, I look back further and see her in the kitchen, shelling flesh, her small hands curled—she is like a fish-hawk, wild, tearing the meat deftly, living out her life of fear and desire. 
 
May 1968 
When the Dean said we could not cross campus until the students gave up the buildings, we lay down, in the street, we said the cops will enter this gate over us. Lying back on the cobbles, I saw the buildings of New York City from dirt level, they soared up and stopped, chopped off--above them, the sky, the night air over the island. The mounted police moved, near us, while we sang, and then I began to count, 12, 13, 14, 15, I counted again, 15, 16, one month since the day on that deserted beach, 17, 18, my mouth fell open, my hair on the street, if my period did not come tonight I was pregnant. I could see the sole of a cop's shoe, the gelding's belly, its genitals-- if they took me to Women's Detention and did the exam on me, the speculum, the fingers--I gazed into the horse's tail like a comet-train. All week, I had thought about getting arrested, half-longed to give myself away. On the tar-- one brain in my head, another, in the making, near the base of my tail-- I looked at the steel arc of the horse's shoe, the curve of its belly, the cop's nightstick, the buildings streaming up away from the earth. I knew I should get up and leave, but I lay there looking at the space above us, until it turned deep blue and then ashy, colorless, Give me this one night, I thought, and I'll give this child the rest of my life, the horse's heads, this time, drooping, dipping, until they slept in a circle around my body and my daughter 
 
One Year 
When I got to his marker, I sat on it, like sitting on the edge of someone's bed  and I rubbed the smooth, speckled granite. I took some tears from my jaw and neck and started to wash a corner of his stone. Then a black and amber ant ran out onto the granite, and off it, and another ant hauled a dead ant onto the stone, leaving it, and not coming back. Ants ran down into the grooves of his name and dates, down into the oval track of the  first name's O, middle name's O, the short O of his last name, and down into the hyphen between his birth and death--little trough of his life. Soft bugs appeared on my shoes, like grains of pollen, I let them move on me, I rinsed a dark fleck of mica, and down inside the engraved letters the first dots of lichen were appearing like stars in early evening. I saw the speedwell on the ground with its horns, the coiled ferns, copper-beech blossoms, each petal like that disc of matter which swayed, on the last day, on his tongue. Tamarack, Western hemlock, manzanita, water birch with its scored bark, I put my arms around a trunk and squeezed it, then I lay down on my father's grave. The sun shone down on me, the powerful ants walked on me. When I woke, my cheek was crumbly, yellowish  with a mustard plaster of earth. Only at the last minute did I think of his body actually under me, the can of  bone, ash, soft as a goosedown pillow that bursts in bed with the lovers. When I kissed his stone it was not enough, when I licked it my tongue went dry a moment, I  ate his dust, I tasted my dirt host.
 
Primitive 
I have heard about the civilized,  the marriages run on talk, elegant and honest, rational. But you and I are  savages. You come in with a bag,  hold it out to me in silence.  I know Moo Shu Pork when I smell it  and understand the message: I have  pleased you greatly last night. We sit  quietly, side by side, to eat,  the long pancakes dangling and spilling,  fragrant sauce dripping out,  and glance at each other askance, wordless,  the corners of our eyes clear as spear points  laid along the sill to show  a friend sits with a friend here. 
 
The Victims 
When Mother divorced you, we were glad. She took it and took it in silence, all those years and then kicked you out, suddenly, and her kids loved it. Then you were fired, and we grinned inside, the way people grinned when Nixon's helicopter lifted off the South Lawn for the last time. We were tickled to think of your office taken away,  your secretaries taken away,  your lunches with three double bourbons,  your pencils, your reams of paper. Would they take your suits back, too, those dark carcasses hung in your closet, and the black noses of your shoes with their large pores?  She had taught us to take it, to hate you and take it until we pricked with her for your  annihilation, Father. Now I pass the bums in doorways, the white slugs of their bodies gleaming through slits in their suits of compressed silt, the stained flippers of their hands, the underwater fire of their eyes, ships gone down with the lanterns lit, and I wonder who took it and  took it from them in silence until they had given it all away and had nothing  left but this. 
 
The Pope's Penis 
It hangs deep in his robes, a delicate clapper at the center of a bell. It moves when he moves, a ghostly fish in a halo of silver sweaweed, the hair swaying in the dark and the heat -- and at night while his eyes sleep, it stands up in praise of God.
 
The Space Heater 
On the then-below-zero day, it was on, near the patients' chair, the old heater kept by the analyst's couch, at the end, like the infant's headstone that was added near the foot of my father's grave. And it was hot, with the almost laughing satire of a fire's heat, the little coils like hairs in Hell. And it was making a group of sick noises- I wanted the doctor to turn it off but I couldn't seem to ask, so I just stared, but it did not budge. The doctor turned his heavy, soft palm outward, toward me, inviting me to speak, I said, "If you're cold-are you cold? But if it's on  for me..." He held his palm out toward me, I tried to ask, but I only muttered, but he said, "Of course," as if I had asked, and he stood up and approached the heater, and then stood on one foot, and threw himself toward the wall with one hand, and with the other hand reached down, behind the couch, to pull the plug out. I looked away, I had not known he would have to bend like that. And I was so moved, that he would act undignified, to help me, that I cried, not trying to stop, but as if the moans made sentences which bore some human message. If he would cast himself toward the outlet for me, as if bending with me in my old shame and horror, then I would rest on his art-and the heater purred, like a creature or the familiar of a creature, or the child of a familiar, the father of a child, the spirit of a father, the healing of a spirit, the vision of healing, the heat of vision, the power of heat, the pleasure of power. 

  The Slash 
The first ones were attached to my dress at the waist, one on either side, right at the point where hands could clasp you and pick you up, as if you were a hot squeeze bottle of tree syrup, and the sashes that emerged like axil buds from the angles of the waist were used to play horses, that racing across the cement while someone held your reins and you could feel your flesh itself in your body wildly streaming. You would come home, a torn-off sash dangling from either hand, a snake-charmer— each time, she sewed them back on with thicker thread, until the seams of sash and dress bulged like little knots of gristle at your waist as you walked, you could feel them like thumbs pressing into your body. The next sash was the one Thee, Hannah! borrowed from her be-ribboned friend and hid in a drawer and got salve on it, salve on a sash, like bacon grease on a snake, God's lard on the ribbon a Quaker girl should not want, Satan's jism on silk delicate as the skin of a young girl's genital. When Hannah gave up satin her father told her she was beautiful just as God made her. But all sashes lead to the sash, very sash of very sash, begotten, not made, that my aunt sent from Switzerland— cobalt ripple of Swiss cotton with clean boys and girls dancing on it. I don't know why my mother chose it to tie me to the chair with, her eye just fell on it, but the whole day I felt those blue children dance around my wrists. Later someone told me they had found out the universe is a kind of strip that twists around and joins itself, and I believe it, sometimes I can feel it, the way we are pouring slowly toward a curve and around it through something dark and soft, and we are bound to each other.    


The Mortal One 
Three months after he lies dead, that long yellow narrow body, not like Christ but like one of his saints, the naked ones in the paintings whose bodies are done in gilt, all knees and raw ribs, the ones who died of nettles, bile, the one who died roasted over a slow fire— three months later I take the pot of tulip bulbs out of the closet and set it on the table and take off the foil hood. The shoots stand up like young green pencils, and there in the room is the comfortable smell of rot, the bulb that did not make it, marked with ridges like an elephant's notched foot, I walk down the hall as if I were moving through the long stem of the tulip toward the closed sheath. In the kitchen I throw a palmful of peppercorns into the saucepan as if I would grow a black tree from the soup, I throw out the rotten chicken part, glad again that we burned my father before one single bloom of mold could grow up out of him, maybe it had begun in his bowels but we burned his bowels the way you burn the long blue scarf of the dead, and all their clothing, cleansing with fire. How fast time goes now that I'm happy, now that I know how to think of his dead body every day without shock, almost without grief, to take it into each part of the day the way a loom parts the vertical threads, half to the left half to the right like the Red Sea and you throw the shuttle through with the warp-thread attached to the feet, that small gold figure of my father— how often I saw him in paintings and did not know him, the tiny naked dead one in the corner, the mortal one. 
 
The Daughter Goes to Camp 
In the taxi alone, home from the airport, I could not believe you were gone. My palm kept creeping over the smooth plastic to find your strong meaty little hand and squeeze it, find your narrow thigh in the noble ribbing of the corduroy, straight and regular as anything in nature, to find the slack cool cheek of a child in the heat of a summer morning— nothing, nothing, waves of bawling hitting me in hot flashes like some change of life, some boiling wave rising in me toward your body, toward where it should have been on the seat, your brow curved like a cereal bowl, your eyes dark with massed crystals like the magnified scales of a butterfly's wing, the delicate feelers of your limp hair, floods of blood rising in my face as I tried to reassemble the hot gritty molecules in the car, to make you appear like a holograph on the back seat, pull you out of nothing as I once did—but you were really gone, the cab glossy as a slit caul out of which you had slipped, the air glittering electric with escape as it does in the room at a birth. 
  The Arrivals
I pull the bed slowly open, I open the lips of the bed, get the stack of fresh underpants out of the suitcase—peach, white, cherry, quince, pussy willow, I choose a color and put them on, I travel with the stack for the stack's caress, dry and soft. I enter the soft birth-lips of the bed, take off my glasses, and the cabbage-roses on the curtain blur to Keats's peonies, the ochre willow holds a cloud the way a skeleton holds flesh and it passes, does not hold it. The bed fits me like a walnut shell its meat, my hands touch the upper corners, the lower, my feet. It is so silent I hear the choirs of wild silence, the maenads of the atoms. Is this what it feels like to have a mother? The sheets are heavy cream, whipped. Ah, here is my mother, or rather here she is not, so this is paradise. But surely that was paradise, when her Jell-O nipple was the size of my own fist, in front of my face—out of its humped runkles those several springs of milk, so fierce almost fearsome. What did I think in that brain gridded for thought, its cups loaded with languageless rennet? And at night, when they timed me, four hours of screaming, not a minute more, four, those quatrains of icy yell, then the cold tap water to get me over my shameless hunger, what was it like to be there when that hunger was driven into my structure at such heat it alloyed that iron? Where have I been while this person is leading my life with her patience, will and order? In the garden; on the bee and under the bee; in the crown gathering cumulus and flensing it from the boughs, weeping a rehearsal for the rotting and casting off of our flesh, the year we slowly throw it off like clothing by the bed covers of our lover, and dive under. 
 
The Borders
To say that she came into me, from another world, is not true. Nothing comes into the universe and nothing leaves it. My mother—I mean my daughter did not enter me. She began to exist inside me—she appeared within me. And my mother did not enter me. When she lay down, to pray, on me, she was always ferociously courteous, fastidious with Puritan fastidiousness, but the barrier of my skin failed, the barrier of my body fell, the barrier of my spirit. She aroused and magnetized my skin, I wanted ardently to please her, I would say to her what she wanted to hear, as if I were hers. I served her willingly, and then became very much like her, fiercely out for myself. When my daughter was in me, I felt I had a soul in me. But it was born with her. But when she cried, one night, such pure crying, I said I will take care of you, I will put you first. I will not ever have a daughter the way she had me, I will not ever swim in you the way my mother swam in me and I felt myself swum in. I will never know anyone again the way I knew my mother, the gates of the human fallen.
 The Clasp 
She was four, he was one, it was raining, we had colds, we had been in the apartment two weeks straight, I grabbed her to keep her from shoving him over on his face, again, and when I had her wrist in my grasp I compressed it, fiercely, for a couple of seconds, to make an impression on her, to hurt her, our beloved firstborn, I even almost savored the stinging sensation of the squeezing, the expression, into her, of my anger, "Never, never, again," the righteous chant accompanying the clasp. It happened very fast-grab, crush, crush, crush, release-and at the first extra force, she swung her head, as if checking who this was, and looked at me, and saw me-yes, this was her mom, her mom was doing this. Her dark, deeply open eyes took me in, she knew me, in the shock of the moment she learned me. This was her mother, one of the two whom she most loved, the two who loved her most, near the source of love  was this.
 
The End 
 
The Pact
We played dolls in that house where Father staggered with the Thanksgiving knife, where Mother wept at noon into her one ounce of cottage cheese, praying for the strength not to kill herself. We kneeled over the rubber bodies, gave them baths carefully, scrubbed their little orange hands, wrapped them up tight, said goodnight, never spoke of the woman like a gaping wound weeping on the stairs, the man like a stuck buffalo, baffled, stunned, dragging arrows in his side. As if we had made a pact of silence and safety, we kneeled and dressed those tiny torsos with their elegant belly-buttons and minuscule holes high on the buttock to pee through and all that darkness in their open mouths, so that I have not been able to forgive you for giving your daughter away, letting her go at eight as if you took Molly Ann or Tiny Tears and held her head under the water in the bathinette until no bubbles rose, or threw her dark rosy body on the fire that burned in that house where you and I barely survived, sister, where we swore to be protectors.
 

A Week Later

A week later, I said to a friend: I don't think I could ever write about it. Maybe in a year I could write something. There is something in me maybe someday to be written; now it is folded, and folded, and folded, like a note in school. And in my dream someone was playing jacks, and in the air there was a huge, thrown, tilted jack on fire. And when I woke up, I found myself counting the days since I had last seen my husband--only two years, and some weeks, and hours. We had signed the papers and come down to the ground floor of the Chrysler Building, the intact beauty of its lobby around us like a king's tomb, on the ceiling the little painted plane, in the mural, flying. And it entered my strictured heart, this morning, slightly, shyly as if warily, untamed, a greater sense of the sweetness and plenty of his ongoing life, unknown to me, unseen by me, unheard, untouched-but known, seen, heard, touched. And it came to me, for moments at a time, moment after moment, to be glad for him that he is with the one he feels was meant for him. And I thought of my mother, minutes from her death, eighty-five years from her birth, the almost warbler bones of her shoulder under my hand, the eggshell skull, as she lay in some peace in the clean sheets, and I could tell her the best of my poor, partial love, I could sing her out with it, I saw the luck and luxury of that hour.
  Japanese-American Farmhouse, California, 1942
Everything has been taken that anyone thought worth taking. The stairs are tilted, scattered with sycamore leaves curled like ammonites in inland rock. Wood shows through the paint on the frame and the door is open--an empty room, sunlight on the floor. All that is left on the porch is the hollow cylinder of an Albert's Quick Oats cardboard box and a sewing machine. Its extraterrestrial head is bowed, its scrolled neck glistens. I was born, that day, near there, in wartime, of ignorant people. 
 

Your's, Kindly 

Because I felt too weak to move you kindly moved for me, kneeling and turning, until you could take my breast-tip in the socket of your lips; and my womb went down  on itself, drew sharply over and over to its tightest shape, the way, when newborns nurse, the fist of the uterus with each, milk, tug, powerfully shuts. I saw your hand, near me, your daily hand, your thumbnail, the quiet ordinary self, when your mouth at my breast was drawing sweet gashes of come up from my womb made black fork-flashes of a  celibate's lust shoot through me. And I couldn't lift my head, and you swiveled, and came down close to me, delicate blunt touch of your hard penis in long  caresses down my face, species happiness, calm which gleams with fearless anguished desire. It found my pouring mouth, the back of my throat, and the bright wall which opens. It seemed to take us hours to move the bone creatures so their gods could be fitted to each other, and then, at last, home, root in the earth, wing in the air. As it finished, it seemed my sex was a grey flower the color of the brain, smooth and glistening, a complex calla or iris which you  were creating with the errless digit of your sex. But then, as it finished again, one could not speak of a blossom, or the blossom  was stripped away, as if, until that moment, the cunt had been clothed, still, in the thinnest garment, and now was bare or more than bare, silver wet-suit of  matter itself gone, nothing there but the paradise flay. And then more, that cannot be told — may be, but cannot be, things that did not have to do with me, as if some  wires crossed, and history or war, or the witches possessed, or the end of life were happening in me, or as if  I were in a borrowed body, I knew what I could not know, did — was done to — what I cannot-do-be-done-to, so when  we returned, I cried, afraid for a moment I was dead, and had got my wish to come back, once, and sleep with you, on a summer afternoon, in an empty house where no one could hear us. I lowered the salt breasts of my eyes to your lips, and you sucked, then I looked at your face, at its absence of unkindness, its giving that absence off as a matter I cannot name, as if I was seeing not you but something between us, that can live only between us. I stroked back the hair in pond and sex rivulets from your forehead, gently raked it back along your scalp, I did not think of my father's hair in death, those oiled paths, I lay along your length and did not think how he did not love me, how he trained me not to be loved.



Dishwater

 Slap of the screen door, flat knock
of my grandmother’s boxy black shoes
on the wooden stoop, the hush and sweep
of her knob-kneed, cotton-aproned stride
out to the edge and then, toed in
with a furious twist and heave,
a bridge that leaps from her hot red hands
and hangs there shining for fifty years
over the mystified chickens,
over the swaying nettles, the ragweed,
the clay slope down to the creek,
over the redwing blackbirds in the tops
of the willows, a glorious rainbow
with an empty dishpan swinging at one end.

                             
PORCH SWING IN SEPTEMBER
 The porch swing hangs fixed in a morning sun
that bleaches its gray slats, its flowered cushion
whose flowers have faded, like those of summer,
and a small brown spider has hung out her webs
on a line between porch post and chain
so that no one may swing without breaking it.
She is saying it’s time that the swinging were done with,
time that the creaking and pinging and popping
that sang through the ceiling were past,
time now for the soft vibrations of moths,
the wasp tapping each board for an entrance,
the cool dewdrops to brush from her work
every morning, one world at a time.      


A Room in the Past 

It’s a kitchen. Its curtains fill 
with a morning light so bright 
you can’t see beyond its windows 
into the afternoon. A kitchen 
falling through time with its things 
in their places, the dishes jingling 
up in the cupboard, the bucket 



Cuba, 1962 
When the rooster jumps up on the windowsill  and spreads his red-gold wings,  I wake, thinking it is the sun  and call Juanita, hearing her answer,  but only in my mind.  I know she is already outside,  breaking the cane off at ground level,  using only her big hands.  I get the machete and walk among the cane,  until I see her, lying face-down in the dirt. 
Juanita, dead in the morning like this.  I raise the machete— what I take from the earth, I give back— and cut off her feet.  I lift the body and carry it to the wagon,  where I load the cane to sell in the village.  Whoever tastes my woman in his candy, his cake,  tastes something sweeter than this sugar cane;  it is grief.  If you eat too much of it, you want more,  you can never get enough.    
 The Anniversary 
You raise the ax,  the block of wood screams in half,  while I lift the sack of flour  and carry it into the house.  I'm not afraid of the blade  you've just pointed at my head.  If I were dead, you could take the boy,  hunt, kiss gnats, instead of my moist lips.  Take it easy, squabs are roasting,  corn, still in husks, crackles,  as the boy dances around the table:  old guest at a wedding party for two sad-faced clowns,  who together, never won a round of anything but hard times.  Come in, sheets are clean,  fall down on me for one more year  and we can blast another hole in ourselves without a sound. 

The Country Midwife:  A Day 


The fine delight that fathers thought; the strong 
Spur, live and lancing like the blowpipe flame, 
Breathes once and, quenchèd faster than it came, 
Leaves yet the mind a mother of immortal song. 
Nine months she then, nay years, nine years she long 
Within her wears, bears, cares and combs the same: 
The widow of an insight lost she lives, with aim 
Now known and hand at work now never wrong. 
  Sweet fire the sire of muse, my soul needs this; 
I want the one rapture of an inspiration. 
O then if in my lagging lines you miss 
the roll, the rise, the carol, the creation, 
My winter world, that scarcely breathes that bliss 
Now, yields you, with some sighs, our explanation. 


No worst, there is none. Pitched past pitch of grief, 
More pangs will, schooled at forepangs, wilder wring. 
Comforter, where, where is your comforting? 
Mary, mother of us, where is your relief? 
My cries heave, herds-long; huddle in a main, a chief 
Woe, world-sorrow; on an age-old anvil wince and sing -- 
Then lull, then leave off. Fury had shrieked "No ling- 
ering! Let me be fell: force I must be brief". 
   O the mind, mind has mountains; cliffs of fall 
Frightful, sheer, no-man-fathomed. Hold them cheap 
May who ne'er hung there. Nor does long our small 
Durance deal with that steep or deep. Here! creep, 
Wretch, under a comfort serves in a whirlwind: all 
Life death does end and each day dies with sleep. 


It was a hard thing to undo this knot. 
The rainbow shines but only in the thought 
Of him that looks. Yet not in that alone, 
For who makes rainbows by invention? 
And many standing round a waterfall 
See one bow each, yet not the same to all, 
But each a hand's breadth further than the next. 
The sun on falling waters writes the text 
Which yet is in the eye or in the thought. 
It was a hard thing to undo this knot. 




 Let us have madness openly.
O men Of my generation.
Let us follow
The footsteps of this slaughtered age:
See it trail across Time's dim land
Into the closed house of eternity
With the noise that dying has,
With the face that dead things wear--
nor ever say
We wanted more; we looked to find
An open door, an utter deed of love,
Transforming day's evil darkness;
but We found extended hell and fog Upon the earth,
and within the head
A rotting bog of lean huge graves. 




As We Are So Wonderfully Done With Each Other - Poem by Kenneth Patchen
Autoplay next video

As we are so wonderfully done with each other
We can walk into our separate sleep
On floors of music where the milkwhite cloak of childhood lies

O my lady, my fairest dear, my sweetest, loveliest one
Your lips have splashed my dull house with the speech of flowers
My hands are hallowed where they touched over your
soft curving.

It is good to be weary from that brilliant work
It is being God to feel your breathing under me

A waterglass on the bureau fills with morning . . .
Don’t let anyone in to wake us. 



Be music, night,
That her sleep may go
Where angels have their pale tall choirs

Be a hand, sea,
That her dreams may watch
Thy guidesman touching the green flesh of the world

Be a voice, sky,
That her beauties may be counted
And the stars will tilt their quiet faces
Into the mirror of her loveliness

Be a road, earth,
That her walking may take thee
Where the towns of heaven lift their breathing spires

O be a world and a throne, God,
That her living may find its weather
And the souls of ancient bells in a child's book
Shall lead her into Thy wondrous house 



Wherever the dead are there they are and
Nothing more. But you and I can expect
To see angels in the meadowgrass that look
Like cows -
And wherever we are in paradise
in furnished room without bath and
six flights up
Is all God! We read
To one another, loving the sound of the s’s
Slipping up on the f’s and much is good
Enough to raise the hair on our heads, like Rilke and Wilfred Owen

Any person who loves another person,
Wherever in the world, is with us in this room -
Even though there are battlefields. 



The old guy put down his beer.
Son, he said,
(and a girl came over to the table where we were:
asked us by Jack Christ to buy her a drink.)
Son, I am going to tell you something
The like of which nobody was ever told.
(and the girl said, I've got nothing on tonight;
how about you and me going to your place?)
I am going to tell you the story of my mother's
Meeting with God.
(and I whispered to the girl: I don't have a room,
but maybe...)
She walked up to where the top of the world is
And He came right up to her and said
So at last you've come home.
(but maybe what?
I thought I'd like to stay here and talk to you.)
My mother started to cry and God
Put His arms around her.
(about what?
Oh, just talk...we'll find something.)
She said it was like a fog coming over her face
And light was everywhere and a soft voice saying
You can stop crying now.
(what can we talk about that will take all night?
and I said that I didn't know.)


You can stop crying now. 



Man-dirt and stomachs that the sea unloads; rockets
of quick lice crawling inland, planting their damn flags,
putting their malethings in any hole that will stand still,
yapping bloody murder while they slice off each other’s heads,
spewing themselves around, priesting, whoring, lording
it over little guys, messing their pants, writing gush-notes
to their grandmas, wanting somebody to do something pronto,
wanting the good thing right now and the bad stuff for the other boy.
Gullet, praise God for the gut with the patented zipper;
sing loud for the lads who sell ice boxes on the burning deck.
Dear reader, gentle reader, dainty little reader, this is
the way we go round the milktrucks and seamusic, Sike’s trap and Meg’s rib,
the wobbly sparrow with two strikes on the bible, behave
Alfred, your pokus is out; I used to collect old ladies,
pickling them in brine and painting mustaches on their bellies,
later I went in for stripteasing before Save Democracy Clubs;
when the joint was raided we were all caught with our pants down.
But I will say this: I like butter on both sides of my bread
and my sister can rape a Hun any time she’s a mind to,
or the Yellow Peril for that matter; Hector, your papa’s in the lobby.
The old days were different; the ball scores meant something then,
two pill in the side pocket and two bits says so; he got up slow see,
shook the water out of his hair, wam, tell me that ain’t a sweet left hand;
I told her what to do and we did it, Jesus I said, is your name McCoy?
Maybe it was the beer or because she was only sixteen but I got hoarse
just thinking about her; married a john who travels in cotton underwear.
Now you take today; I don’t want it. Wessex, who was that with I saw you lady?
Tony gave all his dough to the church; Lizzie believed in feeding her own face;
and that’s why you’ll never meet a worm who isn’t an antichrist, my friend,
I mean when you get down to a brass tack you’ll find some sucker sitting on it.
Whereas. Muckle’s whip and Jessie’s rod, boyo, it sure looks black
in the gut of this particular whale. Hilda, is that a .38 in your handbag?


Ghosts in packs like dogs grinning at ghosts
Pocketless thieves in a city that never sleeps
Chains clank, warders curse, this world is stark mad


Hey! Fatty, don’t look now but that’s a Revolution breathing down your neck. 




Speak softly; sun going down
Out of sight. Come near me now.

Dear dying fall of wings as birds
complain against the gathering dark...

Exaggerate the green blood in grass;
the music of leaves scraping space;

Multiply the stillness by one sound;
by one syllable of your name...

And all that is little is soon giant,
all that is rare grows in common beauty

To rest with my mouth on your mouth
as somewhere a star falls

And the earth takes it softly, in natural love...
Exactly as we take each other...
and go to sleep... 



In the footsteps of the walking air
Sky's prophetic chickens weave their cloth of awe
And hillsides lift green wings in somber journeying.

Night in his soft haste bumps on the shoulders of the abyss
And a single drop of dark blood covers the earth.

Now is the China of the spirit at walking
In my reaches.
A sable organ sounds in my gathered will
And love's inscrutable skeleton sings.

My seeing moves under a vegetable shroud
And dead forests stand where once Mary stood.

Sullen stone dogs wait in the groves of water ...
Though the wanderer drown, his welfare is as a fire
That burns at the bottom of the sea, warming
Unknown roads for sleep to walk upon. 




I believe that a young woman
Is standing in a circle of lions
In the other side of the sky.

In a little while I must carry her the flowers
Which only fade here; and she will not cry
If my hands are not very full.

±

Fiery antlers toss within the forests of heaven
And ocean’s plaintive towns
Echo the tread of celestial feet.
O the beautiful eyes stare down…
What have we done that we are blessèd?
What have we died that we hasten to God?

±

And all the animals are asleep again
In their separate caves.
Hairy bellies distended with their kill.
Culture blubbering in and out
Like the breath of a stranded fish.
Crucifixion in wax. The test-tube messiahs.
Immaculate fornication under the smoking walls
Of a dead world.
I dig for my death
in this thousand-watt dungheap.
There isn’t even enough clean air.
To die in.
O blood-bearded destroyer!

In other times...
(soundless barges float
down the rivers of death)
In another heart
These crimes may not flower…
What have we done that we are blessèd?
What have we damned that we are blinded?

±

Now, with my seven-holed head open
On the air whence comes a fabulous mariner
To take his place among the spheres—
The air which is God
And the mariner who is sheep—I fold
Upon myself like a bird over flames. Then
All my nightbound juices sing. Snails
Pop out of unexpected places and the long
light lances of waterbulls plunge
into the green crotch of my native land.
Eyes peer out of the seaweed that gently sways
Above the towers and salt gates of a lost world.

±

On the other side of the sky
A young woman is standing
In a circle of lions—
The young woman who is dream
And the lions which are death. 




Let us have madness openly.
O men Of my generation.
Let us follow
The footsteps of this slaughtered age:
See it trail across Time's dim land
Into the closed house of eternity
With the noise that dying has,
With the face that dead things wear--
nor ever say
We wanted more; we looked to find
An open door, an utter deed of love,
Transforming day's evil darkness;
but We found extended hell and fog Upon the earth,
and within the head
A rotting bog of lean huge graves. 




We must be slow and delicate; return
the policeman's stare with some esteem,
remember this is not a shadow play
of doves and geese but this is now
the time to write it down, record the words—
I mean we should have left some pride
of youth and not forget the destiny of men
who say goodbye to the wives and homes
they've read about at breakfast in a restaurant:
'My love.'—without regret or bitterness
obtain the measure of the stride we make,
the latest song has chosen a theme of love
delivering us from all evil—destroy. . . ?
why no. . . this too is fanciful. . . funny how
hard it is to be slow and delicate in this,
this thing of framing words to mark this grave
I mean nothing short of blood in every street
on earth can fitly voice the loss of these. 



The Dove walks with sticky feet
Upon the green crowns of the almond tree,
Its feathers smeared over with warmth
Like honey
That dips lazily down into the shadow ...

Anyone standing in that orchard.So filled with peace and sleep,
Would hardly have noticed the hill
Nearby
With its three strange wooden arms
Lifted above a throng of motionless people
- Above the helmets of Pilate's soldiers
Flashing like silver teeth in the sun. 




Tiny green birds skate over the surface of the room.
A naked girl prepares a basin with steaming water,
And in the corner away from the hearth, the red wheels
Of an up-ended chariot slowly turn.
After a long moment, the door to the other world opens
And the golden figure of a man appears. He stands
Ruddy as a salmon beside the niche where are kept
The keepsakes of the Prince of Earth; then sadly, drawing
A hammer out of his side, he advances to an oaken desk,
And being careful to strike in exact fury, pounds it to bits.
Another woman has by now taken her station
Beside the bubbling tub.
Her legs are covered with a silken blue fur,
Which in places above the knees
Grows to the thickness of a lion's mane.
The upper sphere of her chest
Is gathered into huge creases by two jeweled pins.
Transparent little boots reveal toes
Which an angel could want.
Beneath her on the floor a beautiful cinnamon cat
Plays with a bunch of yellow grapes, running
Its paws in and out like a boy being a silly king.
Her voice is round and white as she says:
'Your bath is ready, darling. Don't wait too long.'
But he has already drawn away to the window
And through its circular opening looks,
As a man into the pages of his death.
'Terrible horsemen are setting fire to the earth.
Houses are burning ... the people fly before
The red spears of a speckled madness . . .'
'Please, dear,' interrupts the original woman,
'We cannot help them ... Under the cancerous foot
Of their hatred, they were born to perish -
Like beasts in a well of spiders ...
Come now, sweet; the water will get cold.'
A little wagon pulled by foxes lowers from the ceiling.
Three men are seated on its cushions which breathe
Like purple breasts. The head of one is tipped
To the right, where on a bed of snails, a radiant child
Is crowing sleepily; the heads of the other two are turned
Upward, as though in contemplation
Of an authority which is not easily apprehended.
Yet they act as one, lifting the baby from its rosy perch,
And depositing it gently in the tub.
The water hisses over its scream ... a faint smell
Of horror floats up. Then the three withdraw
With their hapless burden, and the tinny bark
Of the foxes dies on the air.
'It hasn't grown cold yet,' the golden figure says,
And he strokes the belly of the second woman,
Running his hands over her fur like someone asleep.
They lie together under the shadow of a giant crab
Which polishes its thousand vises beside the fire.
Farther back, nearly obscured by kettles and chairs,
A second landscape can be seen; then a third, fourth,
Fifth ... until the whole, fluted like a rose,
And webbed in a miraculous workmanship,
Ascends unto the seven thrones
Where Tomorrow sits.
Slowly advancing down these shifting levels,
The white Queen of Heaven approaches.
Stars glitter in her hair. A tree grows
Out of her side, and gazing through the foliage
The eyes of the Beautiful gleam - 'Hurry, darling,'
The first woman calls. 'The water is getting cold.'
But he does not hear.
The hilt of the knife is carved like a scepter
And like a scepter gently sways
Above his mutilated throat ...
Smiling like a fashionable hat, the furry girl
Walks quickly to the tub, and throwing off
Her stained gown, eels into the water.
The other watches her sorrowfully; then,
Without haste, as one would strangle an owl,
She flicks the wheel of the chariot - around
Which the black world bends ...
    without thrones or gates, without faith,
    warmth or light for any of its creatures;
    where even the children go mad - and
As though unwound on a scroll, the picture
Of Everyman's murder winks back at God.
Farther away now, nearly hidden by the human,
Another landscape can be seen ...
And the wan, smiling Queen of Heaven appears
For a moment on the balconies of my chosen sleep. 




So it is the duty of the artist to discourage all traces of shame
To extend all boundaries
To fog them in right over the plate
To kill only what is ridiculous
To establish problem
To ignore solutions
To listen to no one
To omit nothing
To contradict everything
To generate the free brain
To bear no cross
To take part in no crucifixion
To tinkle a warning when mankind strays
To explode upon all parties
To wound deeper than the soldier
To heal this poor obstinate monkey once and for all

To verify the irrational
To exaggerate all things
To inhibit everyone
To lubricate each proportion
To experience only experience

To set a flame in the high air
To exclaim at the commonplace alone
To cause the unseen eyes to open

To admire only the abrsurd
To be concerned with every profession save his own
To raise a fortuitous stink on the boulevards of truth and beauty
To desire an electrifiable intercourse with a female alligator
To lift the flesh above the suffering
To forgive the beautiful its disconsolate deceit

To flash his vengeful badge at every abyss

To HAPPEN

It is the artist’s duty to be alive
To drag people into glittering occupations

To blush perpetually in gaping innocence
To drift happily through the ruined race-intelligence
To burrow beneath the subconscious
To defend the unreal at the cost of his reason
To obey each outrageous inpulse
To commit his company to all enchantments. 




These of living emanate a formidable light,
Which is equal to death, and when used
Gives increase eternally.
What fortifies in separate thought
Is not drawn by wind or by man defiled.
So whispers the parable of doubleness.
As it is necessary not to submit
To power which weakens the hidden forms;
It is extraordinarily more essential
Not to deny welcome to these originating forces
When they gather within our heat
To give us habitation.
The one life must be attempted with the other,
That we may embark upon the fiery work
For which we were certainly made.


What has been separated from the mother,
Must again be joined; for we were born of spirit,
And to spirit all mortal things return,
As it is necessary in the method of earth.
So sings the parable of singleness.
My comforter does not conceal his face;
I have seen appearances that were not marshalled
By sleep.
Perhaps I am to be stationed
At the nets which move through this completing sea.
Or I have hunting on my sign.


Yet the ground is visible,
The center of our seeing. (The houses rest
Like sentinels on this hawking star.
Two women are bathing near a trestle;
Their bodies dress the world in golden birds;
The skin of their throats is a dancing flute. . .
How alter or change? How properly
Find an exact equation? What is flying
Anywhere that is more essential to our quest?
Even the lake. . . boat walking on its blue streets;
Organ of thunder muttering in the sky. . . A tiger
Standing on the edge of a plowed field. . .
What is necessary? What is inseparable to know?
The children seek silvery-pretty caves. . .
What are we to teach?)
The distance is not great
To worlds of magnificent joy or nowhere.

The Deer And The Snake - Poem by Kenneth Patchen
Autoplay next video

The deer is humble, lovely as God made her
I watch her eyes and think of wonder owned

These strange priests enter the cathedral of woods
And seven Marys clean their hands to woo her

Foot lifted, dagger-sharp—her ears
Poised to their points like a leaf's head

But the snake strikes, in a velvet arc
Of murderous speed—assassin beautiful

As mountain water at which a fawn drank
Stand there, forever, while poison works
While I stand counting the arms of your Cross
Thinking that many Christs could hang there, crying. 


And all that is this day. . .
The boy with cap slung over what had been a face. ..

Somehow the cop will sleep tonight, will make love to his
wife...
Anger won't help. I was born angry. Angry that my father was
being burnt alive in the mills; Angry that none of us knew
anything but filth, and poverty. Angry because I was that very
one somebody was supposed To be fighting for
Turn him over; take a good look at his face...
Somebody is going to see that face for a long time.
I wash his hands that in the brightness they will shine.
We have a parent called the earth.
To be these buds and trees; this tameless bird Within the
ground; this season's act upon the fields of Man.
To be equal to the littlest thing alive,
While all the swarming stars move silent through The merest
flower
. .. but the fog of guns.
The face with all the draining future left blank. . . Those smug
saints, whether of church or Stalin, Can get off the back of
my people, and stay off. Somebody is supposed to be fighting
for somebody. . . And Lenin is terribly silent, terribly silent
and dead. 



A beast stands at my eye.

I cook my senses in a dark fire.
The old wombs rot and the new mother
Approaches with the footsteps of a world.

Who are the people of this unscaled heaven?
What beckons?
Whose blood hallows this grim land?
What slithers along the watershed of my human sleep?

The other side of knowing ...
Caress of unwaking delight ... O start
A sufficient love! O gently silent forms
Of the last spaces. 



The Orange bears with soft friendly eyes
Who played with me when I was ten,
Christ, before I'd left home they'd had
Their paws smashed in the rolls, their backs
Seared by hot slag, their soft trusting
Bellies kicked in, their tongues ripped
Out, and I went down through the woods
To the smelly crick with Whitman
In the Haldeman-Julius edition,
And I just sat there worrying my thumbnail
Into the cover---What did he know about
Orange bears with their coats all stunk up with soft coal
And the National Guard coming over
From Wheeling to stand in front of the millgates
With drawn bayonets jeering at the strikers?

I remember you would put daisies
On the windowsill at night and in
The morning they'd be so covered with soot
You couldn't tell what they were anymore.

A hell of a fat chance my orange bears had! 



The sleds of the children
Move down the right slope.
To the left, hazed in the tumbling air,
A thousand lights smudge
Within the branches of the old forest,
Like colored moons in a well of milk.


The sleds of the children
Make no sound on the hard-packed snow.
Their bright cries are not heard
On that strange hill.
The youngest are wrapped
In cloth of gold, and their scarfs
Have been dipped in blood.
All the others, from the son
Of Tegos, who is the Bishop
Of Black Church—near Tarn,
On to the daughter of the least slut,
Are garbed in love's shining dress;
Naked little eels, they flash
Across the amazed ice.
And behind each sled
There trots a man with his sex
Held like a whip in his snaking hand.


But no one sees the giant horse
That climbs the steps which stretch forth
Between the calling lights and that hill
Straight up to the throne of God.
He is taller than the highest tree
And his flanks steam under the cold moon.
The beat of his heart shakes the sky
And his reaching muzzle snuffles
At the most ancient star.


*


The innocent alone approach evil
Without fear; in their appointed flame
They acknowledge all living things.
The only evil is doubt; the only good
Is not death, but life. To be is to love.
This I thought as I stood while the snow
Fell in that bitter place, and the riders
Rode their motionless sleds into a nowhere
Of sleep. Ah, God, we can walk so easily,
Bed with women, do every business
That houses and roads are for, scratch
Our shanks and lug candles through
These caves; but, God, we can't believe,
We can't believe in anything.
Because nothing is pure enough.
Because nothing will ever happen
To make us good in our own sight.
Because nothing is evil enough.


*


I squat on my heels, raise my head
To the moon, and howl.
I dig my nails into my sides,
And laugh when the snow turns red.
As I bend to drink,
I laugh at everything that anyone loves.


All your damn horses climbing to heaven 




That should be obvious
Of course it won't
Any fool knows that.
Even in the winter.
Consider for a moment.
What?
Consider what!
They never have.
Why now?
Certainly it means nothing.
It's all a lie.
What else could it be?
That's right.
Sure.
Any way you look at it.
A silk hat.
A fat belly.
A nice church to squat in.
My holy ass...
What should they care about?
It's quaint.
Twelve kids on the fire escape...
Flowers on the windowsill...
You're damn right.
That's the way it is.
That's just the way it is. 




The snow is deep on the ground.
Always the light falls
Softly down on the hair of my belovèd.


This is a good world.
The war has failed.
God shall not forget us.
Who made the snow waits where love is.


Only a few go mad.
The sky moves in its whiteness
Like the withered hand of an old king.
God shall not forget us.
Who made the sky knows of our love.


The snow is beautiful on the ground.
And always the lights of heaven glow
Softly down on the hair of my belovèd. 


 To leave the earth was my wish, and no will stayed my rising.
Early, before sun had filled the roads with carts
Conveying folk to weddings and to murders;
Before men left their selves of sleep, to wander
In the dark of the world like whipped beasts.

I took no pack. I had no horse, no staff, no gun.
I got up a little way and something called me,
Saying,
'Put your hand in mine. We will seek God together.'
And I answered, 'It is your father who is lost, not mine.'
Then the sky filled with tears of blood, and snakes sang. 


We go out together into the staring town
And buy cheese and bread and little jugs with
flowered labels

Everywhere is a tent where we put on our whirling
show

A great deal has been said of the handless serpents
Which war has set loose in the gay milk of our
heads

But because you braid your hair and taste like
honey of heaven
We go together into town to buy wine and
yellow candles. 




If in a shimmering room the babies came. 
Drawn close by dreams of fledgling wing. 
It was because night nursed them in its fold. 

Night nursed not him in whose dark mind 

The clambering wings of birds of black revolved^ 

Making harsh torment of the solitude. 

The walker in the moonlight walked alone> 

And in his heart his disbelief lay cold. 

His broad-brimmed hat came close upon his eyes. 

FROM THE MISERY OF DON JOOST 

I have finished my combat with the sun; 
And my body, the old animal^ 
Knows nothing more. 

The powerful seasons bred and killed, 
And were themselves the genii 
Of their own ends. 

Oh, but the very self of the storm 
Of sun and slaves, breeding and death, 
The old animal — 

The senses and feeling, the very sound 
And sight, and all there was of the storm — 
Knows nothing more. 


Wallace Stevens 



THE DOCTOR OF GENEVA 



The doctor of Geneva stamped the sand 
That lay impounding the Pacific swell. 
Patted his stove-pipe hat and tugged his shawl. 

Lacustrine man had never been assailed 
By such long-rolling opulent cataracts, 
Unless Racine or Bossuet held the like. 

He did not quail. A man so used to plumb 
The multifarious heavens felt no awe 
Before these visible, voluble delugings. 

Which yet found means to set his simmering mind 
Spinning and hissing with oracular 
Notations of the wild, the ruinous waste, 

Until the steeples of his city clanked and sprang 

In an unburgherly apocalypse. 

The doctor used his handkerchief and sighed. 

GUBBINAL 

That strange flower, the sun. 
Is just what you say. 
Have it your way. 

The world is ugly. 
And the people are sad. 

That tuft of jungle feathers, 
That animal eye, 
Is just what you say. 

That savage of fire, 
That seed — 
Have it your way. 

The world is ugly, 
And the people are sad. 



THE SNOW MAN 

One must have a mind of winter 
To regard the frost and the boughs 
Of the pine-trees crusted with snow; 

And have been cold a long time 

To behold the junipers shagged with ice, 

The spruces rough in the distant glitter 

Of the January sun; and not to think 
Of any misery in the sound of the wind, 
In the sound of a few leaves, 

Which is the sound of the land 

Full of the same wind 

That is blowing in the same bare place 


Wallace Stevens 



For the listener, who listens in the snow, 

And, nothing himself, beholds 

Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is. 



TEA AT THE PALAZ OF HOOK 

Not less because in purple I descended 
Th» western day through what you called 
The loneliest air, not less was I myself. 

What was the ointment sprinkled on my beard? 
What were the hymns that buzzed beside my ears? 
What was the sea whose tide swept through me there? 

Out of my mind the golden ointment rained, 
And my ears made the blowing hymns they heard. 
I was myself the compass of that sea: 

I was the world in which I walked, and what I saw 

Or heard or felt came not but from myself; 

And there I found myself more truly and more strange. 



THE CUBAN DOCTOR 

I went to Egypt to escape 

The Indian, but the Indian struck 

Out of his cloud and from his sky. 

This was no worm bred in the moon, 
Wriggling far down the phantom air, 
And on a comfortable sofa dreamed. 

The Indian struck and disappeared. 
I knew my enemy was near — I, 
Drowsing in summer's sleepiest horn. 



ANOTHER WEEPING WOMAN 

Pour the unhappiness out 
From your too bitter heart, 
Which grieving will not sweeten. 

Poison grows in this dark. 
It is in the water of tears 
Its black blooms rise. 

The magnificent cause of being — 
The imagination, the one reality 
In this imagined world — 

Leaves you 

With him for whom no phantasy moves. 

And you are pierced by a death. 




Wallace Stevens 



OF THE MANNER OF ADDRESSING CLOUDS 

Gloomy grammarians in golden gowns> 

Meekly you keep the mortal rendezvous, 

Eliciting the still sustaining pomps 

Of speech which are like music so profound 

They seem an exaltation without sound. 

Funest philosophers and ponderers, 

Their evocations are the speech of clouds. 

So speech of your processionals returns 

In the casual evocations of your tread 

Across the stale, mysterious seasons. These 

Are the music of meet resignation; these 

The responsive, still sustaining pomps for you 

To magnify, if in that drifting waste 

You are to be accompanied by more 

Than mute bare splendors of the sun and moon. 



OF HEAVEN CONSIDERED AS A TOMB 

What word have you, interpreters, of men 
Who in the tomb of heaven walk by night, 
The darkened ghosts of our old comedy? 
Do they believe they range the gusty cold. 
With lanterns borne aloft to light the way. 
Freemen of death, about and still about 
To find whatever it is they seek? Or does 

That burial, pillared up each day as porte 
And spiritous passage into nothingness, 
Foretell each night the one abysmal night, 
When the host shall no more wander, nor the light 
Of the steadfast lanterns creep across the dark? 
Make hue among the dark comedians. 
Halloo them in the topmost distances 
For answer from their icy Elys6e. 

THE LOAD OF SUGAR-CANE 

The going of the glade-boat 
Is like water flowing; 

Like water flowing 
Through the green saw-grass, 
Under the rainbows; 

Under the rainbows 
That are like birds, 
TuQiing, bedizened. 

While the wind still whistles 
As kildeer do. 

When they rise 
At the red turban 
Of the boatman. 


Wallace Stevens 

HIBISCUS ON THE SLEEPING SHORES 

I say now, Fernando, that on that day 
The mind roamed as a moth roams, 
Among the blooms beyond the open sand; 

And that whatever noise the motion of the waves 
Made on the sea-weeds and the covered stones 
Disturbed not even the most idle ear. 

Then it was that that monstered moth 
Which had lain folded against the blue 
And the colored purple of the lazy sea, 

And which had drowsed along the bony shores, 
Shut to the blather that the water made. 
Rose up besprent and sought the flaming red 

Dabbled with yellow pollen — red as red 

As the flag above the old caf6 — 

And roamed there all the stupid afternoon. 

Wallace Stevens 



FROM CITY LANES 

The dawn comes to me sweetly^ as a soft new child 
Leans with its soul to drain a bit of milk. 
And I am new. 

gray old city^ 

Lift your head a moment from the pots and streets — 
fVash over me your meaning as a flask of fire 
Tipped and spilled over at the altar* s base. 

There are new augurings that go in blue-gray smoke 
Up from your shops y 

New lips that rain a torrent in me as of words. 
Be still a moment y cityy while the dawn tells tales. 

CITY WED 

1 lie by the bricks at night — 

Do you think I am lying by you, 

And this is your breast I lean against? 

No. Bricks are my lord — 

With them I shall procreate, 

Until I wake some morning with my litter of stone. 

Not that I want to lie with bricks, 

O beloved of the white limbs and strong neck! 

But how can I help it when they come tumbling — 

These bricks that come fumbling 

At my breast?

IF 



If it were not for this dream upon me, 

I should make my coin; 

I should grind my way to fortune with the little wheels, 

I should count the flying heels my slaves to bind, 

I should count the eardrums and the fingers mine. . . . 

But I keep thinking I can touch the sky 

With my lips. 

ELEVATOR MAN 

You in your little cage and I in mine. 

Elevator man. 

We will pierce the wide world's heaven 

Far as we can: 

You to go up and down, beating up and down; 

I to brush my wings ofF 

On the walls of Merchant Town. 

BEREFT

1 am crying to you piteously as a hungry bird, 
I am crying to you for your beautiful ports 
And harbors. 

For the slow beauty of your Statue and its silent hope. 
O my country, I would slink into the crevices of your 

egoism. 
And squat on the doormat of your excellences.

POETRY: A Magazine of Ferse 

But what shall I do when mad spring comes, 
And blossoms come, 
And wild sap comes — 
But my lover comes not? 

O my country, I might be a thin thread in your flag, 
Or the little wind blowing your ships to sea; 
But what shall I do when the spring comes in, 
And flowers shoot up in me? 



OLD MAN 

Dawn sprang wildly to her lips, 

And the little hard breasts burst as a waterfall over the 

rocks. 
I, the dark pine at the precipice edge. 
Lunged and was still; 
Then swiftly, as wild birds go to the kill. 
Toppled, and ran with her youth to the sea. 

They said I was wanton and cruel 

To have taken her youth at the height. 

To have matched the great might 

Of my years 

With her slender beauty and tremulous fears. 

I tell you, I lunged and was still; 

Then swiftly, as wild birds go to the kill, 


Loureine Aber 



Toppled, and ran with her youth to the sea. 
Pity me! 

GIRL 

Dreamily, girl — 

Duskily, night, 

Cover your dead. 

Make a plot by the old stream's head. 

Plant him and pray 

Till worlds make way 

And the blooms come. 

Duskily, night — 
Dreamily, girl. 

DEATH 



I am waiting for the white winds to come. 

White with the long-whispering dust, 

Withered under hoofs and feet. 

White with the mountains that blow their sleep 

Into the sea. 

I am waiting for the white winds to come. 

Lifting their hands as beautiful women clad for the moon; 

And soon, ah soon, 

Lifting my heart to be ashes and wind.

POEMS 

JOY 

Joy, Joy, run over me 

Like water over a shining stone; 

And I beneath your sweet shall be 

No longer hungry and alone. 

The light at my heart's gate is lit — 

My love, my love is tending it! 

CEREMONY 

The unpeopled conventional rose garden 

Is where I shall take my heart 

With this new pain. 

Clipped hedge and winter-covered beds 

Shall ease its hurt. 

When it has grown quiet, 

I shall mount the steps, slowly, 

And put three sorrows in the terra-cotta urn 

On that low gate-pillar. 

And leave them there, to sleep, 

Beneath the brooding stillness of a twisted pine. 

FIRST COMER 

Gold bee, 

You cling too still and drowsily 


Maurine Smith 

In the frosty noon. 

Think you 

The dandelion is a sun 

To warm your body through? 

WIND 

Gulls take veering way 

Through the fresh day; 

Crisp brown oak-leaves whirl and rise. 

Though my heart flies, 

I must go 

Carefully and slow. 

Eager is the wind> shy 

As any butterfly — 

ril not blur life with my frosty breath, 

Nor think again of death ! 

SWALLOWS BRUSH A POOL 

Let there be end of talk of good and evil, 
Thirst, hunger and the rest . . . Beauty has given 
The white gift of a cherry petal 
To brood upon.

THREE SMALL POEMS 



TO GET WISDOM 

I will spread out my mind 
As the wind spreads the skies; 
I will make my heart Argus, 
Full of love's eyes: 
So shall I grow 
Abysmally wise. 

MEEKNESS AND PRIDE 

Meekness and Pride 
Are fruits of one tree; 
Eat of them both 
For mastery: 
Take one of Pride — 
Of the other, three. 

COURAGE

Courage is armor 

A blind man wears, 

The calloused scar 

Of outlived despairs : 

Courage is Fear

NOT IN THE WHIRLWIND 

Do I speak soft and little — 

Do I offer you a drop of honey in a bent brown leaf? 

Yet I too have been rent by the whirlwind: 

I have lain trembling under its bellowings; 

I have endured its fangs; 

I have heard it hiss and groan, "Bitterness, bitterness!" 

But all I have left, 

After its searchings and its rendings. 

May be told in a soft voice 

And is sweet — 

Sweet, 

Like a drop of thick honey in a bent brown leaf. 

Karle Wilson Baker 



KEEP MY HAND 

Keep my hand, because I am afraid 

To be alone — 
I am afraid of all the dreams I made. 

If you were shown 
Dream after little dream that I made gay 
To keep my spirit strong upon the way, 
You would hold my hand closer than you do 

Within your own! 

Louise Driscoll 


UNDER THE CLIFF 

SHADOW CANYON 

The earth has carved a hollow cup. 

In which, most delicately set. 
Tall redwood boughs are lifted up, 

To form a sky-enlacing net. 

There, on the ground made green with fern. 
The sunshine lies in pools of light; 

And iris holds a fragile urn, 
With morning's gems of dew bedight. 

There is no sound but water going. 
And sunlight thrilling through the air. 

There is no breath but breezes blowing. 
And wild quail rustling to their lair. 

Here is a deep and drowsing haven, 
That woven sun-rays pierce and cross; 

And on the peaceful trees are graven 
The little footprints of the moss. 

Sweet dreaming canyon, shadow-bound 
Yet sunshine-stippled all the day, 

The calm skies circle you around. 
But you lie deeper hushed than they!

THEMES 



"I remember" and "I wish*'— 

Of such stuff are poems fashioned; 
Poems lyric with regret, 

Vibrant poems> dream-impassioned. 

In your honor and your praise 

I would strike a richer chord. 
Sing: "I have you and am yours, 

O adorer and adored!" 

WILL IT BE LIKE THIS? 

Will it be like this?— 

Climbing the hill at midnight. 

While the rain seeps from the plumaged pepper-trees, 

And the damp air is rank with eucalyptus; 

And our little house black and untenanted. 

Soundless, where your hurrying footsteps 

Used to run to the door to greet me; 

Black, and cold, and I alone there? 

Will that be the way of it, 

On that silent day when I shall begin waiting 

For Death to release me to you?

SIC PASSIM 

The Angel. Now here's the road to Allencourt, 
And here's the road to Tyre. 
And he who goes to Allencourt 
Is purged of all desire. 

The Youth. But what of him who goes to Tyre, 

Among the cedar trees? 
The Angel. Why, he who goes to Tyre has none 

But just himself to please. 

While he who goes to Allencourt 
Across the Hills of Pain 
Must love his fellow very well. 
And count no thing as gain 

That wounds another. He must keep 
His eyes upon the crest 
Of that high'hill, where he at last 
Through virtue shall find rest. 

The Youth, But what of him who goes to Tyre, 

Along the road of ease? 
The Angel. Why, he who goes to Tyre has none 

But just himself to please; 

While he who goes to Allencourt, 
And does not lose his way 
Among the thorns and brambles, comes 
To rich reward some day. 


Joseph Andrew Galahad 

The Old Man, Ah, why are thorns and brambles set 

To make the road a care? 
The AngeL Why, man himself, most carelessly, 

Has placed the brambles there. 

The Youth. But what of him who goes to Tyre 

Beside the sunny seas? 
The AngeL Why, he who goes to Tyre has none 

But just himself to please. 

The Old Man. And what's the toll to Allencourt? 
The Youth. And what's the toll to Tyre? 
The AngeL Why, he who goes to Allencourt 
Is purged of all desire. 

The toll is love — a brother's love — 
For man in full sincerity. 
And all the peace that God has willed 
Is the reward — eternally. 

But toll upon the other road 
Is crucible of burn and freeze: 
For he who goes to Tyre has none 
But just himself to please. 

While he who goes to Allencourt 

Is purged of all desire . . . 
The Old Man. Lord, lead me on to Allencourt! 
The Youth. For me, I go to Tyre.

Too fast the silly white-^aps run 

Their helter-skelter races; 
They stumble when the goal is won 

And fall upon their faces.

The greener ocean shadows, 
Like clover on the cooler depths 

Of grass in upland meadows.

The sea hangs kelp upon the sand 

Like garlands on a grave. 
Mourning the dead and silent land 

With every living wave.

With which the sea is drenched.

SONG 



These are the words of the wind: 

Over your white body shall pass 

Whorls of water, whorls of light. 

Of the lustre of blown glass. 
These are the words of the wind. 

You are beloved of the silence 

And the grey still rain. 
Once the sun loved you utterly, 

And shall love you again. 

These are the words of the wind: 

Over your white body shall pass 

Whorls of water, whorls of light, 

Of the lustre of blown glass. 
These are the words of the wind. 

LAKE 

You are a broad white lake, 

Silent. 

On your surface people launch their brown sun-warmed 

souls. 
Reflected in you, they see themselves 
Tall, profound, mystical. 


COMMENT 

POETRY AND THE ALLIED ARTS 

P>OETRY would like to celebrate its ninth birthday 
-1^ by inaugurating a closer affiliation with the allied 
arts of music and the drama — perhaps also the dance. 
If the movies, and the scarcely less photographic commer- 
cial plays, are banishing poetry from one end of the stage, 
it must needs go around to the other door, and re-enter 
hand in hand with the opera and lyric song, with the 
ballet, and perhaps, paradoxically, symbolic pantomine. 
Times are changing, and the arts with them — the poet, 
the composer, the dancer should prove their pliancy, 
their mobility. They should not — indeed, they cannot — 
stay apart; they must get together and co-operate, and 
accept each other's influence. 

At present our poets and composers move in different 
orbits, have scarcely a bowing acquaintance with each 
other either personally or professionally. Poetry would 
be grateful for suggestions as to the best available method 
of establishing closer relations. 

Not long ago Musical America published an article 
by Charles Albert Case, a well-known tenor, entitled 
The ^uest of the American Songy and sub-titled A Chal- 
lenge to Poets rather than Composers. Mr. Case thinks 
that the American public wants American songs, and 
that the singers are eager for this change from the usual 
polyglot programs, but that it is impossible to make up 

a sufficiently interesting and varied recital without 

foreign aid. And for this condition he thinks our poets 

are more to blame than our musicians. He says: 

The fact that there are few American tongs which are truly great is a 
challenge to American poets rather than to American composers. The 
question "what to sing" is the most vital and the most persistently 
intrusive one that a busy song recitalist has to face. Naturally American 
singers want very much to sing American songs, and most of us do sing 
them, but in building our recital programs we invariably fincl ourselves 
limited in the number of such songs we can use; for we must avoid singing 
a succession x>f songs in the same humor, and when one is face to face 
with the assembled material one finds that the contrasting elements 
which make for essential variety in the "group unit" are astonishingly 
lacking. 

Mr. Case then contrasts our meagreness with German 
and French richness, and continues: 

Being a loyal American, I admit it reluctantly, but there is far less 
variety in American songs, even when one plans to choose a group from 
several different composers, than one can find in any single one of the 
greater German song-writers. . . . 

We have some splendid American songs and some of them are truly 
noble, but most of them are not good enough. Many of the most 
successful of them are settings by other than American poets. Some of 
the best of them are not even in English! 

Mr. Case then reminds us that a good song must unite 
two arts — a fundamental truth which both singers and 
auditors too often forget. He inquires, "What con- 
stitutes a good song?" and answers his query thus: 

j1 good poem adequately set to music. There is the whole matter in a 
nutshell. 

Hie many bad American songs are bad either because the text was 
trivial to b^n with, or else was carelessly read and consequently 
inadequately interpreted in music. In some cases the text was even 


Poetry and the Allied Arts 

"adapted" — distorted, pinched and pulled into the approximate shape 
of a ready-made melody. Ready-made melodies are like ready-made 
clothes. They fit nobody because they were made to fit everybody. 

Schubert read Mueller, Goethe, Heine, Rueckert, Uhland, Shake- 
q)eare. Schumann read Rueckert, Geibel, Uhland, EichendorfiF, 
Moerike. Chansson read DeLisle and Gautier. These men read the 
best poetry of thdr time, and they read it with true understanding and 
genuine respect. What greatness there was in them lay largely in their 
power to discriminate, to select fine poetry from the mediocre, and then 
to bend to the task of making worthy musical settings. Too often our 
young Americans write as though they thought the lyrics of which they 
try to make songs were not good enough for them. . • . 

I have firequendy been asked by young aspiring composers to help 
them find words to set to music. They say: " You know— something you 
consider singable. I haven't time to read." This is rank impudence. 
I never offer such people much sympathy. I do not think they should 
be encouraged. It seems to me that one must read much poetry to 
onderstand a little. Reading, and reading with unusual intelligence, is 
part of a song-writer's job. 

Thus far Mr. Case's indictment accuses the composers, 

but he concludes with a fling at the poets: 

I have real sympathy for the trained, educated, honest-intentioned 
American composer who reads native poets and finds so little to inspire 
him to exercise his genius. Surely his material is limited. Eventually 
we shall have truly noble American songs. But first there must be 
noUe American poetry. From the mass of it the song-writer must 
choose with a fine exercise of discrimination. We have many Americans 
who have the taste to choose and the ability adequately to set beautiful 
poetry to music. But American song-writing is at the same stage of 
development as American poetry. Let us hope that some of the lyrically 
gifted will start soon to write about something besides the sunset and 
the skyline from the Jersey shore, or the sensation of ascending Wool- 
worth tower in a modem elevator! 

Now, with all due deference to Mr. Case and his 
''trained, educated, honest-intentioned American com- 

poser," we doubt whether either one of them has sym- 
pathetically investigated the extraordinary range and 
variety of modern American poetry. We doubt whether 
either one of them, having discovered a poet suggestive 
for his purpose, has ever tried to get acquainted with 
him, even if he was a neighbor, and discuss this highly 
interesting esthetic problem on which the future of 
American song depends. 

There is among American artists — ^poets, musicians, 
and all the others — a curious professionsd aloofness which 
fights against co-operation. The architect makes his 
design, the sculptor models his isolated figure, the painter 
paints his easel picture, all separate and alone — they do 
not get together, as in the Phidian or the Gothic age, or 
the Renaissance, to pool their energies and make a 
grand, complete and monumental building. In the 
same infertile way the poet writes his poem apart in his 
traditional garret; and the musician, seeking a song 
poem, or a ballet motive, or an opera libretto, reads in 
his library uncharted seas of poetry, history and romance 
instead of going where modern poetry is created and 
swinging into its current, so that the two arts may move 
along together and mutually inspire each other. 

Among themselves poets — and doubtless musicians, 
painters, and the rest — are free-and-easy enough in 
intercourse and criticism. But this professional aloof- 
ness, this shyness, comes in the way of attempts at co- 
operation. A distinguished Chicago composer says he 


Poetry and the Allied Arts 

is "very familiar" with the work of certain equally dis- 
tinguished Illinois poetS) though, to his regret, he has 
never succeeded in harnessing up their poetry to his 
music; but we doubt if he has ever attempted to work 
together with any modern poet, in the frank give-and-take 
of such a partnership, toward the production of a wholly 
modern and American work of art. When I protest 
against his going back to the nineties for a pseudo- 
romantic motive for a ballet, when I suggest Stevens or 
Kreymborg, H. D. or Edna Millay, he answers by what 
might be called a flank attack: 

I am yeiy grateful to you for the copies of Poetry which you sent 
to me containing the Stevens and Kreymborg pieces. I like particularly 
the Three Traoe/ers, although I doubt whether I could improve it any 
with music. 

It seems to me that the thing we must all remember in talking about 
an opera libretto is the fact that we must depend for our effect on the 
poetry or the drama of the action rather than on the poetry or drama of 
the words. Therefore, the ideal opera librettist would be the poet gone 
dumb who, by his simple gesture, could make us jump through any 
hoop he pleases. 

But even if this composer and others are turning 
toward pantomime and ballet rather than opera, pre- 
ferring the orchestra to the human voice, even so they 
cannot eliminate the poet; for though no word be said, 
no song sung, the imaginative invention of some poet, 
dead or living, must furnish the motive,, the story, the 
plot. And no doubt the ballet of the future will include 
the poem either as an introductory recitative or a series 
of lyric, perhaps choral, interludes; as in Rimsky-Kor- 

sakov's ballet-opera, The Golden Cockerel. Thus it is for 
the composer to choose whether he will be true to his own 
age and race by linking up with modern poets and de- 
riving his stimulus from imaginations now actively 
functioning; or go back to dead poets for his motive, and 
thereby run the risk of endangering the vitality of his 
own art, of not connecting it up with either the present 
or the past. 

But however important ballet and pantomime may 
prove as motives for modern music, it is safe to predict 
that the human voice will not lose its prestige. And it 
must be safe to predict that the sooner our composers 
look to their poet-neighbors for the texts of opera, oratorio, 
cantata, song-cycle, ballad, madrigal, song, instead of 
searching all ages, myths and languages of the past, the 
sooner will our musical art become as up-to-date and as 
racially expressive as the musical art of Russia. 

Something has been done, no doubt. The present 
writer would be ungrateful not to recall Mr. Chadwick's 
fine choral and orchestral setting of the lyrics in The 
Columbian Ode. Another effective instance is John 
Carpenter's beautiful setting of Tagore's lyrics from an 
early number of Poetry. And we are permitted to 
announce an oratorio, which is to be the joint creation 
of Louise Ayres. Garnett and Henry Hadley, the text of 
which will appear, under the title Resurganty in Poetry 
for December. But such instances are isolated cases; 
they do not yet represent a general tendency. 


Poetry and the Allied Arts 

If Poetry can do anything toward such a tendency 
by making poets and composers more aware of each 
other, bringing them more in contact personal and 
spiritual, we should be most happy to offer to the utmost 
any service in our powen And we shall be very glad 
of discussion and su^estions. H. M. 

INFLUENCE OF THE ART-THEATRE ON POETIC DRAMA 

If the new movement in the theatre had accomplished 
nothing else, it would nevertheless be justified by the 
release it has brought to poetic drama and to the poetic 
mood in drama. The new movement, long since estab- 
lished in continental Europe, still struggles precariously 
in the virgin soil of America. It exists, however; and 
having existed thus far, it probably will continue to exist 
until in time it flourishes. 

Meanwhile, by the creation of a modern technique, 
it offers poetic drama in English the first justifiable hope 
of escape from the senile lethargy into which three cen- 
turies of imitation had plunged it. Strictly speaking, 
there had been no poetic drama since the Puritans stopped 
the rich stream of Elizabethan eloquence by closing the 
theatres in 1642. Occasionally a dramatist, deriving his 
method from a compromise between the continentals, 
the Greeks and Shakespeare, had made a play in verse; 
or, more stagnantly, had built a romantic hodge-podge, 
verbose and rhetorical, around the pseudo-realistic 

formula of the days of gas-lamp illumination. But there 
had been no impetus, no technical incentive, towards a 
renascence of poetic drama until the new movement 
cleansed the theatre by challenging theatric values. 

"To save the theatre," said Eleanora Duse, "the 
theatre must first be destroyed." And the younger men, 
the revolutionists, set themselves to destroy it in theory, 
and to recreate it in practice and theory both, by the 
simple but incisive idea of re-iheatralization. No better 
proof could be offered of the sterility of poetic drama than 
the fact that these men were all, without exception, men 
of the theatre — directors, scenic artists, actors — none of 
them playwrights. In other words, the new movement 
differed from any earlier developments of the kind, so 
far as I know, in being almost wholly independent of the 
drama. The emphasis was shifted decisively from the 
drama to the theatre as the dominant art form. 

Now, that habit of mind which insists that the theatre 
shall be the handmaid of the arts, and particularly of the 
art of writing, is apt to view such a transfer of emphasis 
with alarm. For the theatre to assert its own inherent 
vitality is permissible so long as it does not intrude this 
vitality into the sacred traditions of the drama. But 
the new movement involves an esthetic too fundamental 
not to re-open the entire problem of dramatic construc- 
tion. Concerned chiefly with the production of the 
play in the theatre, it uncovers an esthetic resource that 
touches the very definition of poetic drama. 


Influence of the Art-theatre on Poetic Drama 

The reform in stagecraft is a protest against the fal- 
lacy of a realistic technique, against that ineptitude of 
the mise en scene which has made "theatrical" a syn- 
onym for the imitation of beauty by tinsel and exagger- 
ation. It is toward a simplified and therefore an 
allusive and poetic decoration, toward an emotional 
and therefore a poetic use of light, toward a rhythmic and 
therefore a poetic movement. In synthesizing these vis- 
ual elements into an organic whole, the new stagecraft has 
released in them a dramatic value entirely apart from 
representation. Just as poetry is the rhythmic expres- 
sion of a theme to be developed by words, so these visual 
elements in the theatre serve both the purpose of repre- 
sentation and of rhythmic beauty. Thus, the background 
may be both a statement of locality, and a design holding 
the production in key. Movement may be utilized not 
only for its obvious and objective purpose, but also for 
the intrinsic beauty of motion. Light, treated emotion- 
ally, is capable of following, emphasis^ing, or even leading 
the mood of the action. 

I have attempted briefly to indicate the trend of the 
new stagecraft because in this discovery of an independent 
esthetic resource in the visual elements of the theatre 
originates the essential difference between the new tech- 
nique and the old, as it affects the dramatist. The central 
rhythm of the play, instead of being developed through 
words only, is developed through all the media of pro- 
duction — through light, stage decoration and movement 

as well as through the spoken word. These visual elements 
become a part of the inner structure of the play; and 
because of their poetic quality they bind the theatre 
inseparably to poetry, to poetic drama, making the 
theatre a place well fitted for the renascence of poetic 
drama. 

But with these additional factors of expression, it is no 
longer necessary for the dramatist to trust so exclusively, 
and cling so tenaciously, to words. In the Elizabethan 
drama even the locality of the scene was often stated in 
words: every mood, every emotion was projected verbally. 
It was a drama of eloquence; and as such it suited, as no 
other form could, the torrential flood of Elizabethan 
poetry. But modem poetry, irrespective of the drama, is 
more restrained; it tends to leave much unsaid, to project 
the meaning by ellipsis and overtones. Unless I am mis- 
taken, though I know little of the technique of poetry, 
this brevity is sometimes carried to extreme lengths, in 
which the imagination of the reader supplies much more 
at the poet's instigation than the poet himself expresses. 
It is a subtle technique; and it is pre-eminently the 
technique of the dramatist. 

With this distinction: that, instead of restraining verbal 
expression to stimulate the imagination of the reader, the 
dramatist uses words cautiously in adjustment to the 
other media of his expression. To take an obvious, and 
well understood, example: a gesture is sometimes equal 
in effectiveness to many words. In the theiatre^ where 


Influence of the ArMheatre on Poetic Drama 

economy of expression is imperative, gesture and words 
will often complement each other without duplication. 
And what is true of gesture becomes true in the art- 
theatre of all phases in movement, of stage decoration, of 
light; and on occasign of music. 

The effect of this upon the poetry of the poetic drama, 
and especially upon verse structure, is significant and far- 
reaching. It necessitates the development of a verse form 
that will admit of distortions, interruptions and irreg- 
ularities. These are more apparent than real. As soon 
as the poetic drama is conceived as a fusion of many arts 
into an organic whole, the rhythm of the play becomes an 
inclusive rhythm to the progression of which all the media 
are contributory and in a sense subordinate. The irreg- 
ularities in such a drama would be due to the separation 
of the verse from its theatric context. When the play 
came into being in the theatre these irregularities would 
disappear, merging into the larger current of rhythmic 
beauty. To the dramatist this may seem the weakness 
or the strength of the new poetic drama — that it comes to 
fulfilment only in the theatre, as a symphony lives only in 
the orchestra. 

Blank verse, which alone of the standard forms has 
been accepted as a proper medium for the poetic drama in 
English, depends for acceptance upon an insidious flexi- 
bility. This flexibility serves the purpose of the theatre 
so long as the characters keep talking. But talk they 
must; and the terrified volubility of the poetic drama is, 

I think, one of the reasons why it has been in general a 
form displeasing to modern audiences. This is no fault of 
blank verse, which has been deflected from its original and 
legitimate intention to serve as best it might an art that 
lacks its own form. It has thus created a compromise 
between the printed page and the theatre which has made 
the poetic drama neither fish nor flesh, neither wholly 
satisfactory for reading nor wholly satisfactory for acting. 
Moreover, the need for well-rounded periods has reacted 
upon the dramatist by giving him a false sense of 
untroubled leisure. The time element, which scarcely 
exists in the printed page, is in the theatre of the utmost 
importance. The reader may take his own pace: the 
auditor must listen; he must accept the pace of the actor. 
The verse is spoken apparently with a retarded movement, 
and must therefore be quantitatively less, and more com- 
pact for the purpose. Such a compactness is hostile, one 
would say, judging by examples, to the mood of blank 
verse. One need only refer, among many instances, to the 
plays of Stephen Phillips or Zoe Akins, each of whom has 
a keen dramatic instinct; or to that parody of Elizabethan 
grandeur, that reductio ad absurdum of rhetoric in a theme 
not without power, Caius Gracchus^ to note the clogging 
result of the intrusion of the stricter verse forms into the 
theatre. It may almost be stated as a generality that, 
other things being equal, the more smoothly a play reads 
the worse it will act. 


Influence of the Art-theatre on Poetic Drama 

A new verse form that wiU be native to the theatre, that 
will be an inseparable component of the flow of the com- 
plex rhythm of the play, cannot be created out of hand. 
It too, like the modification of painting for stage decora- 
tion, of illumination for emotional lighting, must develop 
through knowledge of the exigencies of the medium. To 
understand the poetic theatre is to understand the use of 
poetry in that theatre. In America the dramatist has 
grasped neither the technique nor the possibilities in 
expression that it offers him. Toy plays, G)lumbine 
plays, gay and adolescent trifles, thin tragedies — all 
superficial experiments in the externals of the new stage- 
craft — follow one another in an almost (but fortunately 
not quite) unbroken succession. 

In a recent article the most brilliant director that the 
new movement has produced this side the Atlantic, 
Maurice Browne, summarizes thus the situation in respect 
of finding a drama for the art-theatre: 

Afight which has hardly begun: the fight for M^pAzy. That is where 
the Chicago Little Theatre failed, and where all the artist-groups in 
America have failed, except perhaps the Provincetown Players. 

But it may be true that out of a clearer understanding 
will come the dramatist who will evolve the form which 
his medium demands. And after him — the deluge.

REVIEWS 

MUSEUM SHIPS 

Ships in HarboTy by David Morton. G. P. Putnam's Sons. 

What is there in David Morton's verse that seems to 
save it, that intervenes in moments of irritation with its 
punctual urbanity? There is not an original line in it. 
Not one cry, one intense expression comes from it; one 
vision, that the poet has kept from his privileged dreaming, 
which can draw the mind an inch out of even the shallowest 
rut. 

Is it- its cleanly manufacture, its unstraying measures 
and kempt familiar figurines? To me its charm has been 
a charm too soon worn out — the charm that sometimes 
attracts us to a diffident guest when we are overborne by 
the intrusions and ineptitudes of the vivacious, when the 
quiet and subdued deceptively appear to be powerful and 
profound. 

It is fatal, however, to turn closely to the poems them- 
selves for verification. They are demure enough, but thin 
and fragile; and made with earnest and helpless plagiarism. 
Never the robust piracies of a Shakespeare or Sterne, but 
a pallid imitativeness that paints the past more ruinous 
with perfunctory restorations, and blows about it feeble 
ghosts — ^pale, mute, and not recognizable as ghosts should 
be, of any of the shapes of destiny. 

The book is called Ships in Harhor — there is such a poem 
in the book, and other occasional verses on ships. But 


Museum Ships 

the reader who expects salt and storniy or anything 
authenticaUy of the sea, should look elsewhere — in the 
dubious prose of Joseph Conrad, for instance. There are 
some conventionally nautical words and phrases, and the 
tidy thoughtfulness about mystical things that gives to 
diffident, cornered people their misleading impressiveness. 
It makes David Morton talk twice, on successive pages, of 
''weightless cargoes" — and one might add lifeless crews, 
and meaningless uses, and tinsel. The sea is brought in 
because it is on the same wall with Greece and Rome, 
spring and patriotism; and not being so bent with overuse, 
is more convenient to hang poems upon. Sonnets — for 
David Morton writes mostly in sonnets. 

We agree that grammar \s spoken language, stagnant; 
out of which nevertheless speech drips and sometimes 
splashes. We agree that rhetoric is literature, stagnant; 
that as there can be limitless variations of the correct 
sentences, phrases, clauses and what-nots of grammar, so 
there can be a limitless variation of forms of rhetoric. 
These verses are rhetoric, often skilful and surprising, 
often mildly intricate; but never poetry. 

There should be a word bearing the same relation to 
subject matter which grammar and rhetoric bear to 
language. Pageant, perhaps; but pageant is free, ringing, 
and dramatic. Pageant is play, and this other thing 
pretends solemnly to poetrjr; but uses pageant properties. 
It rounds up all the popular places and heroes, the story- 
book locales and personae,and treats them with apologetic

sophistication, and with a snuffling sentimentality very 
wide of the crude romantics of the pageant crowd. 

The favorite property is the Past. After reading this 
book through (a Spartan exercise) I turned the pages 
casually at various places to see whether the Past appeared 
as often as I thought. I read, in On Hearing a Bird at 
Night: 

Out of what ancient summers of soft airs. 

Christ, Dante, Athens, Time, Roman, pyramid, Phidias, 
are all in one sonnet called Moments; Pan and the Gods 
are in Redemption; and in Encore^ 

This old slow music . . . with dancers who were graceful long ago. 
Does Mr. Morton make a confession in Inviolate? 

For present loveliness there is no speech: 

A word may wrong a flower or face, 

And stars that swim beyond our stuttering reach 

Are safer in some golden, silent place. 

Only when these are broken, or pass by, 

Wonder and worship speak ... or sing • • • or cry. 

The thought seems more penetrating than it is. If the 
present and the future are inviolate to the pen of the poet, 
the past is equally so, and Mr. Morton should quietly 
take to other things. He knows that the past is beautiful 
only through the poets who recorded its beauty — and 
ugliness. The Past is a convention; time is a unity, and 
no fragment of it is less alive than another, unless one 
wittingly puts on blinders. 

To continue our census, this from Transfiguration: 


Museum Ships 

What old historic dust gives back the rose! 
What crumbled empires yield the creeping vine! 

And these from Survival and Ruins: 

Lead back the tragic chariots of Troy! 

The spring comes in to me like spring in Rome. 

I might add, and so on and so on, because Mr. Morton's 
obsession is the Past, and it stalks him like a shadow 
everywhere he goes; although the other commonplaces of 
poetry, the ready-rapture articles of every variety, are 
not neglected, and although he succeeds as little in 
vitalizing the past as the sea. Perhaps for him the sea 
has run out, and the past has been neatly embalmed in a 
general history. There is even a curious indifference about 
them, as if they were a poetaster's shop-talk. 

And, oh yes, the sonnets are very carefully made. 
They are trim, rhythmic, proper sonnets in every respect.

NEW FIRE 

A Canopic Jar^ by Leonora Speyer. E. P. Button & Co. 
This is the first book of a mature woman too intelligent 
to be content with gifts already fulfilled and creations 
accomplished. The book, hiding "the hidden thing, 
making protection for Hapi, who is within," indicates 
careful research into the forms of verse, and contains 
poems in various forms. The task of the reviewer is 
somewhat to disentangle the set of perceptions for which 

the development of appropriate rhetoric will yield most 
to her ambition. 

Mrs. Speyer's ambition is neither historical^ evangelical 
nor journalistic, but esthetic. This in itself is noteworthy. 
It is often said that pursuits and ideas must now be 
estimated upon their contribution to the war problem, 
the food problem, or the proletariat problem. If this 
were true, every healthy-^minded man should strive in a 
chemical laboratory to find the secret lair of energy, 
which men will control in the good day coming, so that 
drudgery will cease, and food and power become so cheap 
that they will not be worth fighting for. 

But in the meantime, if conviction fails us, or an un- 
scientific education has forever limited our activities, 
there is a phase of thought in which a gifted woman may 
participate as well as a chemist or war-correspondent^, 
these speculative adventures and flashes of interpretive 
insight, which, when fixed in pattern or rhythmic utter- 
ance, we call art. And if art is to remain as vital as 
protozoology, or, for that matter, as prize-fighting, its 
principal concern must be the search for new form, its 
own lairs of energy, however useless in the end. 

In this search Mrs. Speyer is engaged. For convenient 
examination of the book, I shall take up certain qualities 
in more or less arbitrary order. In the construction ot 
phrase which shall convey precisely a precise idea or 
impression, not a matter of verse-technique alone, her 
imagination is deft. Occasionally her abstraction is as 


New Fire 

sharp-edged as a tangible object: "O pompous cry, O 
puny sin!" These are even stronger, and cling to the 
memory: 

I am the path that my own feet tread. 

Gulls flap unevenly through the muffled hours; 
Spaces listen in hiding. 

Rhythm is of course the special problem of verse. Two 
divisions of it may be dissociated: The first indicates an 
inner logic not otherwise shown, or an emotion not other- 
wise evoked, as in traditional or imposed forms. The other 
fuses with the rhythm of the fact, as that the old man 
walked amid the green rye, so that the old man may seem 
to walk. Movement is duplicated by movement-of- 
words. Coleridge is full of examples of this: 

The moving moon went up the sky, 

And nowhere did abide: 
Softly she was going up, 

And a star or two beside. 


tinguished exponent. The lovely after-battle poem, 
April on the Battlefield— 

And birds sit close for comfort 
On broken boughs — 

Squally and First Snow on the HillSy indicate this ability. 
Curiously, although an excellent musician, she does not 
invent musical schemes which are interesting in them- 
selves. 

The American genius has taken up satire. The axe, 
which has rusted since Swift, but for such bourgeois 
holidays as Thackeray afforded, is used with new intent 
and no reformatory zeal. The bias given to perceptions 
by scorn, not spleen, is recognized to be as true an 
emotional bias as another; and perhaps, in a world of 
newspapers and languid religions, the most pertinent of 

mordant and bewildering humor of her time. It is not 
negative wit, and may not be completely conscious; but 
it strips away all hoakum, however sweet, leaving our 
intent and passion like a shell crusted with salt. There 
are traces of this trenchancy in her verse: 

O bottled widow's woe. 
Standing in ostentatious row 
Within the gloom 
Of dear departed's tomb! 
Evaporated lover's grief! 

A Canopic Jar has unpretentious beauty and clear 
thought, and no earmarks of vulgar success or sacrosanct 
largeness. She seems able to endure the inward conflict 
and sedentary work required even to 'commence art. And 
one may be sure that she will not rest upon the achieve- 
ment of this book, or repeat it in her second, betraying 
those who have faith in her. Already her Magdalene 
ballad in a recent issue of the Nation is a finer episodic 
lyric than any in this book. She is able to create passages 
of such intransient beauty as this: 


New Fire 

Does the heart grieve on 
After its grief is gone. 
Like a slow ship moving 
Across its own oblivion ? 

Who shall say that her fire in the rushes, which gives so 

fair a light, may not come to burn gold?

PAGEANTRY AND RHETORIC 

Rip Van Winkle^ by Percy Mackaye. Alfred A. Knopf. 
Two Mothers {Eight Hundred Rubles and Agrippina)^ by 

John G. Neihardt. M acmillan Co. 

The talent of Percy Mackaye lies in the field of 
pageantry; and it is no mean talent, as he proved in 
his St. Louis masque. In pageantry the picture must 
speak louder than words, and Mr. Mackaye unquestion- 
ably speaks louder with pictures than with words. For 
years he has been laboring to find his medium through 
poetry. The sensibilities of an artist, and a laudable 
ambition, have led him to fake poetry; but his words fail 
to augment or enhance his pictures. Until he* practically 
discards the use of words, he will not be a free artist. 

Rip Van Winkle has pageant values rather than poetic. 
Written as light opera, it is patterned in the usual manner 
— dialogues, lyrics, comedy, dance. It lacks the snap of 
light opera, but its pictures and ensembles are distinctly 
valuable as sublimated extravaganza, and poetically 
eflFective as pageant material. The author has a vision for 
pictorial symbolism in broad compositions filling large 

canvases, for extravagant effects to be put across great 
distamres and to register in the conglomeriate comprehen- 
sion of fifteen thousand people. 

The story of Rip Van fVinkle is a tradition. It is 
material for a drama if the protagonist. Rip — alight- 
hearted, humorous, pathetic, tragic — ^is sincerely and pro- 
foundly characterized. Playing, drinking, dreaming — the 
outcast — we want it all to the bitter end, not a sugar- 
coated substitute. Mr. Mackaye's more palatable ar- 
rangement of the story lacks the original tang. His 
tampering with the legend is like changing the theme of a 
play which has made the play. Washington Irving, 
Thomas Jefferson, Tony Sarg's puppets, all retain the old 
flavor. Mr. Mackaye's version is flat, lacks the old 
richness. 

In the beginning of Act III^ Rip for the first time takes 
the characterization familiar to us — a fantastic figure 
without locale. Later in the act he assumes the dialect 
of a New England farmer, and at the close he is suddenly 
transformed by the magic flask into a romantic youth. 

Something of a fakir and something of an artist, Mr. 
Mackaye paints living pictures on an enormous canvas in 
a public park. 

Eight Hundred Rubles^ by John G. Neihardt, is a tragic 
episode compact in scenario but unbalanced in its develop- 
ment. The long speeches, the digressions, and the song 
at the beginning of the episode, hamper the progression 
at the start. They do not, to any extent, promote suspense 


Pageantry and Rhetoric 

nor establish the exposition. In so short a play^ the 
exposition must be precipitated into the drama immedi- 
ately. Without premonition the tragedy is revealed, and 
the play is over before we know it has begun. The verse 
lacks ease, and the flow of line into line; it jolts over a 
corduroy road. 

In Agrippina he again indulges in long speeches, and 
they in turn indulge themselves to the point of licentious- 
ness iri rhetorical luxury. The licentiousness of Nero 
pales by comparison, and the delayed story grows dull. 

The stories of these two plays seem far removed, as 
does the verse; but it is possible that Mr. Neihardt's 
spirit lives and breathes and has its being in the far 
removed. All a poet can do, and all that one can demand 
of a poet, is to react honestly. The sincerity of Mr. 
Neihardt is generally acknowledged, but Bacchus cannot 
be revived by filling his cup with grape-juice. 


THE NOVELIST AS POET 

As the Wind Blows y by Eden Philpotts. Macmillan Co. 

Not a few novelists try their hand at poetry. Ap- 
parently it seems to them somehow the fitting thing to do. 
G>mmonly they write poetry which shows taste and 
literary craftsmanship rather than emotional impulse. 

Mr. Philpotts' book is of this kind. It manifests skill 
in the handling of rhyme and conventional rhythms. It 
has the sense of fitness which has characterized the 

English literary tradition for generations. It has also 
the "poetic" vocabulary and attitude which have been a 
part of the same tradition. For example: 

For June must joy though joy departs, 
And life must laugh though sorrow smarts. 
And buds must break as well as hearts. 

Most of the author's work, of course, is better than this, 
though still lacking in intensity and originality of expres- 
sion. His lighter verse, such as Gaffer* s Song and Scandal^ 
possesses humor and charm. As would be expected in the 
work of a novelist, however, the narrative poems carry 
most entertainingly the rather boyish naivet6 of subject 
and style — Tiger ^ for example; or The Fruii of the Tree^ 
which solemnly offers the suggestion that if ape or sloth 
had eaten of the Tree of Knowledge it might have ruled 
the kingdoms of the world "with kinder wit than man." 
In Tiger there is a good deal of spirit and vividness, sug- 
gested by the rattling rhythm of the opening lines: 

To the barking of the monkeys, to the shrieking of the birds; 
To the bellow of the bison and stampeding of the herds; 
At fiery edge of sunset, from the jungle to the wold. 
Death stalks in shining ebony and orange-tawny gold.

THE PROFESSOR AS CRITIC 

The Function of the Poet and Other Essays^ by James Rus- 
sell Lowell. Houghton Mifflin Co. 

The Kinds of Poetry and Other Essays y by John Erskine. 
Duffield & Co. 


The Professor as Critic 

James Russell Lowell, during his Harvard period, was 
the leading professor of English literature in the United 
States. John Erskine, now professor of English in Co- 
lumbia, has a distinguished position in academic circles 
of the present day. The earliest essay in the Lowell 
volume was originally published in 1845, ^^^ latest in 
1894. The earliest paper in Dr. Erskine 's book first ap- 
peared in 1912, the most recent in 1920. The two books 
therefore afford opportunity to compare academic criti- 
cal opinion of two quite* distinct periods. 

Few persons nowadays read Lowell 's criticism. The pre- 
face to the present volume, contributed by Albert Mordell, 
admits that some of Lowell's literary opinions **are old- 
fashioned to us", though the learned commentator char- 
acteristically claims that "Lowell, before Freud, under- 
stood the psychoanalytic theory of genius in its connec- 
tion with childhood memories." Whether or not Lowell 
realized the influence of childish repressions, it is certain 
that he is old-fashioned. He speaks a language that we 
of today are not quite at home in and are not interested 
enough to learn. His classifications, his reduction of 
criticism to scientific laws, his rhetorical style, belong to 
the journalism of an earlier day. We shall not again at- 
tire our thought in this sort of raiment, any more than 
we shall wear the kind of clothes that Mr. Lowell wore. 

This does not mean that Lowell's critical work was 
valueless. It was not. He contributed to American crit- 
icism a degree of scholarship and fairness; and, except 

when puzzled by the intrusion of a man of genius like 
Poc, he welcomedy sometimes very cordially, the new 
writer. He did much to turn criticism away from the per- 
sonal blind alleys into which it had previously been so 
often led. He is a figure of interest in the history of crit- 
icism, but we do not turn to him for guidance today. 

Dr. Erskine's book belongs to its own time as much as 
Dr. Lowell's. The difference is that Dr. Erskine's day 
is ours. His four essays make an interesting book, with 
a flavor of sly humor now and th«n which adds a zest to its 
solid value. I think the universities should require every 
student who expects to teach English literature to read it, 
not because it is the best book on poetry of the present 
day, but because it is the best on the subject for the sort 
of person who usually teaches literature. But the pub- 
lishers will probably not get out an extra edition on the 
prospect of orders from the universities. They doubtless 
know that Lowell's book is more likely to get the aca- 
demic orders than is Erskine 's. Dr. Erskine has the qual- 
ity, never forgiven by the true academician, of not l>eing 
interested in what everybody else has forgotten. 

The Erskine book is also suggestive for the poet; espe- 
cially the closing essay. Scholarship and Poetry^ in which 
the author shows the value to the poet of an unpedantic 
literary background. The essay on The New Poetry is 
hospitable to the new, but contains little material which 
the ordinary student of the movement does not already 
know. I must, however, quote one delicious sentence: 


The Professor as Critic 

"Many of the new poems do look at first a bit outrageous, 
especially to old-fashioned readers who have not read 
widely in old-fashioned literature/' 

Lowell was in tune with his time, and Erskine is with 
his. It is unfortunate that much academic criticism of 
today is living in Lowell's time instead of Erskine 's.

NOTES 

Mr. Wallace Stevens, of Hartford, G)nn., has appeared often in 
Poetry since I9i4. Two years ago his Peeksniffiana received the 
Levtnson Prize. Mr. Stevens has been a frequent and valued contributor 
to the special magazines, but he has not yet yielded to the solicitation of 
his admirers so far as to publish a volume. 

H. D. (Mrs. Richard Aldington), originally of Philadelphia but now 
usually resident in England, is also a familiar contributor since her first 
appearance in Poetry's fourth number. Her book, Sea Garden^ is 
published in America by the Houghton MiflUn Co.; and her transla- 
tions from Euripides have been issued in pamphlet form by The Egoist. 

Karle Wilson Baker (Mrs. Thos. E.), of Nacogdoches, Texas, is the 
author of Blue Smoke (Yale University Press). 

Miss Loureine Aber, of Chicago, will issue her first book before 
Christmas through Ralph Fletcher Seymour. 

Miss Louise Driscoll, of Catskill, N. Y., has contributed often to this 
magazine and others. Her tragic dialogue, Metal Checks^ received a 
prize from Poetry as the best poem printed in its War Number — Nov. 
191 4, and it remains one of the finest poems suggested by the great 
catastrophe. 

Mr. Nelson Antrim Crawford, of the faculty of the Kansas State 
Agricultural College at Manhattan, received last year a prize in a Kansas 
contest for the best poem published during the year by a resident of that 
state. The prize was awarded to The Carrying of the Ghost^ which our 
readers will remember. 

Miriam Allen deFord, who recently married Mr. Maynard Shipley, is 

now a resident of San Francisco. She has written verse and prose for 
the radical papers. 

Other contributors appear for the first time in this issue. Of these: 

Maurine Smith was a highly gifted student at the University of 
Chicago, and a valued member of its Poetry Club, when she died about 
three years ago. Her friends have collected her best poems with the 
intention of publishing a small volume to perpetuate her memory. 

Mr. Joseph Andrew Galahad, of Portland, Oregon, has contributed to 
various magazines. 

Mr. Grant H. Code, of Cambridge, Mass., is in the faculty of Boston 
University. 

Perhaps we should also remind our readers that Mr. Cloyd Head, of 
Chicago, who contributes the art>theatre article to our prose section, is 
the author of that powerful modern one-act tragedy. Grotesques^ which 
received the Lcvinson Prize in 191 6; and that Mrs. Laura Sherry, of 
Milwaukee, is the director of the Wisconsin Players, an organization 
which has been for years one of the most efficient and enlightened of the 
art-theatre companies in this country.

The New York Sunday Tribune of Jan. gih, i^i, said ediUmally, 
in quoting seven poems from our January number: 
'The varied Intereit and beauty presented are typical of 
PosntT's quality. Thanks to a nu« ootnddence of poise and gener- 
ous imagination, of sense and sensitiveness, it ranks as easfly the best 
vehide of poetry in the English language." 

In the Louden Times of Nov. asth^ iq20, we read: 

'*We need not linger over the many English and French con- 
tributors to this periodical. . . We do have to note that it has 
published, as it honestly claims, much of the best experimental 
poetry written by Americans in the past eight years. . . They have 
succeeded in their primary design— to create a poetry which should 
be American in thought, feelfaig, subject, and form. That is, after 
all, a distfaKt achievement" 

The Chicago Evening Post, in commenting on POETRY'S eighth 

birth£iy, said: 

''No editorship is infallible, but it is rather interesting and 
enlightening to look over the old numbers of Poeiht and to realize 
that the i&nt important chance for publication in America was given 
to many poets, almost unknown, wtko have since obtained fame. . . 
We wonder how many more may yet be helped. Po9TR7 is, so far 
as we know, unique in the length of its life, recognized position and 
rigorously artistic standard."

NOVEMBER 1921 



THE LIONS 

THE jungle glistens like a cloud — 
Purple-cool, tree-deep, lake-pearled; 
Where lions lurk and thrash and crowd. 

Like lands that battle for the world. 
Behold, one lion leaps for his prey. 

Trotting like a saffron mist. 
As savage nations in our day 
Pounce on some weak antagonist. 

Across the jungle-painted grass 
His roar breaks through the tropic air; 

And he runs like a tawny flame — 
Swift yellow stroke of lightning there. 

His cry is like the thunder's sound, 
Shaking leaf and bough and bole; 

tS9l 




 

And he is part of Africa — 
The yellow monarch in her soul. 

Painted birds fly through the trees 

And stain the sky with brown on blue. 
Hammering with their wings the breeze, 

Hitting songs across the dew. 
Parrots gaudy as a star 

Tap their bells and chatter sound. 
Each insect sweeps his dim guitar 

Like music hidden in the ground. 

The tawny lion goes like a shot — 

A daub of gold against the green. 
Scenting a wounded bleeding doe 

That he is following unseen. 
A spangled serpent lights a tree, 

A coiling flame around it, curled; 
But the old lion goes great and free. 

The master of his jungle world. 

Bravely born and bravely bred, 

Proud as a diamond of his fire. 
This yellow monarch of the south 

Goes like the hosts thatswarmed to Tyre. 
Hungry to kill, he scents the air. 

And roars into beginning night. 
His blond mane tossing up its hair, 

His eyes two pools of blazing light. 


Edwin Curran 



He stops and lips the evening gale, 

Reading the wind across the trees; 
Giant cat in his tawny mail, 

Spelling out the trail-warm breeze. 
Then on he darts as though with wings, 

To find his prey and drink the blood 
And feast upon the harmless things 

That God has put into the wood. 

A gorilla slouches through the bush; 

A leopard's eyes shoot stars of light; 
The deep luxuriant forest hush 

Hides serpents beetle-colored, bright. 
The crane nods sleeping, spindle-shanked; 

Gray monkeys troop and clack and peer; 
A jungle stream goes emerald-banked, 

Purring like a wild-cat near. 

The cinnamon-colored land awakes 

Around the lion fold on fold; 
Yellowing with fruit, blue with lakes. 

Stuck with fireflies burnished gold. 
Gray monkeys watch the lion and talk, 

Lassoing trees with leather tails; 
Some far palms by the seaside walk. 

And near-by sing the nightingales. 

The moon hangs like a petal of gold 
Broken upon the western sky. 

The blue dusk deepens fold on fold> 
The shattered day lies down to die. 

Here in this wild primeval place. 
Savage, wooded, poisonous, still, 

Far from mankind and human face. 
The old lion goes to hunt and kill. 

His prey is near, the scent is strong. 

He roars out in his ghastly mirth. 
There, bleeding like a shattered song, 

His wounded doe is run to earth. 
But as he leaps to take its throat 

A younger lion leaps up and cries; 
And there the two lions stand like stone. 

The fires of ages in their eyes. 

It took the centuries to make 

These lions' sun-colored bodies bright. 
These great-teethed felines from the brake. 

Tawny, crouching, cruel as night. 
Their eyes turn red — these cats of brown 

Swift as wind, lithe as air, 
Savage-maned and monarch-crowned. 

With blazing eyes and yellow hair. 

The painted snake makes not a sound; 

The frightened birds shake in the tree: 
Like two great russet clouds they bound. 

These monarchs, for the mastery. 


Edwin Curran 



The teak-tree groans, the gum is still, 
The coffee- tree nods to the duel; 

An elephant calf stares from a hill, 
A lizard watches from a pool. 

White silver moon, an eye of snow, 

Looks from the dusk with beauty hung, 
Her pale lids open and aglow 

Where starry ladders are far-flung. 
The lions' steel sinews knot in cords; 

There is a crash of yellow forms; 
The zebu and chimpanzee run; 

The jungle with the battle storms. 

A roar that rocks the ground is heard. 

And monkeys chatter, parrots flee. 
The coiled snake and the gaudy bird 

Slink from their everlasting tree. 
The colors of the painted land 

All disappear as quick as light; 
The great palms tremble, and the hand 

Of God draws over all the night. 

The dotted turtles hunt the ground. 
Now rocking with the battling pair; 

The night birds, startled, make no sound. 
The vultures scent the bloody air. 

Hyenas wait to eat the dead 
And pick the polished bones and wail; 

A python crawls with silken tread 
On silver plates of sliding mail. 

The wild things of the jungle know 

A battle of the kings is on; 
The zebras cry, the tree-cats yell; 

The tall giraffe has swiftly flown; 
The spiders hang on polished webs — 

Greenish discs of jeweled light; 
A frog is croaking in his well, 

The fireflies shower through the night. 

The two huge cats are at their duel — 

Two yellow whirlwinds, hard as stones; 
Snapping, biting, wild and cruel. 

Tearing flesh and crunching bones. 
Jaws upraised and crashing shut, 

Lifting, sinking, slashing there; 
Paws like razors slitting skin. 

Teeth like knives of white that tear. 

The painted flowers drip with blood. 

The hiding snake is crushed below; 
The lizard stamps into the ground; 

The trees shake as when whirlwinds blow. 
The monkeys swing away and run; 

The wildcat looks and leaps away; 
The leopard, spotted with the sun. 

Slides by into the mist of gray. 


Edwin Curran 



The poisonous flies have scented blood. 

And elephants have come to peer; 
Ant-eaters look into the wood 

To see the battle of the year. 
The scorpion squirms into the view, 

And things unspeakable, to see — 
Speared and horned and crusted blue. 

The toad and reptile infantry. 

The jungle sees the battle rage 

Intense, ferocious, swift and fast — 
A terrible and an awfiil sight. 

So horrible toward the last 
The lions have cowed the very night, 

And stunned the shadows and the trees: 
A scuffle like the break of worlds, 

The shattering of centuries. 

But the old lion shows greater skill, 

With harder blows and mastery; 
His teeth were longer trained to kill. 

His strength upholds his majesty. 
Yet the young lion is quick and strong — 

So wiry lithe he seems to float; 
He worries the old lion for long — 

Till the old lion leaps at his throat. 

They wave in battle, spinning round 
Together, snarling, thundering, bright, 

Thrashing through the dry dead grass; 

Until the day has turned to night> 
And left the young lion dead and still — 

In ribbons^ mangled on the sod. 
His broken body cold and chill — 

The old lion still his lord and god. 

The old master of the forest stands 

• With one paw on the fallen breast — 
The monarch of the jungle lands 

Whose victory challenges the best. 
A king is dead — long live the king! 

He roars, his eyes like coals aglow. 
He calls his mate, a lioness there, 

To come and feast and eat the doe. 

He calls his lady through the night, 

And she replies and comes to him, 
Where the dead doe lies still and white, 

To banquet in the shadows dim: 
Like nations, when the war is done. 

Who gather at the feasting board 
To dine upon the hard-won prey, 

Each like a monarch and a lord. 

The snake slips back into his tree. 
The monkeys chatter now in peace; 

And over the blue woods there falls 
The age-old night of centuries. 


Edwin Curran 



The fireflies hang their lanterns back 
To star the dark; the beetles bell; 

The lizards creep, and nigh thirds sing; 
The snail is dancing in his shell. 

The yellow floods are still and quiet; 

The sky is blue like trembling glass; 
Beasts, birds and toads and insects riot 

Beneath the stars in jungle grass. 
After the battle night alone; 

Moon-mist, ghostly poison-flowers; 
Trumpeting of beasts that moan 

Through creeping crawling crimson hours. 

A shaky moon rocks in the night, 

A grumbling sea, far palms, the crash 
Of monkeys chattering as they fight; 

Gray serpents going like a flash; 
Slow turtles, swifter bats on wing; 

Worms creeping back, and spiders, flies; 
Lizards with poisonous following, 

And fanged things in their paradise. 

Slimy silken bellies squirming. 

Offal-scented beasts of prey; 
Hungry, lethal toads and reptiles 

Who move by night and hide by day: 
Tearing flesh of birds that nest. 

Rending bones that drip with blood. 

So the jackals strike and quest 
In the world's jungle brotherhood. 

But must these creepers in their turn 

Be conquered in the coming lights 
As new hope rises on the world 

And the old lions go with the night? 
Yet who can tell what signs of death 

Await the nations one by one? 
Ah^ what will happen in earth's dark night 

Before the rising of the sun? 

Edwin Curran 




THE JILT 



Let other feet go drudging 

About the house he built! 
A free girl, a jilted girl — 

I'm glad he was a jilt. 

We quarrelled till it almost 
Destroyed my breath of life. 

He nagged me and bullied me> 
As if Vd been his wife. 

II 

We grew cold and bitter 
The more we would explain, 

And if we held our tongues 
The worse it was again. 

He flashed a cruel sign, 

I flashed a cruel word, 
And neither could forget 

The blame the other heard. 

Ill 

But his eyes could be tender with love, and his voice — 
how tender! 
Some words he sang are with me the whole day through. 

I hang out the linen and burnish the brass and copper, 
And they won't go out of my head, whatever I do. 

Strange how they come when I feel alone and forsaken, 
How they wake me up when the dawn in my room is 
hazy, 
How they drug me asleep when the night has darkened my 
pillow! 
Ah, a song will sing in your head when your heart is 
crazy! 

IV 

What can I do but sit here and shake 

And let the windows rattle mournfully. 
While Sunday brings him never and Monday brings him 
not. 

And winter hides the town away from me? — 

Dreaming how he drew my soul from my lips. 

Seeming just to hear forevermore 
What my heart tells the clock, what the clock tells my 
heart. 

Dreaming back the springtime at my door? 



Why should I curl my hair for him? 

He said the trouble couldn't be mended. 
He said it must be good-by and go; 

And he took up his hat, and all was ended. 


Agnes Lee 

So all was over. And Tm not dead! 

And I've shed all the tears Fm going to shed! 

And now he's wanting to come again? 

Perhaps he's sorry, perhaps he misses 
The hill-top girl. Well, let him come! 

But no more love and no more kisses — 
Whatever the future, gay or grim. 
Why should I curl my hair for him? 

VI 

I shall go out in the sun today. 
I don't know whether to laugh or pray, 
For along the waking paths of spring 
Bird calls to bird till the branches ring. 

Something stirs me — spring's own will — 
To wander to the edge of the hill. 
Where I can see as I look down 
Patches of green on the gray old town. 

THE BLUNTED AGE 

[The old man sips his broth and reads his paper before 
the fire. His daughters whisper at a window. One of them 
holds a letter.] 

First Daughter 

I dread his knowing. 

Second Daughter 

She was his favorite sister — 

Older than he, and very far away. 

Think of it — no one with her at the last! 

Better delay the telling . . . such a sorrow . . . 
First Daughter 

Ah, you remember how he loved our mother! 

And yet, last summer, after she had died 

He never seemed to take it hard at ail. 

He seemed too much resigned, too much himself. 

It would have killed him twenty years ago! 
Second Daughter 

It is the age they come to. Something goes out, 

Goes mercifully out. I often think 

They learn to take death as they take their broth. 

Their daily walk, their game of solitaire. 
First Daughter 

And you and I, sister? Already youth 

Slips far and far behind us. Shall we, too . . . ? 
Second Daughter [Tearfully] 

How can you say it? How can you say it? Oh! 
First Daughter 

Here comes old Nurse Lucretia up the street, 

Heavy with her dull robes, and hurrying 

To be the first to bear the word to him. 
Second Daughter 

Sign to her, wave her away, wave her away! 

He has seen her close so many dead eyes! 


Agnes Lee 

First Daughter No, 

She has passed along, she was not coming in.

Hush, he may hear!

Second Daughter 

Make some good reason, take the paper from him 

Before he reads • . . the names. Who knows but 
hers 

Might be already there? 
First Daughter It is too late. 

His finger finds the column. 
The Old Man [Calling] Here! See here! 

Why, Adelaide is dead! My sister Adelaide! 
Daughters 

O father, father! 
The Old Man I suppose it's true. 

First Daughter 

A letter came. Now read it, deary, read it. 
The Old Man 

No, let it wait. So Adelaide is dead! 

Well, she was restless — go and go she must. 

First to this place, then that place, till at last 

She settled in Nevada. As for me. 

Here I am still, and I shall count my hundred. 

Well, well, well, well, so Adelaide is dead!

FROM THE DAY-BOOK OF A FORGOTTEN 
PRINCE 

My father is happy or we should be poor. 
His gateway is wide, and the folk of the moor 
Come singing so gaily right up to the door. 

We live in a castle that's dingy and old; ' 
The casements are broken^ the corridors cold, 
The larder is empty, the cook is a scold. 

But father can dance, and his singing is loud. 
From meadow and highway there's always a crowd 
That gathers to hear him, and this makes him proud. 

He roars out a song in a voice that is sweet — 
Of grandeur that's gone, rare viands to eat, 
And treasure that used to be laid at his feet. 

He picks up his robe, faded, wrinkled and torn. 
Though banded in ermine, moth-eaten and worn. 
And held at the throat by a twisted old thorn. 

He leaps in the air with a rickety grace. 

And a kingly old smile illumines his face. 

While he fondles his beard and stares off into space. 

The villagers laugh, then look quickly away. 
And some of them kneel in the orchard to pray. 
I often hear whispers: "The old king is fey." 


Jean Starr Untermeyer 

But after they're gone, we shall find, if you please, 
White loaves and a pigeon, and honey and cheese. 
And wine that we drink while I sit on his knees. 

And, while he sups, he will feed me and tell 

Of Mother, whom men used to call "The Gazelle," 

And of glorious times before the curse fell. 

And then he will fall, half-asleep, to the floor; 
The rafters will echo his quivering snore. . . . 
I go to find cook through the slack oaken door. 

My father is happy or we should be poor. 
His gateway is wide^ and the folk of the moor 
Come singing so gaily right up to the door, 

Jean Starr Untermeyer 



A FILLET OF THORN 

Tell me, how can I sing 
Who have not tasted pain? — 

Who, having grieved an hour. 
Laugh and am glad again? 

It will take a* winter of frost. 
Aching and storm-filled years, 

Before I am lord of life. 
Before I am king of tears.

THE WAGES OF SIN 

God the Inscrutable 

Looked on complacently 

The while young Denison 

Slipped all his debts by careful insolvency, 

Broke his wife's heart, and ruined the serving girl. 

But Lobster Salad and Iced Watermelon — 

That was too much for even a godhead: 

"I'll smite him for that," quoth God the Inscrutable. 

And the wretch died in torment 

At two in the morning.

FOG 

The sea is a meadow, pale meadow of silence 
Where flowers are blooming, white flowers of sound. 
And deep in the petals, the pale listless petals. 
Lost ships fumble grumbling, with blindness half crazy. 

Does He muse, the Creator, as He peers in the vapor ?- 
"So bumble bees trouble the heart of the daisy." 

Kathryn White Ryan 




GEYSER 

Presto!— 

A crystal dancer 

Shimmers into the air, 

Waving veils of mist. 

Stricken, 

She quivers — 

Sinks — 

Falling upon herself, 

Dead.

GARGOYLE 

Your tongue hangs out, 

You gloat 

And shout. 

You leer a ribald sophistry 

At me. 

From where, 

Half goat. 

You stare 

And lean in horizontal glee.

DON JUAN IN PORTUGAL 

At every pelhourinho's ledge 
Faces to set my teeth on edge — 
Gray gossips, like a dusty hedge. 
Whisper and crackle. 

I lean at Alcobaca, dim 

Wth fig-leaves twisted round its rim. 

Pauses a slim 

Tall maid. Her name? — ^A Latin hymn, 

Gloria da Madre de Deus; 

A white-rose face dipped tremulous — 

A profile carved as nobly clear 

As love-child of Aurelius. 

White-clad, barefoot and straight she stood. 
Vase-bearing nymph ripe to be wooed 
In some delicious interlude. 

What need now to remember more? — 
The tiled and twisted fountain's pour. 
The vase forgotten on the floor, 
The white street ending in her door; 

Her head, a dark flower on a stem; 

Her diadem 

Of heavy hair, the Moorish low estalegem; 


Florence Wilkinson 

Outside, the stillness and white glare 
Of Alcobaca's noonday square; 
My hands that dare — 
The beauty of her loosened hair: 

White shift, white door, the white still street; 
Her lips, her arms, her throat, her feet; 
After a while — the bread and meat, 

A dewy jar of cool red wine, 
Olives that glisten wet with brine. 
White rose of Alcobaca — mine — 
We kiss again above the wine! 

The red wine drunk, the broken crust. 

We parted as all lovers must. 

Madre in gloriuy be* thou just 

To that frail glory — 

A white rose fallen into dust! 

Florence Wilkinson 


THE PASSERS-BY 

THE PARADE 

Faces, laughing and torch-lit, 

Passing and passing — 

Laughing and torch-lit and passing! 

Voices, crying and shouting, 

Dying and dying — 

Crying and shouting and dying! 

Drums, beating and thumping. 

Retreating, retreating — 

Beating and thumping, retreating! 

Gone! There remains but the heat 
Of the August night-wind • 
Blowing a leaf down the street. 

TO THE HILLS AROUND NORTHAMPTON 

Little New England hills. 

How tenderly 

You gather in this bit of world 

To comfort me. 

Encircling all I love 

As I would do 

Had arms the reach of heart! 

Small hills of blue, 


Dorothy Butts 

If, having grown to be 

More tall than you, 

I shall be forced to see 

The farther view. 

How shall I feel 

The solace of your rounded form against the sky, 

Unless I kneel? 

A VANITY 

It is a vanity to make 

The little waves on my small lake 

Speak from their "deep spring depths." 

What can they have to say. 

Blown down the winking bay 

The first half of the day. 

Blown back all afternoon? 

See — in the early moon. 

Wind-driven home, they leap 

And scramble on the shore — 

And sleep. 

AUDIENCE 

Of what account the leafing trees — 

Dead leaves in autumn? What were these. 

Were there no poet's heart to please? 

Of you and me what can be said. 
Who are not, are, and then are dead — 
Without a poet overhead? 

[8i] 




 

LISTENING 

Into the night I sent my call 
For you, and hung my head 
When there was no reply. 

Tonight the singing sky 

Is calling me instead — 

Cry upon ringing cry. 

Although I do not hear your voice. 

My head is high. 



MAY BASKET 

I love you, dear; 
And all the little world 
Loves my simplicity. 

For in my love 

There are no passions whirled 

In wild complexity. 

No mystery 

Of "Docs she love?" and "Whom?' 

Needs fathoming. 

I gather love, 

And ever find more room 

For gathering. 


Dorothy Butts 

Will you take this basketful today, 
Of old love and new flowerets, and say, 
"This much she loved me during May?" 

THE TRANSIENT 

Dear, take my love and do not hesitate. 
You think that I shall always wait, 
I am so calm. 

(It is to reassure, and to inspire 
' New confidence in you.) 
Quick, take my love before it is too late! 

Here are my hands held out to give to you 

Their treasures — some old, some new. 

All dear to me. 

Oh, do not agonize me by delay. 

And musing which to take! 

Quick! — ^say I gave them to you, passing through. 

DIFFERENCE 

If you will wander, so shall I — 

In opposite directions ply 

Our irresistible two ways 

Into the nights, into the days. 

The east and west shall draw apart, 

Like magnets, your heart from my heart. 

• How vain our tears now we have sttn 
That east and west have common lures. 
You were my magnet — I was yours, 
With all the world between. 

PLEASE 

Give me the old familiar things, 

Though they be very plain: 

The quaint old tune Joanna sings. 

The small house in a lane, 

Whose fragrance meets the open door; 

The faded carpet on the floor, 

The patient peace of furniture — 

Familiar things I can endure. 

I have been brave a long, long while. 

Heard praise, and scorning afterward; 

I have met eyes that did not smile, 

And now I ask for my reward. 

I know the panoramic strand 

Of happiness, and grief's sequence. 

Rough grains have scratched my venturous hand. 

I beg no tribute nor defence; 

I only ask familiar things — 

The quaint old tune Joanna sings. 

Dorothy Butts 




POEMS 

GARGOYLES OF NOTRE DAME 

I watch them shuttle and weave and run 

Like dust before a scolding wind: 

Boats on the water, 

Leaves on the bank. 

And men on the streets and square. 

Leaves and snow and leaves again, 

And men. 

Boats to the sea, 

Leaves to the wind, 

Men to gibbet and wheel — • 

To thrones. 

To bed, 

To P^re Lachaise. 

Muddy tracks in the snow, 

And blood on the wheel. 

And rotting leaves on the tiles — 

The wind and rain will sweep them away 

As a soft curled plume might sweep 

Flecks from a silken gown. 

Shuttle and weave and run — 

Boats to the sea. 

Leaves to the wind 

And men to P^re Lachaise. 

EDGES 

Edges are more beautiful than anything — 

Edges 

Where the quiet deep shallows into loveliness, 

Where the clouds feather to wavering silver, 

And color kisses its brighter self. 

Life is most whitely light 

Where its low edge 

Melts in the still pool of death, 

As the sky-rim sinks 

In a moon-filled sea. 

LULLABY 

Tears for your pink, curled hands — 
They must strain to hold 
The smoke-thin garments of a dream. 

Tears for your still eyes — 
They must be pierced 
By the keen blades of beauty. 

Tears for your flower feet — 
They must bloom like first spring 
On wintry plains. 

Tears, tears for your eyes. 
And pink, curled hands. 
And blossom feet — tears! 


Henry Bellamann 

PEARS 

Quiet faces. 

That look in faith 

On distance, 

I will come to you 

And gaze upon that peace. 

I cannot tell 
If it be wind you see 
Across the summer grain, 
Or the shaken agony 
Of driven seas. 

GOD 

I often spend week-ends in heaven, 

And so I know him well. 

Most times he is too busy thinking things 

To talk; 

But then, I like his still aloofness 

And superior ease. 

I can't imagine him in armor, or in uniform. 

Or blowing like a windy Caesar 

Across the fields of Europe, 

Or snooping in my mind 

To find what I am thinking, 

Or being jealous of the darling idols 

I have made. 

If ever that slim word — aristocrat — 

Belonged to anyone, it is to God. 
You should see him steadying the wings 
Of great thoughts starting out 
On flight- 
Very like a scientist trying a machine. 
Patrician, cool, in a colored coat 
Rather like a mandarin's; 
Silver sandals — quite a picture! 
I can't see him 
Fluttering in wrathful haste, 
Or dancing like a fool. 

I don't go there often — 

Only when I'm at my best. 

I save up things: 

Pictures of the sea wild with white foam, 

Stories of engines beating through the clouds, 

News of earth in storm and sun. 

Some new songs — the best. 

He's fond of being entertained 

With what I choose to tell him of myself— 

Very kind about tomorrow, 

Indifferent of yesterday. 

He's like that— 

God in his heaven — alone. 

I know, for I made him, put him there 

Myself. 


Henry Bellamann 



THE ARTIST 



What would you do — 

If you had ear and brain attuned superbly 

To all the iridescent humming-birds of faint 

And delicate overtones 

That play like spirit flames 

Above the music? 

Suppose your eyes could see 

What mine see when a little wind passes, 

And all the garden is suddenly barred and starred 

With flying color. 

Suppose the tilting planes of dogwood bloom. 

In the green spring mist of young leaves. 

Caught your breath as though a hand 

Held your throat — 

Or that the red haw veiling herself in May 

Kept you awake at nights 

Remembering her bridal look. 

Oh, suppose this world of nuances. 

Opal-soft and frail and swift. 

Were for you a reality more hard 

Than things you call reality. 

And you lived always among the deaf and blind — 

What would you do? 

Henry Bellamann 


COMMENT 

FROM QUEEN ANNE TO GEORGE THE FIFTH 

THE death of Austin Dobson early in September com- 
pelled us all to turn and count the milestones. Was it 
possible that he had lived till yesterday — this artist in 
triolets — lived to bridge over, with his trim little silver- 
silken foot-path, the depth on depth and height on height 
of wild and thunder-echoing change which lie between his 
time, his mood, and ours? Was it possible that a poet 
who reached backward even from Victoria to light his 
little candle at the wax taper of Queen Anne, that such 
an one could have lived through impressionists and 
futurists, through fin-Je-sihcle lassitude and Celtic revolt, 
through imagists, vers-libristes, aeroplanes, submarines, 
Russian revolutions and the world war — lived unper- 
turbed in his eighteenth-century garden, a loyal citizen of 
an extinct world! 

However, in the seventies and eighties Austin Dobson 
was a "new movement." Swinburne had been showing 
what might be done with English rhythmics; now Dob- 
son, only three years younger, would open a fresh chapter 
by following the footsteps of Th6odore de Banville in 
adapting to modern uses the old French forms of those 
fifteenth-century rhymers Marot and Villon. His art was 
of a neatness, a nicety; and all the circumstances of his 
life encouraged and developed its precision, its good- 
mannerly grace. A comfortable little government office, 


From ^ueen Anne to George the Fifth 

with three-fourths of his salary continuing on retirement 
at sixty; a comfortable pension of two hundred and fifty 
pounds for his services to literature; a comfortable home 
and family and "troops of friends"; and a comfortable 
by-gone period to retire into out of this troublesome 
modern world. Too comfortable perhaps — apparently a 
bit enervating; for his books of verse and prose all ante- 
date his retirement from office at the turn of the century. 
Through the last twenty eventful years this poet has had 
little to say. 

A master-miniaturist? — perhaps not quite, because his 
eighteenth-century portraits, ballads, dialogues are 
scarcely the real thing after all, any more than the "period 
rooms" which our master-decorators create today. They 
were done with zest, but not with the eighteenth-century 
faith — their fragile artificiality lacks the true DuBarry 
bloom. A master of vers de societef — possibly again not 
quite, because the master, even in that genre, always 
makes you believe, or at least suspect, that he is really, 
in love, or in joy, or in grief, in some wistful corner of his 
gay but battered heart; whereas Dobson merely plays 
with pretended emotions— he is always frankly in cos- 
tume. And as is the way with masqiieraders, he usually 
makes too many bows and gestures, he slightly over-acts 
the role. 

The poems in French forms also— the ballades, villa- 
nelles, rondeaux, though done with superlative deftness, 
remain literary exercises. 




 

Always in costume, did I say? Before Sedan is a poem 
of simplicity and sincerity, with no superfluous words to 
mar the sad little story. And in this briefer poem. The 
Cradle y there is a quietly restrained feeling: 

How steadfastly she'd worked at it! 

How bvingly had dressed 
With all her would-be-mother's wit 

That little rosy nest! 

How longingly she'd hung on it! — 

It sometimes seemed, she said. 
There lay beneath its coverlet 

A little sleeping head. 

He came at last, the tiny guest. 

Ere bleak December fled; 
That rosy nest he never pressed — 

Her coflin was his bed. 

In the best of the gayer poems also one may find a 
hint of feeling, a kind of artistic sincerity, as in an idyl by 
Boucher or Fragonard; that is, behind the shepherdess 
symbol is a certain wistfulness of dream. We all remem- 
ber The Ladies of St. James — here is the first of its seven 

stanzas: 

The ladies of St. James's 

Go swinging to the play; 
Their footmen run before them, 

With a " Stand by! Clear the way! " 
But Phyllida, my Phyllidal 

She takes her buckled shoon. 
When we go out a-courting 

Beneath the harvest moon. 

This poem seems to me Dobson's high-water mark — I 


From ^een Anne to George the Fifth 

cannot find any other in his two volumes of quite so fine a 
quality. The Ballad of Beau Brocade^ Une Marquise^ and 
some of the Proverbs in Porcelain^ are as lightly touched 
off, but their artificiality is less skilfully disguised. 

It is interesting to note how many of the muse's gayer 
fashions of the last half-century were set by Dobson. 
First, the old French forms, which soon became a fever, a 
mania, until every magazine poet in two continents was 
writing rondels and villanelles — a trick easily learned, and 
tiresome unless turned oflF with the rarest grace. Then 
the library fashion of bookish poems, including the 
Horation fashion of light-winged tributes, imitations or 
free translations in the manner of the Augustan bard — 
fashions so eflFectively followed in Chicago by Eugene 
Field and B. L. T. of happy memory, and still pursued, 
often afar oflF, by every "colyumist" in the land. Indeed, 
most of the journalist-poets would confess that they had 
gone to school to Dobson, and that on the whole the 
discipline had been salutary. 

The name of another venerable English poet leaps to 
one's mind by way of contrast — a poet also born in 1840, 
and now still sturdy in his eighty-second year. Thomas 
Hardy's mind, from youth to age, has looked forward, 
never back. He lit his torch at truth's camp-fire, and he 
has carried it ablaze toward the new age — no abyss or 
peak of change could find him unready or afraid. 

Hardy, in his youth a man of our time or beyond; 
Dobson, in his old age a contemporary of Pope and Gay — 

was there ever a sharper sting of difFerence? The difFer- 

ence between a great soul and a little one, between a seer 

and an entertainer. However, each in his own way has 

been true to his vision. One may grant to each the 

epitaph Dobson begged for himself— 

Saying, "He held his pen in trust 
To Art, not serving shame or lust." 

But one must grant to Hardy also some more heroic 
line. H. M. 

REVIEWS 

DRINKWATER AS POET AND PLAYWRIGHT 

Pawns (four one-act plays), by John Drink water. Hough- 
ton Mifflin Co. 
Mary Stuart ^ by John Drink water. Houghton Mifflin Co. 
PoemSy by John Drinkwater. Houghton Mifflin Co. 

Does Mr. Drinkwater, poet, use his prose material for 
his plays? Is it not the duty of a poet to continue being a 
poet in the theatre? Mr. Drinkwater should suspend 
business temporarily, take an inventory, and separate his 
art material from his merchandise. Strong speeches, 
prompted by fearless thinking, project themselves through 
the mass of his work, but they are in great danger of being 
engulfed in heavy waves of conventional mediocrity. 
Indeed, the proportion of poor stuff is so great that one 
becomes prejudiced against the whole unless one reads 
carefully. 


Drinkwater as Poet and Playwright 

In PawnSy a volume of one-act plays, The Storm de- 
mands some consideration because of its theme and a 
small section of its dialogue. It is reminiscent of Synge's 
Riders to the Sea^ and of course it suffers by comparison. 
However, in this bit of the opening dialogue he has caught 
the quality and rhythm of the Irishman, and it leads one 
to believe that Mr. Drinkwater could write if he would 
orientate himself: 

/iiice, I have prayed these hours, and now I'm tired of it. 
He is caught in some grip of the rock, and crying out, 
And crying, and crying; and none can hear him cry 
Because of this great beastliness of noise. 

Sarah. Past crying now, I think. 

Joan, There, take no heed 

Of what she says — it's a rusty mind she has. 
Being old, and wizened with bad luck on the hills. 

But he fails to sustain this simplicity of speech and the 

atmosphere of the storm, or to develop the tragic theme 

with power. The speeches drag out archaically. The 

Stranger, one of the characters, states: 

I was a dream, 
A cold monotony suddenly thrust 
Into a waking world of lusty change, 
A wizened death elected from the waste 
To strive and mate with eager lords of tumult. 
Beauty was winged about me, darkling speed 
Took pressure of earth and smote against my face; 
I. rode upon the front of heroic hours. 

And through the remainder of the volume Mr. Drink- 
water does not attempt to pull himself out of archaism. 
In the other plays he adds rhyme, which doesn't help any. 

The title The God of ^iet sounds like Lord Dunsany, 
and it is possible that Lord Dunsany might have dis- 
guised the triteness of the theme. The theme — the return 
to quiet, to peace after war, the futility of war, the 
ineffectual result of fighting, the planting of revenge 
which instigates the eternal round of war, peace, war — 
must antagonize the artist. Weak propaganda for peace is 
a just cause for inciting belligerency, and this play is full 
of it. 

Old Beggar. It is the quiet mind that keeps 

The tumults of the world in poise. 
Soldier. It is the angry soul that sleeps 

Where the world's folly is and noise; 
King. For anger blunts us and destroys. 
Citiun. We are litde men to be so proud. 
Young Beggar^ We are fools: what was so long to build 

We break. 

With the padding and piling of long speeches on the 
same theme, one feels that Mr. Drinkwater should have 
followed the trail of his King: 

You god of quiet, some day shall men have spent 
All the wild humorous blood of argument. 

A Nighi of the Trojan War is a tragic episode and a good 
theme, but one is reminded of a better handling of it by 
Henri Barbusse in one of his short stories. Cophetuay the 
last play in the volume, must have been written in the 
author's salad days. 

If one may continue to suggest other authors for the 
handling of Mr. Drinkwater's ideas, James Joyce would 


Drinkwater as Poet and Playwright 

be a good bet to develop the theme in Mary Stuart. Not 
that Mr. Drinkwater is incapable of handling it — the 
following speeches lead one to believe in him. If such 
speeches could grip him and control him to the end of a 
play, we should have something to reckon with: 

Mary, My love is crazed, a turbulence, without direction. It was 
made to move in long deep assonance. I who should be love, may 
but bum and bum with the love that I am not. 

Mary. Daraley, Riccio, Bothwell — there's a theme for a great heart to 
play! And there's so much to do. I have talent — as rare as any in 
Europe. It should be my broad road— that and my love. And I 
cannot use it, for my love is beaten up like dust, blin(ting me. To be 
troubled always in desires — that's to be cursed, not wanton. Little 
frustradons — and it should be the wide and ample movement of life. 

Certain speeches have the depth and sweep of drama, 
they have the flesh and blood of drama; but they should 
be incorporated in another play. 

The prologue is in modern dialogue, but without distinc- 
tion; and it does not insinuate itself into the "dream." 
The dream is lugged in on a dray. It fails to win you 
with its spell because there is no magic. The modern 
characters in the prologue argue a theme old in point 
of time, but modern because it has yet to be developed 
and established. As if afraid of its modernity, these 
characters thrust it back into an old story with conven- 
tional manners, dialogue, and wit. Whereas the vitality 
of the theme could break old molds, and precipitate itself 
without apology into a great, free, modern expression. 

The play ends with the voices coming back out of the 

[973 




 

"dream." This is handled effectively, it has the glamour 
of hallucination; but Mary's spirit's answer to Hunter's 
real question breaks the spell. It would be more dramatic 
and in better taste to let the play end with Hunter's 
"My God! — What's that?'' and leave Mary's answer to 
the imagination of the audience. 

We seem to be passing through the phase of "sightless 
thought" in the theatre — the gathering of material from 
history, from industrial, psychological or sociological 
problems, and making copybook sketches of life instead 
of evoking the unseen through the magic of art. Because 
the art-theatres are endeavoring to reserve the theatre for 
works of the imagination, they are branded high-brow. 
As a matter of truth, the recorders of facts, the chroniclers 
of the literal, are the high-brows, the remote ones. As 
Mr, Drinkwater says in his poem History y feeling, beauty, 
fancy — 

Such are the things remain 

Quietly and forever in the brain, 

And the things that they choose for history-making pass. 

The book of poems opens with Reciprocity y which com- 
mends itself to the reader's good-nature. It is pleasing, 
and springs from feeling. The poem History beckons 
with so pleasant a smile, and is really so charming, that 
one trips gaily over the trite poems which follow, until 
one receives a nasty bump in Reverie. After reading — 

And only beautiful can be 
Because of beauty is in me — 


Drinkwater as Poet and Playwright 

it is hard to press on. But if one is to be a critic one must 
have the unflinching endurance of M, Jules Lemaitre — 
"What if I were perchance doing my part in killing a 
masterpiece!" 

The book of poems has many pages. We have a large 
group in the folk-song manner, two sonnets (we swing 
into their familiar melody with indifference), a group of 
love-poems tempered with pastoral coolness — songs fash- 
ioned circumspectly without unchaperoned passions. 

The long poem, The Fires of God^ goes the way of too 
many long poems — limping, strutting and striding. 
Seven-league boots would compass the same journey in a 
few powerful steps. However, the ambling in Travel Talk 
is pleasant and restful, as ambling in relaxed moods 
always is. And The Carver in Stone^ another too long 
poem, has beauty and an insinuating subtlety in its 
development. The Building is full of nice suggestions, and 
significant repetitions which give heft to its balance and 
harmony. 

Mr. Drinkwater, in both his plays and his poems, has 
many moments of clear thinking, but when he summons 
his naked truth and meets it face to face one feels that he 
is inadequate. However, some of his thought digs so 
deep, and has such power that one hopes sincerely that 
his prayer will be answered — 

Give us to build, above the deep intent, 
The deed.

OF DREAMS AND STITCHES 

Curtains^ by Hazel Hall. John Lane Co. 

Comes Hazel Hall with her little book, every word and 
emotion of which is poignantly authentic. The usual first 
book of verse is conglomerate, and leaves its reader with 
the confused sense of having listened outside the tower of 
Babel. But this is the crystallization of a personality — 
one emerges from it as though one had sat opposite the 
woman sewing in her little room, plying her needle or 
stopping to thread it, and talking in a voice at once sad 
and indomitable. 

Her judgment of the world is keen and impartial. She 
knows it by its footfalls. The step tells more than the 
chiselled expressionless face: 

They pass so close, the people on the street! 
Philosophy comes in through the open window. Inevi- 
tably, 

Only one sound drifts up to me, 
The blend of every tread in one. 
Impersonal as the beat of the sea. 

Often the poet's strength suggests itself even more in 
rhythm than in word, as in the three lines quoted above, 
and again: 

The beat of life is wearing me 

To an incomplete oblivion, 

Yet not to the certain dignity 

Of death. 

In CurtainSy which is Part I of the little book, a certain 
wistfulness pervades, something compounded half of sad- 

[lOO] 



 



Of Dreams and Stitches 

ness and half of hope. She is never bitter — even from 

DefeiU she wrenches power: 

Time's soft fingers gently close 
Over my outstretched hand, and in 
Their certain touch I feel repose. 

In Part II: Needlework her touch is even surer, even 
more deft. I know nothing more definitely and delicately 
of woman than this handful of pages. 

Every poem in the little volume is quotable. We have 
selected The Long Day, one of the less familiar, for beauty 
of form as well as for its representativeness: 

I am sewing out my sorrow, 

Like a thread, wearing it thin; 
It will be old and frayed tomorrow. 

NeeJU, turn out; medUy turn in. 

Sorrow's thread is a long thread. 

Needle^ one stitch; needle^ two. 
And sorrow's thread is a strong thread, 

But I will wear it through. 

Then not only will sorrow 

Be old and thin and frayed; 
But I shall have tomorrow 

Something sorrow has made. 

There is something in these poems as personal as the 
warm and vibrantly sympathetic touch of a hand. The 
poet has given of herself with generosity, and she leaves 
one with the sense of being near and intimate. More as a 
confidant than as some strange reader, one listens with 
wonder to her fragile fancies, so musically given forth, and

CORRESPONDENCE 

POET AND COMPOSER AS ALLIES 

Hear Miss Monroe: As a writer of both music and verse, 
your discussion of Poetry and the Allied Arts in the October 
issue of your magazine has an especial interest for me. 

You quote Mr. Case as to the difficulty of arranging a 
program of American songs fk)ssessing sufficient variety of 
mood and treatment. I believe one reason for this, in the 
case of the individual composer, is that a publisher be- 
comes accustomed to a certain style from a certain musi- 
cian, and when the musician changes his idiom the pub- 
lisher waggles a disapproving head. It is difficult to 
break away from old patterns and be received as the 
weaver of new, and often one's best work is a long time 
finding itself in print. 

One of the reasons operating against poet and musician 
combining more freely is the scant recognition, even 
obliteration, often accorded the poet-member of the 
partnership. I am moved to a comment not pleasant to 
make, concerning as it does my own kinsmen. Obser- 
vation has forced the conclusion that many musicians are 
a somewhat insular folk; or should one say indifferent? 
Surely not ignorant — at any rate, something that begins 
with I. They are apt to have a kind of unilateral art- 
sense, a squint-view, as it were, at creative expression, a 
proneness to feel not only that music's the thing, but the 
whole thing. It is a not uncommon experience to see the 


Poet and Composer as Allies 

text of a long work printed in a program headed by the 
name of the artist who has set it to music, the poet's name 
appearing not at all. Time and again song-poems are 
anonymously printed, singly and in groups, in the original 
or in translation; and the reader is left to infer — if he 
give it a thought — that the words had " jes' growed." 
There is small douht that the verse yoked to music is 
often, one may say usually, of negligible inspiration; but 
if it be given the dignity of program-printing, certainly 
the authorship should be acknowledged. I look forward 
to the time when the poet in his association with music 
will be considered worthy of his hire, be that hire nothing 
more than recognition of authorship; to the time when all 
programs shall print, between the title of a song and the 
name of its composer, the bracketed name of the poet; and 
when all music critics, not merely the distinguished few, 
know something of the fellow-arts as well as of music. 

Music-publishers have done much to accent the value 
of the text by giving it separate printing in song publica- 
tions. William Arms Fisher, a composer of songs and the 
editor of an eastern music house, takes the broad view that 
in a song the words are of chief import. 

The creative publisher of sweeping vision and the will to 
dramatize those visions, can do much toward bringing to- 
gether poet and musician and all allied artists.^ My 
coUabor'atioh with Hdnry Hadley in the writing of an 
oratorio, Resurgdm^ to which y6u referred, was originally 
due to thfc initiative of Mr. Fisher. He' asked me for the 

text for a cantata, and, following his usual method of pre- 
senting his wishes infectiously and with a large measure of 
faith, launched the undertaking almost coincidentally 
with the reading of the letter. When the text was finished 
he invited Mr. Hadley to make the music. Thus was a 
happy unity established: music, poetry, opportunity — for 
certainly the editor or publisher stands for opportunity. 
After the production of the cantata and one other piece, 
Mr. Hadley wrote proposing that we do an oratorio to- 
gether. He said he had ''always wished to express in 
music the sombre passing of mortal life and the glory of 
immortality."' Upon completion of the text I urged him 
to make suggestions, and while he was at work on the third 
section he asked for the interpolation of a contrasting 
mood. Certainly the text was improved by the suggested 
addition. I was kept in touch with the music from time 
to time, being told for what voices in solo, chorus, etc., 
the various parts of the poem were scored. 

There is no question in my mind that co-labor between 
artists increases the joy which should be the well-spring, 
and not a by-product, of art-creation. 

Louise Ayres Gamett 

REACTIONARY COMPOSERS 

Dear Editor: It has occurred to me many times, and 
with even greater force since reading your Comment in 
October's Poetry, that the present unalliance in America 


Reactionary Composers 

between modern poetry and modern music is primarily 
due to the complacency of the reactionaries of the musical 
world. By this I mean not only the reactionaries among 
the composers and critics, but those in the audiences 
themselves, who insist, consciously or unconsciously, 
that our operatic, song and orchestral compositions 
should remain more than a little antiquated, scented 
with lavender, while the contemporary arts are keeping 
pace with the complexities of civilization. 

I am aware that the thought which must be uppermost 
in the convictions of the conservative-minded person is 
that a torrent has swept into modern art, literature, 
poetry, sculpture, and even into the drama; something 
a little ribald, lacking in dignity and beauty as he has 
known it. And it is perfectly proper, doubtless, for 
those who are so inclined to hold back a bit before plung- 
ing into the swirl of this new movement. There is, 
of course, always the possibility that each apparent step 
forward is in reality merely a mood which has taken 
possession of the reasoning faculties among the free 
spirits of the generation, and which will prove in time 
to be just a slight stumble, possibly in the right direction, 
occurring before the next legitimate step of progress is 
finally achieved. 

On the other hand, it is* quite as true that unless there 
is a tendency in the arts to reflect the spirit of the age — 
unless they are vividly interpretive, it is evident that 
they are without constructive value. 

From this hypothesis let X equal progress plus logical 
development, and behold we have those who would solve 
the problem! Sherwood Anderson is the forerunner of 
one group, Amy Lowell of another; then there are the 
followers of Picasso and Brancusi, of Maurice Browne, 
and countless others. Whether or not they gain a foot- 
hold is as much our concern as theirs, for they are our- 
selves, our explanation, the story which the future 
generations shall read of us. And meanwhile music 
stands like a Boston bas-bleu, her skirt a little shortened 
because of the influence of Korsakov and Dvorak, but 
still wearing her New England rubbers. 

This, perhaps, is the explanation of the answer I have 
so often received in talking with American song-writers. 
I have asked them why they do not set such and such a 
poem to music, and the inevitable answer is given to me: 
"It isn't adaptable." Adaptable to what? Certainly 
not adaptable to the music of fifty or twenty-five years 
ago; no, even not adaptable to the song-music that we 
loved last year. It must be something so splendidly 
new that modern music will be able to touch the out- 
stretched hand of modern poetry. Kay Boyle 

Note by the editor: A word of encouragement comes to us from an 
enthusiast who has worked for years toward a closer alliance between 
American poetry and music — Eleanor' Everest Freer, a Chicago com- 
poser who has used effectively many fine modern poems as the text for 
songs. Mrs. Freer has urged especially that operas and concert numbers 
should be sung in the English language and has inaugurated the Opera- 
in-our-language Foundation to that end.

ANNOUNCEMENT OF AWARDS 

For the ninth time the editors and advisory committee 
of Poetry face the agreeable but difficult duty of awarding 
our annual prizes. Nine years ago prizes in this art were 
practically unheard-of in America, although many annual 
prizes and scholarships in painting, sculpture, architecture 
and music had been liberally endowed in perpetuity — 
awards now ranging in value from one hundred dollars to 
two thousand or more, even to the richest of all, the three- 
year scholarship of the American Academy in Rome, 
which carries studio, board and lodging, and a liberal 
income. 

From the beginning we have believed in such awards, 
as both a stimulus to artists and a kind of advertisement 
to the public; and have argued that they are as well 
deserved, and as effective for these purposes, in poetry as 
in the other arts. We rejoice that the tide is beginning to 
turn, and hope that it may prove strong and high. The 
DiaFs announcement of an annual purse of two thousand 
dollars to be given to some one of its contributors is not 
aimed at poets exclusively, but poets at least have a 
chance at it; and the five hundred dollars, with which the 
Poetry Society of America has of late annually crowned 
some book of American verse, has an air of permanency 
although not yet permanently endowed. 

In his letter Concerning Awards in our September 
number, Mr. Aldis asked the following question, which 

the editor promised to answer, or at least discuss, in 
November: 

Could you devise and suggest some plan by which prizes would not 
be awarded for an individual poem, but based on broader considerations 
of personal production and tsJent, youth and need? 

In reply we would suggest that magazine editors and 
other publishers of verse are usually so well informed as 
to the "talent, youth and need" of their younger contrib- 
utors that they would have no difficulty in awarding on 
that basis as many scholarships or "encouragement 
prizes" as they might be entrusted with. Every year 
Poetry has observed this rule in awarding its young 
poet's prize, always wishing it had eight or ten such 
prizes, instead of one, wherewith to aid a little with honor 
and money a few young poets on their stern and rock- 
bound path. 

The difficulty is not here — it lies not in making the 
award, but in getting the money for it. And patrons of 
the arts are not wholly to blame for omitting poets from 
such annual endowments, because this art has as yet few 
permanent institutions to which people of wealth might 
give or bequeath such a fund in trust. The Poetry Society 
of America would accept such a trust with joy, but it is 
too strongly localized in New York, and too academic in 
its present tendencies, to inspire strong hope of its exercis- 
ing a progressive influence. Still less confidence could be 
felt in the National Institute of Arts and Letters, or its 
sacred inner circle the Academy, whose leadership is so 

[io8] 



 



Announcement of Awards 

hopelessly old-fashioned that it has not yet recognized the 
fellowship of women in the modern arts. 

Poetry of course would rejoice to become the dispenser 
or initiator of such a fund, and would engage to satisfy 
any possible donor as to its disposition both during and 
after the continuance of the magazine. Some trust 
company of repute should be custodian, the interest to be 
paid annually by direction of the committee of award. 
In choosing this committee, the first rule should be that 
none but poets, poets of recognized standing and au- 
thority, should be eligible; and, second, this committee of 
poets should be instructed that the original and experi- 
mental work is to be honored rather than the conservative 
and assured. 

The first committee of award might be chosen by the 
editor and donor, aided by such expert advice as they 
might call in. This committee — say of three, or possibly 
five poet-members, to be chosen from widely separated 
localities — should be self-perpetuating, but under a time 
restriction: that is, every three or five years one member 
should drop out on the election of a new one. 

Such a committee of award would not derive from 
Poetry, and the possible discontinuance of the magazine 
would not interrupt it in the least. However, if the donor 
should happen to like Poetry and wish to endorse its 
policy, its editor might become ex officio a member of the 
committee. 

Another method of selecting a committee of award was 

suggested by a lawyer of my acquaintance. Let the 
presidents of three widely separated institutions — say, the 
Universities of California and Illinois, and the Poetry 
Society of America; or Harvard, the University of Chicago, 
and the Poetry Society of South Carolina; or any other 
representative three — ^let such a group of colleges or 
societies be requested each year by the custodian of the 
fund (the trust company) to appoint each a member of 
the committee of awards, such committee-member to be a 
poet of high repute, one not a member of their faculty or 
board of officers. And let this committee bestow the 
award. 

Either of these methods would seem to promise as much 
progressiveness and fluidity, and freedom from local 
prejudice, as any artistic endowment in perpetuity can be. 
It would be for the donor to decide whether his gift or 
bequest should be used for scholarships — that is, student 
awards to young poets; or for awards of honor, so to speak, 
to poets who have done high service in the art. If the 
award should be generously large, the honor would become 
correspondingly conspicuous, and this fact would be a 
strong influence toward the worthy disposal of it, as in 
the case of the Nobel Prize. 

We strongly hope that some man or woman of sufficient 
wealth may be moved to follow this suggestion — someone 
who would like to turn out of the beaten paths with his 
gift or bequest, and do something original and construc- 
tive and inspiring.

Announcement of Awards 

^ With this rather long preliminary, we now proceed to 
award Poetry's three prizes for poems printed in its pages 
during its ninth year—October 1920 to September 1921. 
As usual, poems by members of the jury are withdrawn 
from competition — in this case That YeoTy by Marion 
Strobel, a group of seven poems in the February number; 
and Eunice Tietjens' translations, from the French of 
Antonin Proust, of Modem Greek Popular «S*o«j^j, printed in 
November of last year. Indeed, no translations are con- 
sidered for prizes. 

We are enabled once more, through the liberality of 
Mrs. Edgar Speyer, of New York, to award the "yo\ing 
poet's prize," which for the past four years has been 
given, "as a mark of distinction and encouragement, to 
the young poet, comparatively unknown as yet, who, in 
the opinion of the jury, most deserves and needs the 
stimulus of such an award." 

Hoping that our contributors and readers will grant to 
the members of the jury honesty of judgment, and will not 
demand infallibility, we now announce the awards: 

The Helen Haire Levinson Prize of two hundred 
dollars, for a poem or group of poems by a citizen of the 
United States, is awarded to 

Lew Sarett 

of Evanston, Illinois, for his poem. The Box of Gody pub- 
lished in the April number. 
This prize was founded in 1913 by Mr. Salmon O.

work by a young poet, is awarded to 

Hazel Hall 

of Portland, Oregon, for her group of seven poems, 
Repetitions^ published in the May number. 

Six other special prizes, usually of one hundred dollars 
each, have been previously awarded: to Louise DriscoU, 
for Metal CheckSy as the best poem of the war received in 
competition and printed in our War Number of Novem- 
ber, 1914; to Wallace Stevens, for Three Travellers Watch 
a SunrisCy adjudged the best one-act poetic play received

1916 — Muna Lee, for Foot-notes— III ^ IV^ VII. 

1918 — Emanuel Carnevali, for The Splendid Common- 
place. 

1919 — Mark TurbyfiU, for poems of 1917-18-19.

Cape HelleSy by Morris Gilbert (June). 
rVithout Sleepy and The Poet at Nightfally by Glenway

(The editor regrets that the extreme length of the 
poems by Mr. Sarett and Mr. HuefFer makes it impossible 
for us to reprint the prize poems of this year. We must 
refer our readers to our April, March and May numbers.) 


OUR CONTEMPORARIES 

A NEW "youth" 

We welcome the advent of a new monthly — Youth: A 
Magazine of the Arts — and wish it high inspiration and 
long life. The editors are H. C. Auer, Jr., and Sam 
Putnam, the business manager is Henry Drews, and the 
place of publication is 70 East Elm Street, Chicago. The 
first number, October, which appears as we go to press, 
contains prose and verse by Ben Hecht, Elsa Gidlow, 
Emanuel Carnevali, John McClure, Pierre Loving, Henry 
Bellamann, Jun Fujita, Oscar Williams and others; and 
pictures by Wallace Smith, Steen Hinrichsen and Fred- 
erick Dalrymple. The list of contributors, present and 
future, looks promising, and the size and format are con- 
venient and in good taste. 

NOTES 

Mr. Edwin Curran, who is a telegrapher in Zanesville, Ohio, has 
published privately two small books of verse, Fhrst Poems and Second 
Poems^ since his first appearance in Poetry in March, 191 8. In spite 
of their modest backing and poor typography, these have attracted a 
good deal of notice from critics of authority. 

Agnes Lee (Mrs. Otto Freer), of Chicago, is the author of several 
books of verse, the latest being The Sharing (Sherman, French & Q).) 

Jean Starr Untermeyer, (Mrs. Louis U.), is the author of Growing 
Pains y published in 191 8 by B. W. Huebsch; and a new book of later 
poems will soon appear. 

Florence Wilkinson (Mrs. Wilfred Muir Evans), of New York, is 
the author of The Ride Home (Houghton Mifflin G).), and of a number 
of novels ai^d plays. 

[ns] 




 

Mr. Henry Bellamann, who is at the head of a music school in G>lum- 
bia, S. C, has written verse and prose for the special magazines and 
music journals. His first book of verse, A Music-Teacher* s Note-hook^ 
was issued in 1910 by the Lyric Society. 

Miss Kate Buss, of New York, is the author ofjevom Block (McGrath- 
Sherrill Press, Boston). 

Mr. John R. C. Peyton is a young poet of Chicago. 

The other poets of this number are new to our readers. 

Miss Dorothy Butts, a native of San Francisco, but now resident in 
New York, graduated last June from Smith G)llege. 

Kathryn White Ryan (Mrs. Edward Ryan), went to New York from 
Denver two years ago, and has since published a few poems and prose 
sketches in some of the magazines. 

Miss Jessica North, who is the private secretary of President Judson 
of the University of Chicago, has also published poems in magazines. 

Miss Anita Grannis, of New York, divides her time "between the 
University of New York and Richmond Hill House, an East Side settle- 
ment in the congested Italian colony."

The Greatest Poet of ^ * "» 
¥ ^ "^ Contemporary Europe 

is the judgment of the French critic, Eugene Clement, 
regarding Kostes Palamas. As the latter has written 
only in the modern Greek, his work has been slow to 
reach English readers; but since the publication of "Life 
Immovable" in 1919 and of "A Hundred Voices" last 
springy the majority of critics in America and England 
have endorsed the high praise accorded the poems on 
the Continent. The translator, Dr. A. E. Phoutrides, 
has provided critical and biographical introductions 
which do much to increase the reader's appreciation. 
Although the two volumes form a continuous whole, 
their virtual independence is indicated by difference in 
binding and typography. The price of "Life Immov- 
able" is Ja.oo; of "A Hundred Voices," )2.5o. 

'*This voliime [Life Immovable] is doubtless the best English version of a 
modern Greek poet and will prove of surprising interest." — Classical 
Journal, 

"Palamas is a true artist with an eye for all the beauties of Nature and a 
sense of the mystery and wonder of human life." — London Quarterly 
RevtfW, 

"This book [yf Hundred Voices] is a thesaurus of passionate beauty and 
hymns by a man who is a Pantheist, one who utters the 'Everlasting 
Yea' of Nietzsche to Nature and all her works. In the original Greek 
his poems ought to be a priceless and immortal treasure. The transla- 
tion of Mr. Phoutrides is as perfect a thing as can be done. It is a 
work of love and imderstanding. Mr. Phoutrides has enriched our 
emotional and intellectual worlds." — Benjamin de Casseres in the New 
York Herald^ July 31, 1921.

If American periodical literature has today a little peak, a little group of 
joumaU. raisins it to the level of the best of European cosmopolitanism, or at any 
rate in that direction, it is because you and your small paper showed how, editor- 
ially and economically, it could be done.

RESURGAM" 



l: BIRTH 



OUT of the dust Thou hast raised me, God of the 
living; 
Out of the dust Thou hast raised me and brought me to 

the light of morning. 
My eyes are full of the wonders of creation, 
And my spirit leaps within me. 
I behold Thy glory lifted into mountains, 
Thy kindness deepened into valleys. 
Thy hospitable mercies poured unmeasured in the seas. 
In plenteous ways Thou hast devised the telling of Thy 

dreams, 
Entreating beauty from the clay, 
And quickening man from out his dusty silence. 

^Co^yrighi, 1921, by LoiOse Ayres Ganutt, AU rights rts^md. 

Thou floatest flakes of color in the air, land, breathing on 

them, 
Wingest them to life; 
Thou callest the dazed leviathan up from the watery 

reaches, 
And summonest vasty creatures who come lumbering past, 
Astonished at their being. 
Who am I, Lord of Creation, that Thou ishouldst think 

upon me? 
Beside a mountain or a soaring bird, what am I that Thou 

shouldst give me place? 

I can praise Thee, O God! 

I can praise Thee to the summit of my singing; 

With the flesh of me, with the breath of me, with the 

height of me! 
Increase my stature even as the trees. 
Increase my stature till I pass the oak and glimpse the 

towers of heaven! 
With the waters of gratitude I brim my cup and pour it 

at Thy feet; 
For thou hast shared the gift of life, and my spirit sings 

within me! 



II: LIFE 

Into the noon of labor I go forth that I may reap my 
destiny. 

[ii8] 



 



Louise Ayres Gamett 

Sorrow is my lot, and labor my achievement, 
The beauty of God's handiwork my compensation. 
Something within me springs like a fountain and urges me 

to joy; 
Sorrow is as beauty and labor as reward. 
Thou art become a greater God, O God, because of my 

endeavor. 
Listen through my ears, Thou of my singing sanctuary, 
Listen through my ears that I hear Thy silent music; 
Look through my eyes that I vision the unseen; 
Speak through my lips that I utter words of gladness. 
Walk Thou with me, work Thou through me, rest Thou 

in me, 
That I may make Thee manifest in all my ways. 
I will praise Thee, praise Thee with the labor of my hands 
And with the bounty of my spirit! 



Ill: DEATH 

Into the valley land my feet descend, and man may not 
go with me; 

But Thou, O God, companion me in love that I be un- 
afraid. 

The dream of death has flowered in my soul and sounds of 
earth fall dimly on my ears. 

Slowly the sun goes westering in the hills, and the crimson 
pageant of my passing hour 

Flames in their deeps and moves across the sky. 
Something within me reaches back to birth and fills me 

with exulting. 
As the waters of a river, sweep the wonders of creation 

through my being, 
And life and death are so inseparate I know not each from 

each. 

And yet a mighty fearing falls upon me. 

Shadows descend and blur the crimson hills. 

A wind flung from a womb of ice 

Blows from the shores of nothingness. 

The shadows shed their shoes of stealth; 

They run in naked swiftness from the hills 

Calling the hosts of darkness. 

The winds sing a song of fury, 

The winds arise and shout their passion down the world. 

Drained in a pitiless draught 

Are the splendors of the skies. 

Towers of cypress touch the heights; 

Even in a battlement of gloom 

The towers of cypress overwhelm the heavens. 

My peace is perished. 

My dreams are fallen from me. 

Into the night no planet speeds its glory; 

The stars are drowned. 

Lonely the hulk of a broken moon 

Lifts its bloody sail. 


Louise Ayres Gamett 

Merged into rushing torrents are the shadows and the 

winds; 
The shadows and the winds plunge high upon the shore 
And swallow all the world. 

Why hast Thou hidden Thyself, O God? 

Why hast Thou turned Thy face aside 

And burdened me with night? 

Where is my dream of death, 

And where its sanctuary? 

The heat of hell assails me; 

I am consumed in bitterness and pain. 

Reveal Thyself, O unforgetting Spirit! 

Reveal Thyself that I may be enshrined 

In the beauty of Thy presence. 

Drive forth this mocking counterfeit of Death, 

For it is Thou who art my Death, O living God, 

It is Thou who art my Death, and only Thou! 

My fearing passes from me: 

As a heavy mantle falling from tired shoulders. 

My fearing slips away. 

Candles are set at my feet that I be not lost forever. 

Thou hast heard my cry, O Great Bestower! 

Thou hast heard my cry. Thou hast lifted me up. 

Thou hast delivered me! 

Now does the hush of night lie purple on the hills. 
The moon walks softly in a trance of sleep; 

Her whiteness cools the passion of the skies. 

I hang my quiet lute upon her curve 

And let the night winds chant my requiem. 

Waters of peace arise and drift me down the spaciousness 

of silence and of sleep; 
God lights H s solemn watch-fires overhead to keep the 

vigil of man's mystery. 

In the triumph of surrender I take Thy gift of sleep. 
Lean low, Thou Shepherd of my dreams; lean low to meet 

me as I lift on high 
The chalice of my dying. 



IV : RE-BIRTH 

I feel my spirit stir and half awake, 

Then look in bright bewilderment at dawn. 

O waking past all dreaming! 

Love Imperious that hast called me forth from out my 

valley's shadow! 

A mighty whirlwind, breath of the living God, 

Sweeps from beyond the barricades of night, and, stooping 

low, 
Lifts me from out my dust and sets me free. 

1 feel the Power that moors me to Itself; 
That keeps the rhythmic pattern of the stars; 
That spins, like a fiery plaything in the air, 


Louise Ayres Gamett 

The earth that was my home. 

My hour is great with leisure; 

My day is manifest. 

O clamorous world! — thy wasting fires 

Have burned themselves to ashes. 

foolish pomp! — thy futile stride 

As an image in a glass has passed away. 
Time's mystery and menace are resolved: 
The Now of Man is God's Forevermore. 

My heart is as a forest treed with wonder. 

The cymbals of my joyance make a stirring sound, 

My singing shakes the day. 

1 know myself at last: 

Thou, glorious One, hast revealed me to myself. 

As new-born planets sang in ecstasy. 

So sing the voices of my thankfulness. 

I praise Thee! 

I glorify Thee! 

Thou art the Singer, man Thy Song; 

My spirit on its summit shouts Thy name! 

Singer, Who hast sent me forth, 

1 am returned to Thee! 

Louise Ayres GameU 




 






POETRY: A Magazine of Verse 

THE HOSTAGE 

In dead of dark to his starry North 

Saint Nicholas drew near — 

He had ranged the world this wintry night, 

His elk-bells jangling clear. 

Now bitter-worn with age was he, 

And weary of mankind, for few 

Had shown him love or courtesy. 

His sacks lay empty — all save one; 

And this to his affright 

Stirred as he stooped with fingers numb, 

Ablaze with hoar-frost bright. 

Aghast he stood. Showed fumbling thumb. 

Small shoulder, a wing — what stowaway 

Was this, and whence was 't come? 

And out there crept a lovely Thing — 

Half angel and half child: 
"I, youngest of all Heaven, am here, to be thy joy," he 

smiled. 
"O Nicholas, our Master Christ thy grief hath seen; 

and He 
Hath bidden me come to keep His tryst, and bring His 

love to thee: 
To serve thee well, and sing Nowell, and thine own son 

to be." 

fFaher de la Mare 


SUPERNAL DIALOGUE 

Two beings 

Stood on the edge of things — 
Their breath was space j 
And their eyes were suns. 

I It was this way he passed — 
I know the sound. 

// More worlds — 

He can not forbear — 

/ Look down this lane — 
It was dark till he passed. 
Do you see — anything? 

// Seeds of light — glowing, whirling — 
A handful. 

/ Separating now. 

// Fierce fire-balls — 

So many — so many. Will he get what he wants- 
The perfect flower? 

/ Flower of delight — to bloom beside his throne? 
Sometime he will. 
[A pause] 

I Look — that little one — 
Burning, aching — 
Trailing its tiny orbs — 


POETRY; A Magazine of Verse 

II Which one? 

/ See — scarlet — oh, alive! 

Deep in that right-hand cluster near the dark. 

// Wth tiny trailers — will it be one of them? 
That clouded one, maybe? 

/ Look — it foams down. 
The clouds lift — 
There are seas — 

// Lands — a creeping green — 
Sounds of air moving. 

/ Hush — oh, whisper! — do you see 
Dark specks that crawl? 
And wings that flash in the air? 

// Spawn — immeasurably minute. 

What does he mean, the fecund one, creating without 
reason or mercy? 

/ He must — ^life is his song. 
He dreams — he wills. 

// Watch now — they change, those atoms. 

They stand on end — they lay stone on stone — 
They go clad — they utter words. 

/ Proud — they take their spoil. 
Kings — and slaves. 


Harriet Monroe 

II Oh queer — ingenious! They gather in towns, 

They filch our fires to carry them over land and sea. 

/ They measure the stars — they love — they dream. 

// But war — pain — obliterative war and pain. 

/ So brief— each one a tiny puflF— and out. 

// Grotesque! 

/ A few look up — salute us before they fall. 
A few dare face him. 

// Is it enough? 

[A pause] 

I It cools down — their whirling world. 
It is silent — cold. 

// Has he lost again? Can he fail? 

/ Who are we to question? Though he fail again and 
again — 

// Yes, who arc we? 

/ He must go on — he must get the flower. 

Two beings 

Stood on the edge of things — 
Their breath was space y 
And their eyes were suns. 



Harriet Monroe 


TWO NEGRO SPIRITUALS 

A DREAM 

I had a dream last night, a wonderful dream. 
I saw an angel riding in a chariot — 
Oh, my honey, it was a lovely chariot. 
Shining like the sun when noon is on the earth. 
I saw his wings spreading from moon to earth; 
I saw a crown of stars upon his forehead; 
I saw his robes agleaming like his chariot. 
I bowed my head and let the angel pass, 
Because no man can look on Glory's work; 
I bowed my head and trembled in my limbs. 
Because I stood on ground of holiness. 
I heard the angel in the chariot singing: 

''Hallelujah early in the morning! 

I know my Redeemer liveth — 

How is it with your soul?" 

I stood on ground of holiness and bowed; 
The River Jordan flowed past my feet 
. As the angel soothed my soul with song, 
A song of wonderful sweetness. 
I stooped and washed my soul in Jordan's stream 
Ere my Redeemer came to take me home; 
I stooped and washed my soul in waters pure 
As the breathing of a new-born child 


Fenton Johnson 



Lying on a mammy's breast at night. 
I looked and saw the angel descending 
And a crown of stars was in his hand: 
"Be ye not amazed, good friend," he said, 
"I bring a diadem of righteousness, 
A covenant from the Lord of life. 
That in the morning you will see 
Eternal streets of gold and pearl aglow 
And be with me in blessed Paradise." 

The vision faded. I awoke and heard 
A mocking-bird upon my window-sill. 



THE WONDERFUL MORNING 

When it is morning in the cornfield 
I am to go and meet my Jesus 

Riding on His white horse. 
When it is morning in the cornfield 
I am to be there in my glory. 

Shout, my brethren! Shout, my sisters! 
I am to meet the King of. Morning 

Way down in the cornfield. 

Fenton Johnson 


HANDFUL OF ASHES 

THE CAPTIVE 

Beauty that shakes in lights. 
Beauty that gleams in mists. 

Loveliness of still nights. 
Gold of the stars that twists, 

Ribbon-like, into the sea . . . 

Beauty is calling me. 

Delicate crimson flames. 

Jewels with long histories, 
Mysterious oft-said names, 

Blossoms beneath great trees. 
Melodies deep and low, 
Call me. I can not go. 

Heliotrope, jasmine, rose; 

Lovers, at crumbling gates; 
Silence, when eyelids dose; 

Cliffs, where the sea-bird mates: 
Beauty holds these for me 
Whose eyes are too blind to see. 

Beauty, when sunbeams blur. 

Calls me again and again. 
I can not answer her. 

Beauty shall call me in vain, 


Dorothy Dow 



Sadly, from year to year . . 
Passion has chained me here. 



WAITING 

If you should walk in the park and not find me, 

Or go in the market-place and not see me, 

Would you not search further? 

Does not your heart tell you I am somewhere? 

Go out on the long roads — I may be at the end of one. 

The sea to the ship, 
The river to the little boat, 
The cloud to the swallow — 
One for the other, always. 
And I, for you, forever. 

FUTILITY 

The nights grow long and the days cold — 

I dream of you and love. 

The dead leaf, falling from the tree. 

Is not more sad than memory; 

Nor is the rising wind as bold 

As were your lips on me. ... 

(What are you thinking of?) 

The streets and trees and people pass 
Like words beneath my pen; 

Symbols, below a painted sky — 
I have no part in them. I lie 
Futile as footsteps on the grass. 
Wind-torn, storm-drenched; I long to die. 
(You might remember . . . then.) 

BOUND 

Take away the magic 

You have put on me: 
I am held by whispers — 

I, who would be free. 

I who would be free and false. 

Why must I be true? 
I fear to move, for hurting 

The clinging thoughts of you. 

So the sunny branches 

Beckon me in vain: 
I, beside the hearth-fire. 

Huddle to my pain. 



Dorothy Dow 




FROM A BAY-WINDOW 

My world is a pane of glass. These only 

Of the shadowy without are mine: 

They that pass; 

The gray birds fluttering by; 

The cloud that sometimes sails 

Over the chimney-bitten sky^ 

When all else fails. 

AUTUMN RAIN 

To eyes hollow 
With the gray distress 
The passing swallow 
Is all but a caress. 

STEEPLES 

They gaily pass 

Within 

Who would be freed {en masse) 

Of sin. 

PORTRAIT OF AN OLD LADY 

Up flutters a hand to caress — 
Midway in the prayer — 
Her Sabbath dress. 
The frail gray of her hair. 

TO A DEAD LOVE 

Why, O love, 

Shall I not sing, 

Who above her child 

Would plant a flowering thing? 

TO FELIX 

Clear as water pooled in a cup 

I hear your thoughts 

Through all the spaciousness of my unrest. 

You have no place 

For the white bird at my breast. 

Or the face your hands lift up. 

APRIL SNOW 

Oh, your words are bitter to me 
As these last flakes of snow are 
To the little shining buds; but no bud 
That glistens like a raindrop on a tree 
Is so fresh with love. 



SOLACE 



Knock at my pane 
With your finger-tips, 
O rain. 







BEACH SONO 



What arc they weaving under the water? 
They make sheer laces and drag them down. 
They ruffle a lawn with a great grieving. 
What are they making — what manner of gown? 

What are they weaving, caught here, 
Caught there, on the thin-washed blue? 
Who is to be married or who is to be buried. 
Under the water, under the water? 

SONG ON DEATH 

Death comes inexorably. His pale deft hand 
Is never still. Swift and impalpable 
He comes, taking what he will. Life is a circle 
Which has gone its round. He tarries 
Where old women sit, peering at the ground. 

OUT OF A CAVALCADE OF DUST 

In such a white procession. 

In such a guise. 

The dead might return 

With pantomime of lips and eyes. 




GREY CRUST 

I am weary, unto desire of death. 
Of the thought fretting in my body, 
Of the body wrapped round my thought. 

They go — 

The curious panting creatures I would be — 

Along the grey crust of the street. 

I would be fused into her — 
Girl going whither I know not! 
I would have her shrill eager breasts — 
Gusts of storm driving the sail of her blouse; 
Her round polished knees, rising, moving like pendulums- 
Engines urging the sail of her skirt; 
Her sharp bird-like head cleaving the sail of the wind. 
I would have the curious blood of her, 
I would have her dream. 

I would be fused into him — 
Child carried in the arms of a mother. 
Child carried whither he knows not! — 
I would have the gurgling mirth 
Emanating from gay-colored baubles; 
The shiver, the sweat and the nightmare 
Emanating from dark wrangling shadows: 
I would have his untinted history, 


Laurence Vail 

And the hunger 

To seize the whole world by the mouth. 

I would be fused into anyone going new ways. 

Laurence Vail 



TWO POEMS 

WILL POWER 

I would rather grind my teeth to powder, 

I would rather tread barefoot on thin, sharp stones, 

I would rather let the blood of my veins freeze to red ice. 

And the muscles of my legs stiffen to cold stone. 

Than be drawn by the warm breath 

Of transient things. 

I would rather — 

But . . . yet . . . 

I am being drawn ... I am being drawn . . . 

PAIN 

It is 

The hush that falls 

When screaming chords, drawn taut, 

Break with a sudden snap! — and then 

Recoil. 

Henry Saul Zolinsky

ARPEGGIO

Only one sways toward the moon face.

SEMPER EADEM 

Cheeks that are sunk and ashen, 
Eyes that weep in vain: 
Always the same passion 
In the same futile fashion, 
And the same pain — 
Forever begun again.

NEURIADE 

LAKE 

Sitting on a bench facing God's beautiful lake, 
A poem to God beautiful. 

Lake Michigan, 

The love a poor sick body held 

(Sifted by the sift of a hundred nights of pain), 

A poor sick body gave it all to you. 

Your absinthe 
Has intoxicated me. 

Having risen out of your waters. 

In front of my great eyes now 

There is a mad blur of sunlight. 

And the City spread out before me calling from a great 

curve: 
"Come, enter, conquistador!" 

The line of your horizon, pure and long, hitched to the 

infinite both ways. 
Where the mist lies like Peace. 

Swimming, I flirted with Death; 
Saw death running over the shadow-laced ripples; 
And turned around, as you threw water in my eyes, 
And laughed at Death, as Death's brother, the devil, 
would. 

You slammed open the doors of the sky, 
And there stood the tremendous sun. 

Lake, gilded in the morning, 

I have come out of you, 

A fresh-water Neptune; 

And the water rang little bells 

Trickling down 

Along my flesh. 

Lake, garden of the colors, 

Sweet-breathing mouth of Chicago, 

Words die in the fingers of a sick man, 

As children dying on a poor father. 

Take my promise, lake. 

SLEEP 

At the bottom of the abyss of sleep 

A black cradle rocks. 

Pain, slight, with evanescent fingers 

Pushes it. 

Under the cradle is earth. 

To cover and stifle you. 

AUBADE 

The morning now 
Is a white corpse — 
The nightmares 


Emanuel Camevali 



KUled her. 
Vainly the breeze 
Wafts a terrible sadness 
Over her body. 



ENCOUNTER 

Little grey lady sitting by the roadside in the cold, 
My fire is to warm you, not to burn you up. 

Little grey lady in your little grey house in the warmth, 
Your warmth is to loosen my frozen arms and tongue, 
Not to drowse me. 



SERMON 

Chao-Mong-Mu freely laid his hands over the sky: 
You do not know how to lay your hands over the breasts 
of your beloved. 

Chao-Mong-Mu made the tree dance at his will: 
You do not know how to hug a rough tree and say 
"darling" to it. 

Chao-Mong-Mu magnificently ran a shaft of sunlight to 

smash against the treetops: 
You walk carefully, carefully, and fend oflF the sunlight 

with your grey clothes, although you're very poor. 

Chao-Mong-Mu painted a sky that was a pink-fleshed 
vase; then he became a very small thing and hid in 
the vase: 

You build yourselves immense houses to live in, and you 
are afraid even there. 



HOPE 

Tomorrow will be beautiful, 

For tomorrow comes out of the lake. 



INSOMNIA 

For a year his desperate hands beat the darkness. Then 
out of their rhythm a monster was created: 

Three claws on his breast, so that he could not with 
facility heave it; 

Three claws on his skull, so that he had waking night- 
mares the year long. 

When at last his hands dropped, the monster stooped 
over him, and with his yellow beak plucked out his 
white heart. 

SMOKE 

All the smoke of the cigarettes of dreamers went over 
to the sky, and formed that blue vault you see up 
there. 




Emanuel Camevali 



FUNERAL MARCH 



The great corpse 
Is the crowd. 

A whole day 

It takes to bury it. 

In the morning 
They begin; 

Not at night, 
For they're afraid. 

I'm here for . . . 

Oh, to wail a great goodbye. 



ITALIAN SONG 



Until your lips be red, 
Until the winter-time, 
Until the money be gone. 
Until God see us: 
Until God see us. 

Until old age come, girl. 
Until the other man come. 
Until the jettatura get me, 
Until God see us: 
Until God see us. 



OLD ACCUSTOMED IMPUDENT GHOST 

That morning the dawn arose from the sodden grey city 

pavements, 
And it was a sick grey breath. 
I had spent myself asking the night for sleep. 

Broken in pieces I was — only the evil spirit was whole 

in me; 
There was a curse on my bitten bloody lips. . . • 
And then . . . 

Oh, then the old accustomed, impudent ghost came in: 
He wore my bagged, ragged pants, and was unshaven; 
And his face was the one I had seen in the mirror 
Too many times. 

INVOCATION TO DEATH 

Let me 

Close my eyes tight. 

Still my arms. 

Let me 

Be. 

Then, 

G>me! 

Let me be utterly alone: 

Do not let the awful understanding that comes with 

The thought of Death 

Bother me. 


Emanuel Camevali 

Your love was not strong enough to hold me. 

Death takes things away: 

I have them here in my hands, 

The rags. 

I do not understand the cosmic humor 
That lets foolish impossibilities, like me, live. 

I have made a mess of it, 
But I am no debtor. 

It's the yearning of a nervous man, 
The yearning for peace. 
The curiosity for a word: 
Forever. 

If she would only come quietly, 

like a lady — 

The first lady and the last. 

Just not to hear any longer 

The noise swelling from the morning streets. 

Nor the two desperate sparrows chirruping; 

Just not to fear any longer 

The landlady. 

Emanuel Camevali 


COMMENT 

RENEWAL OF YOUTH 

THE Christmas season, winter-clad as it is, always 
utters the prophecy of youth. Celebrating the birth 
of a great renewer of life, it rings the first far-away bell, 
waves the first red-and-green banner, to usher in the 
springtime. It reminds us of the perennial miracle, the 
unconquerable hope and joy forever freshly blooming in 
the new life of this earth. 

The passage of the generations — that is the great 
poem. The long epic of birth, growth and decay — the 
struggle of life to assert its dominion over destructive 
forces, the momentary conquest and the final defeat — 
this is the universal story of which all lesser tales are 
mere chapters and paragraphs. Absorbed in our small 
aflfairs, singing our individual little solos, we too often 
miss the immense chorus vibrating grandly through the 
ages — a chorus which accepts and harmonizes the whir 
of the cricket and the long drum-roll of the stars. 

Life's bitter and unceasing fight is against the forces 
of decay: when it lapses, and turns to fight the forces of 
growth, the result is confusion and disaster. Through 
the battering by young minds alone may each generation 
forget to grow old; therefore let youth be free and strong, 
let it have room for its race and its shout, lest bars and 
shackles enslave the next age. 


Renewal of Youth 

The battering by young minds — perhaps an editor's 
office, especially a poetry-editor's office, is the place 
most accessible of all to such battering, the place where 
some of the freest and strongest of young minds love to 
put up their first stiff fight against the forces of decay. 
Too often they find these forces entrenched in the editorial 
chair, so that the battlefield is conveniently narrowed 
down and the issue personified. And the editor, if he 
waives all advantage of position, age, experience, etc., 
will have to put up the best fight he is capable of, and 
often come out second-best at the end of it. 

A recent article on This Youngest Generation by Malcolm 
Cowley {New York Evening Post Literary Review of 
October 15th) shows with what a simple gesture the young 
mind can throw away the immediate past — at least of 
its own race and language. Youth must avenge itself, 
not on the honored dead, but on the too-much-honored 
living; and so we find Shaw and Wells and Mencken and 
all the Georgian poets and prosers — and, oh yes, Chester- 
ton and Schnitzler and Nathan — cast into the discard, 
while youth is reading Flaubert and Laforgue and Huys- 
mans, diving deeper into the past toward Swift and 
Defoe, Racine, Moli^re, even Marlowe, Ben Jonson and 
Shakespeare, and then coming up again to salute Remy 
de Gourmont and certain new groups of French poets 
to whom he showed the way. Through all this the 
young writers are shaping their own ideals: there is to be 
"a new interest in form," "a simplification of current 

life into something rich and strange"; "our younger 
literature will be at least as well composed as a good 
landscape — it may even attain to the logical organization 
of music." 

Form, simplification, strangeness, respect for literature as an art 
with traditions, abstractness — these are the catchwords that are repeated 
most often among the younger writers. They represent ideas that have 
characterized French literature hitherto, rather than English or Amer- 
ican. They are the nearest approach to articulate doctrine of a 
generation without a school and without a manifesto. 

Le rot est morty but he has prepared the people for the 
new reign: 

The great advantage of this generation is the fact that a public has 
been formed. It has been formed exactly by those inchoate realists, 
like Dreiser, and by those anti-Puritanical critics, like H. L. Mencken, 
against whom this youngest generation is in revolt. But gratitude 
is not a literary virtue. 

Yes, here as elsewhere gratitude is the rarest of the — 
shall we say, not virtues, but graces? It is an education 
in a still rarer virtue, and grace — humility, to note how 
easily the rising generation puts the risen one in its place. 
Shaw, Mencken, Dreiser — how they pawed the ground 
and trod the air not so long ago! What rebels, icono- 
clasts they were as they leapt all barriers toward the 
glamourous goal of art! Now conquering youth is 
mounted — soon he will ride them down with joy. Le rot 
est mort — for what happy heir shall we soon be shouting, 
''Viveleroir?

Renewal of Youth 

Yes, the wave-movement of the arts is one phase of 
the universal epic. Birth, growth, decay; new birth, 
fresh growth, and yet at last decay — the rule is for you 
and me as well as another, and in each of us it is proved. 
So hail to conquering Youth — even to sacred Infancy 
in its mother's arms! May the newly risen or newly 
born solve the riddles and sing the songs of the world! 
May he rid the earth of war and disease, of poverty and 
ignorance — famine of«body and soul! May he complete 
nature's beauty with the beauty of art, and nature's 
truth with the truth of the spirit, and lead on the mil- 
lennium to which we all aspire! H. M. 

ALEXANDER BLOK 

Alexander Blok's death in the late summer is a loss 
not only to Russia but to world-literature. He was 
forty-one years of age, and had achieved international 
fame only during the last two years through the circula- 
tion of his revolutionary lyric. The Twelve. He was the 
first distinguished Russian writer to espouse openly the 
Bolshevist cause, and was one of the few first-rate imagina- 
tions which seem to have been sufficiently nourished 
upon the black bread of revolution. In his youth he 
was a writer of intense and remote lyrics, full of mystic 
vision and the pungent odor of the flowers of evil. The 
translators point out that Blok "owed a cultural allegiance 
to the old order." But he had from the first, like the 


typical Russian peasant, adored the Christ hanging in 
tormented efBgy at the wind-raked cross-roads, and 
marching before the poor, their Brother of compassion; 
and it was inevitable that Blok should not despair of 
the blind, violent, but spiritual people, discovering in 
their wild fury the elements of redemption. 

For the world of intellectual irony seemed to him 
rotten and ready for destruction. The nineteenth 
century, he wrote, "has cast upon the living face of man 
a blinding mask of mechanics, positivism, and economic 
materialism, and has drowned the human voice in the 
rumble and roar of machinery." As to whether Blok 
felt before he died that the, administrators of this revolu- 
tion were betraying their ideal, "loving Her in heaven 
and betraying Her on earth," opinions seem to differ. 
Certainly there is little likeness between the cold, dedi- 
cated Cromwellian executives who now direct the Soviet 
government, and the twelve mystic roisterers of Blok's 
The Twelve^ writen in 191 8. 

This poem, the Russian edition of which exceeded 
two million copies, was recently translated by Miss 
Deutsch and Dr. Yarmolinsky. It portrays the pro- 
cession, through the streets of Red Petrograd, of twelve 
holy ruffians, looting, killing, singing. The scheme of 
the poem is bold and flexible, including revolutionary 
songs, an episode of low passion and jealousy terminated 
by murder, and penetrating lyric passages with a move- 
ment like the folk-song. There is occasional convincing 


Alexander Blok 

symbolism, as when the old order is personified by a 
mangy cur: "Beatings are the best you'll get." Behind 
all the lurid light and noise is the huge bare vision, the 
flat endless unmoved steppe: 

Hatted Russia 
Thick-rumped and solid — 
Russia, the stolid. 

In the storm and cold the blackguards stumble on, like 
disciples of a starved gray-bearded introspective Dionysus. 
At the end of the poem, they meet their master, in- 
scrutable, pitying, crowned with flowers — the white 
untouched Christ, bearing the red flag: 

In mist-white roses garlanded, 

Christ marches on. The twelve are led. 

The Twelve is a stirring battle-song which will not soon 
be dissociated from the history of these mysterious 
blood-dripping days. The translation, while it gives 
little impression of beauty as English verse, permits 
the smoky fire of the original to shine through.

A FLOURISH OF TRUMPETS 

Second Aprils by Edna St. Vincent Millay. Mitchell 

Kennerley. 

If I could only sound a fanfare in words! If I could 
get up on some high place and blow trumpets, and shout 

[ISO 




 

and wave my hands and throw my hat! If, too, I could 
gather together all those of my dear friends who have 
said: "Oh yes, I like poetry well enough — Longfellow, 
and Byron and those; of course I admit I can't under- 
stand this modern stuff!'' And if I could gather together 
all the shrugging shoulders, all the supercilious smiles, 
and all those brows which have knitted at the mention 
of poetry, and could read to them — or get Edna St. 
Vincent Millay to read to them, if it were only possible! — 
her latest book, Second April! And .then if I could give 
it to all those hungry people who have not the money 
for beauty, and give it to children — even be generous 
with it! — and let it lie on the library table of the fashion- 
able house, beside the Golden Treasuryy where it might 
be picked up by the casual caller so that he would get 
drunk in a new way! And later, after the shy emotions 
and the jaded ones have had their dance in the sun, if 
I could get away to some deserted place of beauty, and 
hold a solitary revel, an orgy of poetry! 

And yet even if the copies of Second April rained down 
like manna, I suppose there would still be some, among 
the most needy, to spurn the fare, some who would look, 
and look in vain, for intricacies of form, for startling 
words, for grotesque similes, for splashing impressionistic 
phrases. And there would be those who would think 
an occasional sonnet indecent, because it flings high, 
unashamed, the joy of living! 

Not with libation, but with shouts and laughter 


A Flourish of Trumpets 

We drenched the altars of Love's sacred grove, 
Shaking to earth green fruits, impatient after 
The launching of the colored moths of Love. 
Love's proper myrtle and his mother's zone 
We bound about our irreligious brows, 
And fettered him with garlands of our own. 
And spread a banquet in his frugal house. 
Not yet the god has spoken; but I fear, 
Though we should break our bodies in his flame. 
And pour our blood upon his altar, here 
Henceforward is a grove without a name — 
A pasture to the shaggy goats of Pan, 
Whence flee forever a woman and a man. 

Perhaps, there would be some to belittle the group of 

memorial poems, each one of which is so childlike in its 

simplicity — so utterly, utterly poignant: 

Heap not on this mound 
Roses that she loved so well; 
Why bewilder her with roses. 
That she cannot see or smell? 
She is happy where she lies 
With the dust upon her eyes. 

And the stark tragedy of the Chorus: 

Give away her gowns, 
Give away her shoes; 
She has no more use 
For her fragrant gowns. 
Take them all down — 
Blue, green, blue. 
Lilac, pink, blue — 
From their padded hangers. 
She will dance no more 
In her narrow shoes; 
Sweep her narrow shoes 
From the closet floor. 

And there would be the happy young girl who confided 
to me that she could not see anything particularly wonder- 
fill or apt in the sentence, "Life in itself is nothing — an 
empty cup, a flight of uncarpeted stairs." 

To what purpose, April, do you return again? 

Beauty is not enough. 

You can no bnger quiet me with the redness 

Of little leaves opening stickily. 

I know what I know. 

The sun is hot on my neck as I observe 

The spikes of the crocus. 

The smell of the earth is good. 

It is apparent that there is no death. 

But what does that signify? 

Not only under ground are the brains of men 

Eaten by maggots. 

Life in itself 

Is nothing — 

An empty cup, a flight of uncarpeted stairs. 

It is not enough that yearly, down this hill, 

April 

Comes like an idiot, babbling and strewing flowers. 

Yet in spite of them all, and I believe there could only 
be a few — the meticulous, the unfortunates whose emo- 
tions have irretrievably atrophied — in spite of them, 
and right in their faces, I would shout aloud, blow 
trumpets, wave hands, and scatter Edna St. Vincent 
Millay's Second April over the world!

Fletcherian Colors 

FLETCHERIAN COLORS 

Breakers and Granite^ by John Gould Fletcher. Mac- 

millan Co. 

This volume of poems, while not a definite attempt to 
comprehend and express the spirit of America, by com- 
bining various groups leaves a general impression. The 
spirit which speaks loudest, however, is a universal one, 
although our ardent patriotism usually leads us to confine 
it to America. 

It is a palimpsest which no one reads or understands, which none has 
time to heed, a loom-frame woven over with interspersed entangled 
threads, of which the meaning is lost, from which the pattern is not yet 
freed. 

They are a great shallow sea, crinkling uneasily as if some giant's 
body were wallowing beneath. 

The shuttles clatter and clamor and hammer at the woof of day and 
night. But the being — the thing that will master all the ages — still 
refuses to be born. 

One does not squeeze this essence from the book, 
but finds it imbedded in long descriptions, externally 
conceived; often with the eye of a decorator nicely 
designed, more often with the hand of an artisan who 
labors over his pile of adjectives and colors and leaves 
a jumble. 

Down the Mississippi is the best group. It has a 
sculptural quality in spite of certain passages which, 
with their natural southern heat, threaten to melt the 
modeling into a mass. But it is an excellent group. A 

[iss] 




 

fine conception of a great river, moulded and colored 
by sensitive hands, guided by sympathetic eyes. 

Of his prose poems — The Building of ChicagOy The Old 
South and The Song of the fVind—The Old South is the 
most completely satisfying. It has quality and cadence 
and flavor. It charms and saddens, and leaves a stagnant 
pool in the spirit. The other prose poems in the volume 
work out of inspiration hours. There are some interest- 
ing photographs, some historical descriptions. An eflFort 
is made at times to heighten them to the point of poetry 
by the use of the names of strong colors, but the words 
are cold, they do not flush from within. The lines are 
sterile, and hanging decorations on them does not make 
them burgeon. 

In New Yorky this sentence begins well: 

Ivory and gold, heart of light petrified, bold and immortally beauti- 
ful, lifts a tower like a full lily-stalk. 

Then it grows hysterical: 

With crammed pollen-coated petals, flame-calyx fretted and carven, 
white phoenix that beats its wings in the light, shrill ecstasy of leaping 
lines poised in flight, partaken of joy in the skies, mate of the sun. 

We frequently encounter this violent use of language, 
but for the most part the poet*s carousals in the names 
of colors fail to intoxicate him. 

In The Grand Canyon of The Colorado 

Yellow, red, grey-green, purple-black chasms fell swiftly below 
each other — 

and 


Fletcherian Colors 

hammered from red sandstone, purple granite, and gold — 
fail in their purpose, while 

It was hidden 

Behind layers of white silence 

paints a picture. 

Again, take from The Well in the Desert^ 

The desert below him seems burning: ashen-yellow, 
red-yellow, faint blue and rose-brown — 

and 

At the horizon 

The heat rose and fell. 

Sharp flickering arpeggios . . . 

Not a cloud-flake breaks with its shadow the great space 
of sky and of earth. 

The last two are Japanese prints, while the first is a 
colored photograph. 

Mr. Fletcher's use of colors makes one feel their limita- 
tions; only occasionally does one feel their infinite variety. 

The poems to the eye seem unrestrained, but there 
is not the flamboyant coloring of youth in these pages. 
Taking the volume as a whole, one feels a prodigal use 
of words of color but a paucity of colored words. If 
the Japanese prints, a few of which it undoubtedly 
possesses, were selected from the whole we should have 
a slimmer volume but a more rarely beautiful collection. 


MINOR CHORDS 

Bluestone^ by Marguerite Wilkinson. Macmillan Co. 
Selected Poems y by Lady Margaret Sackvillc. E. P. Dutton 

&Co. 

These two books have no likeness of matter or manner 
that innately justifies their being written about together. 
My apology is that the authors of both are women, and 
that the books are both provided with prefaces so pro- 
vocative that they stimulate attention perhaps more than 
the poetry itself. 

Marguerite Wilkinson's preface is autobiographical, like 
her verses. It invites us into her workshop, as in her 
poems she invites us candidly into her homely house of 
life — into the kitchen and living-rooms and the empty 
nursery — to show us the vistas she likes, her porch and 
garden, her big husband, to chat a little about her ances- 
tors and the poor and the weather, and to confide the 
mournful secret of her childlessness. In her workshop she 
lets us stand by while, between the stages of her demon- 
stration of lyric-making, she gives an informal lecture. 

To report the lecture briefly, for a summary may be 
made in a sentence — the poet may help himself by finding 
the tune which exists for each expression, and building 
them up together. She says: 

What happens is simply this: While I am making a lyric, after the 
mood becomes clear, after the idea and image emerge from consciousness, 
I sing it, and sometimes slowly, sometimes quite rapidly, the words take 
their places in lines that carry a tune also. I am not giving conscious 


Minor Chords 

effort to the tune; nor am I making an intellectual effort to combine 
words and music to get a certain effiect. I am not thinking about the 
music. I am making a single-heartM and strong endeavor to say or 
sing what is felt or thought. 

This leaves one well elbowed for reflection. Is this the 
way epics and folk-songs were written — did the bards and 
skalds and troubadours make their resonant verses thus? 
Is it analogous to the activities of any other poet — say 
Kreymborg, or Vachel Lindsay, in their somewhat readier 
improvisation? 

As for the poems themselves, they are individually 
undistinguished. But a full sequential reading of them 
makes one aware of a bright, impulsive, open temper- 
ament, a small clear voice singing a small clear soul. It is 
frank and personal in the way that women are frank and 
personal, not a challenge but a confidence. It is auto- 
biography as self-concerned and intimate, in its demure 
scale, as that of Benvenuto Cellini. 

Mrs. Wilkinson writes most stridently, most rhetor- 
ically, when, as in the title-poem, she invokes ancestors. 
Songs from beside Swift Rivers is a pleasant, energetic 
group, although it contains the worst thing in the book, 
The Really Truly Twirly-whirly Eel. In Preferences ^ Long 
SongSy Songs of an Empty House^ Songs of Laughter and 
Tears i Whims for Poets and California Poems she does 
better work. These in a certain way satisfy if they do 
not thrill us; they are, if not original, personal. Here she 
is busy on her autobiography; she tells a small old story, 
offers a bright comment. 

The closing poem, however, The Pageant^ is to my mind 

the finest of the book. It is almost the only impersonal 

poem. It is not new or profound; but it is a conceit such 

as comes coolly from the hands of women whereas men's 

hands mold sweatily and hard; also men's eyes are sneer- 

ingly careless while women's are maternally watchful. I 

will quote the second stanza, and take my leave of a book 

pleasant but not upsetting, containing some singularly 

inept verses which, however, may help in the final witnessing 

of an unheroic, untormented and engaging personality: 

Forever is a broad road where have met together 
Brave Deeds in red robes and Deeds of golden fire; 
Grave Deeds in silver gowns, quaint Deeds in modey, 
Quiet Deeds in homely gray that only saints admire; 
Gentle Deeds that love the green raiment of the summer; 
Pure Deeds in very white without the chill of snow; 
Squalid Deeds in dull rags, pitiful and ugly: 
Down the broad highway they go. 

The testimonial to Lady Margaret Sackville's Selected 
Poems is written by no less a doctor than Wilfrid Scawen 
Blunt. It is short and perfunctory, having the familiar 
sound of the literary ballyhoo. It begins by calling her 
ladyship the best of England's woman poets. Being quite 
ignorant of the poetry young Britannia is writing, I can- 
not enter into controversy. But I remember some sharp 
work by the feminine Sitwell; and'some interesting percept 
tions in quotations from Charlotte Mew; and even though 
the women of talent, like the men, are diluting their poetry 
in the traditional English schooner, the novel — Virginia 
Wolf, May Sinclair, Dorothy Richardson, E. M. Delaficld 

[i6o] 



 



Minor Chords 

and others — there must be women who are writing poetry 
less pallid and Hellenic, and more original than this. 

Mr. Blunt, like other comfortable people, is waiting for 
the world to quiet down to "its ancient bourgeois ways of 
peace, prosperity, romance, and beauty.'* We may look 
for the blooming of an art that will cover the ruins, a 
peaceful bourgeois poetry written in the benignant, 
lattice-tempered "daylight of sound rhyme, metre and 
melody," like Lady Sackville's. It will even be free from 
the rhetorical independence of blank verse, which is "not 
really verse at all even in master-hands; say, rather, a 
dignified kind of prose pompous in recitation and, for 
common reading, dull." 

Mr. Blunt is sure it will emerge from the bewildered 
forms of the "delirium" — such profound, powerful, deny- 
ing poetry as is being written by D. H. Lawrence, the 
imagists, the Sitwells and Aldous Huxley. I gather that 
Mr. Blunt means them although he mentions no names. 
Their work is a delirium to him because their subject- 
matter is not the Greek hash served up by a muse whom 
people have made a slavey, but fresh fodder pungently 
spiced that gives savor and nourishment; because their 
measures are ungentle, and their language cleaned and 
filtered of the d6bris of overlapping preciosities. 

In spite of this survivor of the nineties, such feeble voices 
as Lady Sackville's will inevitably be silenced by the 
" delirium." True it is a voice of some subtle cadences; of 
a tone pleasing and serene. It even murmurs some 

[i6i] 




 

exquisite lyrics, offers some sonorous recitations, makes a 
shy jest. But it observes all the politeness of conven- 
tional rhyming; it never leaves its orderly park of culti- 
vated flower-beds exhaling a luxurious odor, with nymphs 
and fauns pensive among the trees, fastened forever in the 
postures of elegantly sylvan courtship. 

There is a staid, deliberate and wise sentiment in the 
war poems. They are not poignant or biographical, but 
they are pitying, even querulous, comments upon an 
organized cataclysm. They are bright bits of emotion, 
like bright colors against an elegant but monotonous 
background. 

Lady Sackville's poetry has none of the impulse and 
swing of Marguerite Wilkinson's. It is impersonal and 
detached, and does not leave us as a palpable presence. 
But it has greater delicacy, mellower polish, maturer 
choice of material. One can see in these books an analogy; 
for England and America, if England did not have its own 
r voltes and America its bland traditionalists.

POST-MARTIAL EMOTION 

Aurelia and Other PoemSy by Robert Nichols. E. P. 

Dutton and Gd. 

From the ardors and endurances of war this poet, like 
many another, has retired into his sensibilities. It isi 
a luxury no doubt justified in one who suffered so severe 
a war experience as Robert Nichols, but it is a disappoint- 


Post-martial Emotion 

ment to many who read his first book. From this earlier 
book there were two courses possible: one, to retain the 
war experience, if not its incidents, as a structural fact 
in his future work; the other, to throw it away as one 
would a soiled and bloody shirt and return to the cool, 
sterile delicacies of his domestic experience. With the 
exception of the beautifully reminiscent Yesterday^ the 
poet in this book has returned frankly to pre-war psy- 
chology and subject matter. The book as a whole, 
including. Four Idylls^ Encounters^ twenty-seven Elisa- 
bethan Sonnets to Aurelia^ The Flower of Flame^ has 
assumed in manner, emotion and subject the conventional 
limitations of the finely wrought but minor poetry of 
academic England. 

If war came without welcome, a thick and bulging 
episode in his experience, its subsidence at any rate has 
not left the poet voiceless. The transition from his 
engravings on the crude steel of war to their continuation 
on the ivory of peace is no doubt appropriate to this type 
of poet. Three strains of interest, none of them asso- 
ciated with warlike violence, may be noted: A con- 
templative and introspective interest, as in Night 
Rhapsody: 

How beautiful to wake at night, 

Within the room grown strange, and still, and sweet, 

And live a century while in the dark 

The dripping wheel of silence slowly turns; 

To watch the window open on the night, 

A dewy silent deep where nothing stirs, 

And, lying thus, to feel dilate within 

The press, the conflict, and the heavy pulse 

Of incommunicable sad ecstasy. 

An interest in nature observation, as in From the Budded 
Branch: 

Below a beetle on a stalk of grass 

Slowly unharnesses his shuttered wings. 
His tiny rainbow wings of shrivelled glass. 

He leaps 1 He whirs away. The grass-blade swings. 

An interest in personal emotion, as in the tritely facile 
Sonnets to Aurelia: 

Whatever substances of love may dwell 

Within the passionate heart of such as I, 
Whatever waters of pure pity well 

In the dark orb of a most loving eye, 
I have yielded you. Whatever were the pain 

If power within me so to do did live, 
I, at your need, had made these yours again, 

But now I know I have no more to give. 

But the weaver of these has not yet a certain hand. 
His imaginative facility, his ability to subordinate the 
crude image to the structural idea of his poem without 
diminishing its vividness, his technical excellence in 
poetic detail, do not save him from casualness in the 
larger principles of his work. 

It is unfortunate that Robert Nichols should have 
only the poised and static culture of his particular English 
group to support him. Rarely if ever does he break 
over the narrow boundaries of self-centered sophistication, 


Post-martial Emotion 

of fagged and too mature emotion. Mr. Nichols and 
his group seem to be too little in literary touch with the 
massive energies of contemporary life to be moved by 
any great or unifying poetic idea. The environment is 
luxuriously sweet to the minor poet, but its very gracious- 
ness undermines stronger men. It is too small a pot for 
great broth. In the gratuitous energy of great poetry 
this book is lacking. Baker Brownell 

COLOR SONATAS 

PoemSy by Iris Tree. John Lane Co. 

An organ exists which plays in color instead of in tone 
and pitch. Its invention was a recognition of the synes- 
thetic power which every artist to some extent possesses 
— the power to translate images received through one 
sense into terms of another sense. 

If one could carry the principle of synesthesia invent- 
ively several steps farther than the color organ, and pro- 
duce a device that would interpret sound in terms of 
fragrance, and color in terms of odor, and so on, one would 
have something very like Iris Tree's book. It is, to quote 
her own words, "a kaleidoscope of roaring color," using 
the word "color" itself in a rather synesthetic sense. Such 
figures as "scarlet rhapsodies and beryl-cold sonatas," 
"The pale smell of their falling blossoms," and "Its scent 
is sweeter than ghostly music," are characteristic. 

Rebecca West, I believe, once referred to the works of 

Compton Mackenzie as not precisely novels but brilliantly 

colored cushions. I have somewhat the same feeling 

about Iris Tree's volume — it does not seem exactly a book. 

It is not a cushion; sometimes it seems a tapestry, at 

other times a bouquet of highly perfumed flowers, and 

still again a series of ariettes. This is nothing agunst it; 

anybody can make a book that seems like a book, but 

few can make a book that seems like — well, perhaps "a 

kaleidoscope" is the most inclusive term. The author, 

in her own words, opens wide 

the violet-petalled doon 
Of every shy and cloistered sense 
That all the scent and munc of the world 
May rush into the soul. 

The poems are dazzling, arresting, with imagery now 

a bit Keatsian in suggestion, but more often altogether 

modern. Verses like these represent the author's method: 

Moonlit lilacs under the window, 

And the pale smell of their falling blossoms, 

And the white floating beams like luminous moths 

Fluttering from bloom to bloom. 

Sprays of lilac flowers 

Frothing at the green verge of midnight waves. 

Frozen to motionless icicles. 

Moonlight flows over me, 

Full of illicit, marvebus perfumes 

Wreathed with syringa and plaited with hyacinths; 

Hair of the moonlight falling about me, 

Straight and cool as the drooping tresses of rain. 

The spiritual interpretations which the author makes 
are as unvivid as her imagery is vivid. Neither "the dim 

[i66] 



 



Color Sonatas 

psychic crystals*' of her soul nor her wish that she were 
'"God in a colored globe" moves one to more than casual 
interest. Perhaps this is partly because one looks for 
sensuous instead of spiritual beauties in a kaleidoscope. 
Illustrations and decorations usually spoil a book of 
poems. In this case the decorations, done by Curtis 
MofFatt, the author's husband, have the same quality as 
the verses and add to their flavor.

THE PREMATUHmr OF IMMATURITY 

Hidden Path, by Ned Hungerford. Privately printed. 

It is hard to call this the poetry of a young man. There 
is feeling and experience in it; it is immature not in knowl- 
edge of life but in the mechanics of expression, in the 
practice of poetic craftsmanship. Where other poets can 
amble and even trip gaily and gracefully, in well trodden 
and frequented ways, Mr. Hungerford plods lonely and 
stumbling. He presents almost pathetically the figure 
of a man desperately concerned with self-expression, not 
as a necessity born with him but out of some troubling 
circumstance. I feel that things are maddeningly dull 
for Mr. Hungerford, wherever he is; that he has an insup- 
pressible desire to find a kinder environment. 

That is why opening his book gave me the thrill that a 
man might feel if he picked up a stray message from a lost 
man — say, something in a bottle, or between the halves 
of a fruit. There is a distracting personal interest in 

every poem that makes its status as poetry unimportant. 
And the regrettable element in the matter is that the 
author deliberately aims to achieve this effect. He writes 
in lys introductory poem: 

Reader . . 

That these poems are now in your hands 

Is proof that they are meant for you. 

Whatever your race, color, or creed, you are brother 

To him who wrote them. 

And to him who placed them in your hands. 

It is the old plea of the beginner not sure of his audience, 
the old futile defiance of criticism, futile because of its un- 
conscious confession of a lack of technique. Somewhere 
else in the book, he makes the stock challenge: 

O ready condemners, 

Isn 't it just possible 

You and I are thinking of something 

Entirely different? 

The persistent illusion of being misunderstood (when 
one is merely ignored), the illusion that others in his plight 
may take heart fromhisavowals,istheinspirationof a good 
many of these poems. Throughout, the reader is left with 
the consciousness of listening to a muddled eager man, 
who can hardly resist the temptation to buttonhole his 
few auditors. The very titles of this and a previous book 
— Hidden Pathy Uncertain Trail — give Mr. Hungerford's 
own estimate of his literary journey. 

If Ned Hungerford is comparatively young, he may 
find out eventually whither he is bound, in which case he

will regret publishing this misgiven itinerary. If he is 
not a young man and is bogged fast in bewildering cross- 
roadSy the book will be one more of the crowded minor 
fatalities on the literary front. From any standpoint it 
is premature; it may have satisfied momentarily a crav- 
ing to appear in print, but already it must have obliterated 
that satisfaction by coming back in all its gruesome im- 
maturity to haunt its author. It would have been passed 
over in silence; but as it is typical of many books of verse 
sent out in quest of reviews, the above remarks may serve 
as a hint to other self-deceived, and often embittered, 
would-be poets. Isidor Schneider 



CORRESPONDENCE 

THE ALLIED ARTS AGAIN 
I 

Dear Editor: It was with great interest that I read 
in Poetry for October, your comments upon my Musical 
America article. I am glad to have the opportunity 
and the invitation to express an opinion I have long held. 

I believe we should have something in the nature of 
a National Committee for the Protection of the Native 
Lyric from the Distortions Practised by Incompetent 
Composers. Poets, when asked for permission to make 
'* settings" of their words, often grant it graciously and 
trust to luck. What a writer ought to do is to tell the 


composer to make a setting and submit it to him for 
approval. But as few poets are willing to profess expert- 
ness in musical judgments, the writer usually has to 
submit to whatever outrageous interpretation the com- 
poser may perpetrate. I see no reason why a poet should 
not say to a composer: "Yes, you may make a setting 
of my poem, provided that, before publishing it, you 
will submit it to a committee on which both poetry and 
music are represented." Such a committee would be a 
step toward establishing a standard, and perhaps it 
might do a great deal, in ways other than censorship, 
to stimulate the progress of American song. 

One other thing might be spoken of as a possible reason 
why there is not greater co-operation among poets and 
musicians: often of late the poet talks business and pro- 
poses a division of royalty, whereupon the negotiations 
are soon at an end. There are different reasons in 
different cases, but usually this happens because the 
composer knows, if he has ever published anything, that 
the royalty will be too small to divide — a fact which he 
dislikes to confess, even to a fellow-artist. And he does 
not want to be forced to keep books and mail out each 
month a cheque which would probably fluctuate between 
two dollars and six. If there is money in music-publish- 
ing, the music-publisher must get most of it. 

Referring again to your editorial, you express doubt 
whether I have taken the trouble to get acquainted 
with, or try to understand, contemporary poets. But 


The Allied Arts Again 

I can plead guilty only in part — I have not been able 
to keep pace with all our American poets, it is trae, but 
I have known some of them, and I am eager to meet 
others and try to understand their art. 

Instead of citing Carpenter's settings of the Tagore 
things in your editorial, you might more fitly have men- 
tioned his use of The Hearths Country ^ by Florence Wilkin- 
son; or the delightful song Henry Hadley made last 
year out of When I Go Away from You^ by Amy Lowell. 

Please let me say in conclusion that I never have said 
there were not fine American songs. But they are 
remarkably few, and remarkably hard to place effectively 
in a recital programme. Charles Albert Case

Dear Poetry: To all serious students of the dance, the 
first sentence in your October article, "Poetry would like 
to celebrate its ninth birthday by inaugurating a closer 
affiliation with the allied arts of music and the drama — 
perhaps also the dante^* is encouraging. That "perhaps" 
is deserved: only those who come in daily contact with 
the too-popular belief that the door to real achievement 
may be kicked open by a perfectly pointed toe, can 
realize how far the dance has traveled from its dignified 
origin. In alliance with that music and poetry to which 
the dance really gave birth lies her only hope. Music 
and poetry give the dancer a reason for existence. 

We had the pleasure of working with Alfred Kreymborg 
in the summer of 1920, and not only felt that we, as 
dancers, had profited, but we gained an insight into, and 
a feeling for, the rhythm of modern poetry that nothing 
but the actual bodily expression of it could have given us. 
We have been fortunate also in being associated with a 
musician who has used pieces of Sara Teasdale's, Vachel 
Lindsay's, Bliss Carman's, and other moderns, as themes 
for dance-music. 

Certainly poets, musicians and dancers need not fear 
to join forces. They have the fundamentals in common. 
With such different, yet harmonious, outward manifesta- 
tions of those fundamentals, surely the result will not be 
unworthy of poetry or music, and will surely be of infinite 
value to the dance in its reinstatement among the arts. 

We so often fail to say the pleasant things we think. 
Poetry is a monthly refreshment. It is like a breath 
from freshly opened flowers, or a drink of mountain water.

Note by the Editor: Another correspondent reminds us that Rupert 
Hughes, well known both as novelist and composer, has used a number 
of modem lyrics: for example, one of the editor's own, / Love my Ufe^ 
originally published in Poetry; and quite recently Evening in the West^ 
or better The Ivory Moment^ by John Drury, from the new Los Angeles 
monthly. The Lyric West, Schirmer & Co. are Mr. Hughes' publishers. 




NOTES 

Mr. Lew Sarett, of Chicago, or rather of her neighbor-city Evanston, 
has consented to act henceforth as a member of the Advisory Committee 
of Poetry. Mr. Sarett is the author of Many Many Moons; and the 
award of last month to his poem. The Box of God^ makes him the latest 
winner of the Helen Haire Levinson Prize. He has been, for the last 
year, in the Public Speaking Department of Northwestern University. 

In our advertising pages the Poetry Society of South Carolina makes 
an announcement of great interest to poets. A prize of I250, donated 
by W. Van R. Whitall, Esq., of Pelham, N. Y., is to be awarded an- 
nually, under the Society's auspices, for the best poem sent in competi- 
tion before Jan. ist of each year. Mr. Pelham makes sure of a com- 
petent choice this year by appointing Miss Amy Lowell to the honor 
of initiating the award by acting as the first judge. 

Louise Ayres Gamett (Mrs. Eugene H.), of Evanston, 111., wrote 
the poem Resurgam as the text of an oratorio for which Mr. Henry Had- 
ley is now composing the music. In our November Correspondence 
Mrs. Gamett told the story of this collaboration; and the complete work, 
which will soon be published, may be regarded as an essay in that 
closer alliance between poetry and music which the editor has pleaded 
for in recent numbers of Poetry. 

Mrs. Gamett has published, through Rand, McNally & Co., three 
books of verse for children; and she wrote both words and music of 
Creature Songs (Oliver Ditson Co.). The Macmillan Co. published 
her play Master fFill of Stratford^ and The Drama has printed two or 
three of her plays for children. 

Mr. Walter de la Mare, the well known English poet, is the author 
of numerous books of verse for adults and children; and his Collected 
Poems — igoi'igiS were published in a two-volume edition by Henry 
Holt & Co. in 1920. 

Mr. Fenton Johnson, of Chicago, who stands facile princeps among 
living poets of his race, is the author of three small privately printed 
books of verse, the latest being Songs of the Soil (1916). He foundied, 
and edited for some time The Champion^ a magazine for Negroes, and 
he has been on the staff of The Favorite Magazine, 

Mr. Emanuel Carnevali, of Chicago, has contributed verse and prose 
to most of the special magazines, but has not yet published a volume. 
In 191 8 he recdved a Young Poet's Prize from Pobtry. 

Miss Winifred Waldron, of North Glendale, Cal., has printed poems 
in various magazines. "Paul Tanaquil" is a pseudonym. 

Of the poets who have not hitherto appeared in Poetry: 

Miss Pearl Andelson, of Chicago, was until recently a member of the 
Poetry Club of the University of Chicago, which has been a good training- 
school for a number of young poets. 

Miss Dorothy Dow, of Winchester, lU., has published little as yet. 

Mr. Laurence Vail lives in New York. 

Ditto Mr. Henry Saul 2^1insky, who, although only seventeen, has 
already been newsboy, bell-boy, office-boy, electrician, shoe-salesman 
and ad-solicitor; and who hopes to become a student again some day 
and finish his interrupted course at college.

JANUARY 1922 



THE WITCH OF COOS 

Circa ig22 

I STAID the night for shelter at a farm 
Behind the mountain, with a mother and son, 
Two old-believers. They did all the talking. 

The Mother 
Folks think a witch who has familiar spirits 
She could call up to pass a winter evening. 
But wotCt^ should be burned at the stake or something. 
Summoning spirits isn't "Button, button. 
Who's got the button," you're to understand. 

The Son 
Mother can make a common table rear 
And kick with two legs like an army mule. 

The Mother 
And when I've done it, what good have I done? 
Rather than tip a table for you, let me 
Tell you what Ralle the Sioux Control once told me. 
He said the dead had souls, but when I asked him 
How that could be — I thought the dead were souls. 
He broke my trance. Don't that make you suspicious 
That there's something the dead are keeping back? 
Yes, there's something the dead are keeping back. 

The Son 
You wouldn't want to tell him what we have 
Up attic, mother? 

The Mother 

Bones — a skeleton. 

The Son 
But the headboard of mother's bed is pushed 
Against the attic door: the door is nailed. 
It's harmless. Mother hears it in the night 
Halting perplexed behind the barrier 
Of door and headboard. Where it wants to get 
Is back into the cellar where it came from. 

The Mother 
We'll never let them, will we, son? We'll never! 

The Son 
It left the cellar forty years ago 
And carried itself like a pile of dishes 
Up one flight from the cellar to the kitchen. 
Another from the kitchen to the bedroom, 


Robert Frost 

Another from the bedroom to the attic, 

Right past both father and mother, and neither stopped 

it. 
Father had gone upstairs; mother was downstairs. 
I was a baby: I don't know where I was. 
The Mother 
The only fault my husband found with me — 
I went to sleep before I went to bed, 
Especially in winter when the bed 
Might just as well be ice and the clothes snow. 
The night the bones came up the cellar-stairs 
Toffile had gone to bed alone and left me. 
But left an open door to cool the room off 
So as to sort of turn me out of it. 
I was just coming to myself enough 
To wonder where the cold was coming from. 
When I heard Toffile upstairs in the bedroom 
And thought I heard him downstairs in the cellar. 
The board we had laid down to walk dry-shod on 
When there was water in the cellar in spring 
Struck the hard cellar bottom. And then someone 
Began the stairs, two footsteps for each step. 
The way a man with one leg and a crutch. 
Or little child, comes up. It wasn't Toffile: 
It wasn't anyone who could be there. 
The bulkhead double-doors were double-locked 
And swollen tight and buried under snow. 
The cellar windows were banked up with sawdust 

U77^ 




 

And swollen tight and buried under snow. 

It was the bones. I knew them — and good reason. 

My first impulse was to get to the knob 

And hold the door. But the bones didn't try 

The door; they halted helpless on the landing, 

Waiting for things to happen in their favor. 

The faintest restless rustling ran all through them. 

I never could have done the thing I did 

If the wish hadn't been too strong in me 

To see how they were mounted for this walk. 

I had a vision of them put together 

Not like a man, but like a chandelier. 

So suddenly I flung the door wide on him. 

A moment he stood balancing with emotion, 

And all but lost himself. (A tongue of fire 

Flashed out and licked along his upper teeth. 

Smoke rolled inside the sockets of his eyes.) 

Then he came at me with one hand outstretched. 

The way he did in life once; but this time 

I struck the hand off brittle on the floor. 

And fell back from him on the floor myself. 

The finger-pieces slid in all directions. 

(Where did I see one of those pieces lately? 

Hand me ray button-box — it must be there.) 

I sat up on the floor and shouted, "Toflile, 
It's coming up to you." It had its choice 
Of the door to the cellar or the hall. 


Robert Frost 

It took the hall door for the novelty, 

And set off briskly for so slow a thing, 

Still going every which way in the joints, though. 

So that it looked like lightning or a scribble. 

From the slap I had just now given its hand. 

I listened till it almost climbed the stairs 

From the hall to the only finished bedroom, 

Before I .got up to do anything; 

Then ran and shouted, "Shut the bedroom door, 

Toffile, for my sake!" "Company," he said, 

"Don't make me get up; I'm too warm in bed." 

So lying forward weakly on the handrail 

I pushed myself upstairs, and in the light 

(The kitchen had been dark) I had to own 

I could see nothing. "Toffile, I don't see it. 

It's with us in the room, though. It's the bones." 

" What bones ? " " The cellar bones — out of the grave." 

That made him throw his bare legs out of bed 

And sit up by me and take hold of me. 

I wanted to put out the light and see 

If I could see it, or else mow the room. 

With our arms at the level of our knees. 

And bring the chalk-pile down. "I'll tell you what — 

It's looking for another door to try. 

The uncommonly deep snow has made him think 

Of his old song. The Wild Colonial Boy, 

He always used to sing along the tote-road. 


 



 J 



POETRY: A Magazine of Verse 

He's after an open door to get out-doors. 
Let's trap him with an open door up attic." 
Toffile agreed to that, and sure enough, 
Almost the moment he was given an opening, 
The steps began to climb the attic stairs. 
I heard them. Toffile didn't seem to hear them. 
"Quick!" I slammed to the door and held the knob. 
"Toffile, get nails." I made him nail the door shut. 
And push the headboard of the bed against it. 

Then we asked was there anything 

Up attic that we'd ever want again. 

The attic was less to us than the cellar. 

If the bones liked the attic, let them like it. 

Let them stay in the attic. When they sometimes 

Come down the stairs at night and stand perplexed 

Behind the door and headboard of the bed. 

Brushing their chalky skull with chalky fingers. 

With sounds like the dry rattling of ^ shutter. 

That's what I sit up in the dark to say — 

To no one any more since Toffile died. 

Let them stay in the attic since they went there. 

I promised Toffile to be cruel to them 

For helping them be cruel once to him. 

The Son 
We think they had a grave down in the cellar. 

The Mother 
We know they had a grave down in the cellar. 

[i8o] 



 



Robert Frost 

The Son 

We never could find out whose bones they were. 
The Mother 

Yes, we could too, son. Tell the truth for once. 

They were a man's his fa,ther killed for me. 

I mean a man he killed instead of me. 

The least I could do was help dig their grave. 

We were about it one night in the ce'lar. 

Son knows the story: but 'twas not for him 

To tell the truth, suppose the time had come. 

Son looks surprised to see me end a lie 

We'd kept up all these years between ourselves 

So as to have it ready for outsiders. 

But tonight I don't care enough to lie — 

I don't remember why I ever cared. 

Toffile, if he were here, I don't believe 

Could tell you why he ever cared himself. . . . 

She hadn't found the finger-bone she wanted 
Among the buttons poured out in her lap. 

I verified the name next morning: Toffile. 
The rural letter-box said Toffile Barre. 

Robert Frost

SONGS OF NIGHT 

ODE TO MYSELF TRYING TO SLEEP 

Draw in the threads of thought — 

Each delicate filament^ 

Reaching into too many places, 

Finding forgotten faces . . . 

Draw in the long twisting thoughts you have sent. 

Strange, that you lie here wondering 

About things that don't matter; 

Strange, that you lie here pondering . . . 

And outside, the raindrops patter, 

A fog is on the town, 

And over the river 

The drenched lights cross and quiver. 

And the far harsh rumble of trams goes up and down. 

Once, like a wind, beauty swept through you; 

Once, like a small song that sings and sings. 

Happiness crept through you; 

Once, love seemed the reason for things; 

And once you thought 

Peace had come upon you . . . 

And then all came to naught. 

Draw in the threads of thought — 
Each delicate filament, 


Marjorie Meeker 

Quivering and bright; 

Draw in the long twisting thoughts you have sent. 

Cast all the tangled old dreaming and groping 

To the still, deep, 

Strange heart of Night 

(Gentle forever to all grieving and hoping) — 

And sleep. 

IN DARKNESS 

Deep in the heart of darkness I am lying, 

Alone and still; 
And all the winds of darkness and of silence 

Work their will. 

Blowing about me through the awful spaces 

Of night and death; 
Nor all immensity can touch or thrill me 

To thought or breath. 

Deep in the heart of darkness I am dreaming, 

Quiet, alone. 
Careless alike of tender words or cruel — 

Even your own. 

BY A WINDOW 

The owl and the bat 
Are alone in the night — 

What arc they at 

By the dead moon's light? 
Hush! How the wings of the black bat whir! 
(Oh hush, for the sleepers moan and stir!) 

The moon is bleak, 

Like a monk in a cowl . . • 
What do they seek. 

The bat and the owl? 
What danger brews in the night, what sin? 
(But hush, for the sleepers dream within.) 



SONG FOR A MAY NIGHT 

Heigho! 

Many mysterious things I know! 

I know why the moon is like a moth — 

Do you? 
I know why stars are many, and suns 

Are few. 
I know a place where a star fell down. 
And made a hole in the middle of town. 
And all the people jumped in. And so — 

Heigho! 

Other mysterious things I know! 


Marjorie Meeker 



COLOR OF WATER 



You will be the color of water; 

Your voice will be like the wind; 
You will go where the dust goes; 

None will know you have sinned. 

None will know you are quiet, 
Or fluent, or bound, or free; 

None will care you are nothing; 
You will be nothing to me. 

Except a scarlet remembrance . . . 

As if, in a dream of pride, 
A poppy had flaunted her petals 

One day to the sun, and died. 



LONELY SKY AND SEA 

O lonely, lonely sky and sea — 

Where time is a wind that plays between. 
Blowing the colored centuries by. 

Tiny tragedies, quaint and mean — 

Why are you waiting? What have you heard? 

What majestic thing have you known. 
That you watch each other, listening. 

So long, so long alone? 

COMRADES 

Time sweq>s through me like a wind; 

Space engulfs me like a sea. 
Time and Space are at me always — 

They will not let me be. 

I am weary, weary with years, 

Troubled by immensity. 
With eternities around me. 

How can I be free? 



Marjorie Meeker 



FIRST SNOW 



The night was hiding a secret 

When it stole 

Through the red gates of sunset, 

Coming so silently. 

We heard it whispering 

To the bare trees. 

And while we wondered, 

The white souls of the autumn leaves 

Came softly back. 

Drifting, drifting.

SONGS OF THE PLAINS 



There's no hiding here in the glare of the desert- 
If your coat is sham the sun shines through. 

Here with the lonely things and the silence 
There is no crowd for saving you. 

When hearts love here the love lasts longer, 
And hate leaves here a heavy scar. 

But we, with the desert's beauty of distance. 
Are always dreaming of places far! 

If you have come to start a kingdom — 
Our eyes have looked on Rome and Tyre! 

But if you come with dreams for baggage, 
Sit with us by the cedar fire! 

II 

The sultry sudden darkness, 

Like some black mantle thrown 
From shoulders of a giant 

On children left alone, 
Falls over us; and, stilled with fear. 
In dark we see, in silence hear! 

Then rain! — a sudden pounding 
Of unformed maddened things, 

Pounding, splashing — stubborn 

As vultures' heavy wings 
That pound the air, too sure to hate, 
In hunger, and move low, and wait! 

I 
III I 

Four old trees stand tall on a hill. 

Wind swirls around them, never still; i 

And their heads together bow and sway ! 

As if in talk of a game they play. j 

Sometimes they laugh and sometimes sigh; 

And there beneath a low gray sky 

I've seen them drop their leaves when thins 

The gold and crimson, as near dawn 

Wise gamblers drop their cards upon 

The table, saying kindly, "Why 

Quarrel with a game that no one wins!" 



IV 

The wood was so old that I thought 

I'd hear it saying its prayers 
In the aisles like cloisters wrought; 

But I came on it, unawares, 
Chuckling — like old men mellow grown — 



Talking of youth on a hill alone 
[i88] 



 



Glenn Ward Dresbach 



The birds love you too. 

Calling, "Sweet, sweet, sweet!' 
In the windy lane 

Where the tree-tops meet. 

But I love you best. 

Since my lips let pass 
No song lest I miss 

Your steps on the grass. 



VI 

ril go where willows quicken 

Their dances in the glow 
Of morning, and the wild brooks 

Make music down below; 
For I am weary seeking 

The things I may not know. 

And I shall feel the silver 

Of willow leaves, and hold 
A drop of water winking 

With rainbows yet unsold. 
What more may all the world find 

Now all its dreams are old!

TWO POEMS 

I SHALL REMEMBER 

Open to me the door of heaven 

For an hour, an hour! 
Let me pace the floor of heaven. 

Let me pluck one .flower! 

Forever and forever heaven 

Will live upon my lips. 
I shall remember. Never heaven 

Shall fail my seeking ships. 

I shall be shod and swathed with heaven— 

Ah, the blue filmy veil — 
Because for an hour I bathed in heaven 

Whose winds hurt and heal. 

I shall remember. Songs of heaven, 

I shall sing them still; 
Like the silver throngs of heaven 

I shall have heaven's will. 

So open to me the door of heaven 

For an hour, an hour! 
Let me breathe the air of heaven. 

Let me pluck one flower! 


Grace Fallow Norton 

SHY PERFECT FLOWER 

Shy perfect pearl-white flower, blooming alone 

In northern woods where snow has sown 

Its myriad seed — ^shy perfect flower, 

Fragrant, alone — 

Your dark leaves cluster close to hide you the more. 

I part them and remember bright poppies on the plain. 

They run in the wind, a ragged gypsy train; 

They fling themselves at the feet of the golden grain — 

When it is slain they too are slain. 

Their life is a cry! Their life is a sudden scarlet stain! 

Their dream-dark seeds have fearful power. 

And you, shy perfect pearl-white flower? 

Grace Fallow Norton 



TO SAPPHO 

Torn fragments of your woven words I read; 
And less their throbbing cry has power to stir 
My passion than to soothe me to strange peace. 
Remembering the long silence fallen on you. 

Julia R. Reynolds 

IRISH SONG 

Where the highway steps along 

(In Donegal, in Donegal!) 

I gave my feet the choice o* way, wherever they would 

roam. 
They might have marched to Londonderry, Belfast, 

Dublin ... 
The foolish, eager feet o' me, they marched straight home! 

The little gown o' blue you wore 

(In Donegal, in Donegal!) 

Cried out to me, Come in! Come in! Your apron it said. 

Stay! 
The tying o* the plaid shawl across the warm heart o' you 
Tied in-along the heart o' me — I couldn't get away. 

I took off my wander-shoes, 

(In Donegal, in Donegal!) 

The highway stepped along alone, until it slipped from 

view. 
I laid aside my dusty dreams, hung up my ragged lifetime. 
And rested feet and heart o' me before the sight o* you ! 

Helen Coale Crew 




ON THE WING 

A wind that blows from the sea^ and smells 

Of spring and fall together. 
Runs racing up the yellow fields 

Into the autumn weather* 

And I run too, for I am young 

And breathless with all living — 
The trees are shouting as we pass. 

The asters singing in the grass. 

In half an hundred years from now. 

When all my songs are sung, 
rU not be old and crossly sage, 
I'll love the bright hill of my age 

Under its winter sun. 
And wave the gayest hand I know 

To everything that's young. 

Dorothy Keeley 


POUR POEMS 

I ASK FOR A FRIBND 

I ask a girly for a friend — a playmate 

Full of May-blown dreams; and lilac in her hair; 

With boyish ankles, intimately strange 

And hands forever busy with applause; 

And mothering, lash-screened, virgin eyes; 

And a slim-breasted body made of joy. 

Her coming would mean spring to my heart; 
We'd give our souls a holiday, cut loose, 
Arrange a rendezvous with Love somewhere — 
And forget to keep it, being good friends. 

I ask a girl, for a friend — a playmate 

Full of May-blown dreams; and lilac in her hair. 

SONNET 

When Love unveiled her body to my sight 
And in my heart a strange unquiet grew, 
As soft winds stir the bosom of the night 
And, after, spill their tears as drops of dew — 
When first Love laid aside her woven dress 
Of silken-tissued dreams and scented stuff, 
And fastened my young eyes with loveliness 
Until I thought one world was scarce enough 
To hold such utter happiness and pain — 


Ernest Walsh 

I begged the god of love to strike me blind, 
And seal Love's image up within my brain, 
Queen of my thoughts the kingdom of my Mind! 
But when I took Love's body to my breast. 
Her lips were bitter, and her face a jest* 

THE FICKLE LOVER 

I have made Life my mistress; built temples 
Of song to her in my heart; paraded 
Before her enemy, Death. And smiling, 
Have kissed Life before Death's envious eyes; 
Proud in my lust, gay in my strength, love-wise. 

But often in my dreams I've wished to touch 
The cool sophisticated lips of Death. 

COLLAPSE 

As an old tree bent by ages of winds. 
So I am tired; 

As an oak-leaf blown out upon the sea, 
I am lonely; 

As a storm-conceived adventurous wave 

Divides before its thousand lonely deaths 

On alien shores. 

My life shall end. 

Ernest Walsh

TABLEAUX 

SCHERZO 

My soul is a danccr-r 

A dancer under shimmering willows in the sunlight. 

The wind draws a bow across his violin. 

He plays a scherzo — 

Rippling notes on strings of silver. 

Play faster, wind! 

My feet are more swift than the leaves of the willow- 
Shimmering, shimmering — 
Amber shadows in the sunlight. 
My feet arc more swift than the laughter of waters: 
Play faster, wind! 

TRYST 

I will wear my gown of dusk-blue silk. 

And in my hair 

A crescent moon, curved like a petal. 

From the rim of the shadowy pool 
I will pluck an iris — 
Dusk-blue, shading to purple. 
Faint-scented as the breath of sandalwood. 

Softly 

I will come through the drooping willows. 


Ellen Margaret Janson 

The leaves will catch at my gown. 

Dusk-blue 

In the purple shadows. 

The grasses will whisper, sighing, 

As if they knew. 

Down at the wall 

I will wait alone in the darkness; 

And close my eyes. 

Dreaming that I hear your voice. 

INCENSE SMOKE 

One stick I lit in the bronzen image. 

The smoke curls upward — ^lazily — between his lips; 

Ivory, and the frail blue of shadows. 

The image is speaking — 

Words of lazy dream-blue smoke 

Carved like ivory: 

"Do you remember? — 

The priests wore dragons, great jeweled dragons on their 

robes. 
They sang dreamily 
To the god of the dim temple — 
Chanting, chanting 

Through the twisted smoke of incense. 
But the god did not stir. 
His eyes were like opals, veiled with lost mystery!" 

The smoke curls upward — drowsily — 

Between his lips; 

Mist-gray, and the amber of shadows. 

The image is speaking. 

Words of dim gray-gold smoke 

Graven like amber: 

"Do you remember 

The offering you burned alone at dawn 

To one who did not answer? 

Across the ashes 

You saw the sea-mist rising — rising — 

Like the smoke of incense^ 

And cried out with the pain in your heart." 

The smoke curls upward — dreamily — 

Between his lips; 

Ivory, and the lost blue of shadows. 

NIGHT IN THE CITY 

I hear them pass by the wall of my garden — 

The swift whisper of silk, 

And laughter — 

Tinkling like the wind-bells on the shadowy terrace, 

Tinkling and calling. ^ 

Their lanterns form a necklace 
Of gems, 


Ellen Margaret Janson 

Low-strung across the dusk. 

Their laughter dies away past the wall of my garden. 

In the willow 

The echo lingers — 

The echo of laughter, failing 

Into sudden weariness. 

THE UNKNOWN 

I am the stir of garments that you heard 

Pass by you in the wood. 
I am the lips that smile, but speak no word 

For evil or for good. 

I am the voice that whispered in the long 

Sweet twilights of the spring. 
I am the haunting music of the song 

I would not let you sing. 

I am the finger beckoning in the street; 

The strife, and the reward; 
The quivering joy that stabbed you with its sweet 

Sharper than any sword. 

I am the dream that shines — a light apart, 

When other lights are spent. 
I am the pain that grips and breaks your heart 

To save it from content! 

Ellen Margaret Janson 
POEMS 

WILD ORCHARD 

It is a broken country, 
the rugged land is 
green from end to end; 
the autumn has not come. 

Embanked above the orchard 
the hillside is a wall 
of motionless green trees, 
the grass is green and red. 

Five days the bare sky 
has stood there day and night. 
No bird, no sound. 
Between the trees 

stillness 

and the early morning light. 

The apple trees 

are laden down with fruit. 

Among blue leaves 
the apples green and red 
upon one tree stand out 
most enshrined. 

Still, ripe, heavy, 
spherical and close, 


fVilliam Carlos Williams 



they mark the hillside. 
It is a formal grandeur, 

a stateliness, 
a signal of finality 
and perfect ease. 
Among the savage 

aristocracy of rocks 
one, risen as a tree, 
has turned 
from his repose. 

THE LONELY STREET 

School is over. It is too hot 

to walk at ease. At ease 

in light frocks they walk the streets 

to while the time away. 

They have grown tall. They hold 

pink flames in their right hands. 

In white from head to foot, 

with sidelong, idle look — 

in yellow, floating stuff, 

black sash and stockings — 

touching their avid mouths 

with pink sugar on a stick — 

like a carnation each holds in her hand- 

they mount the lonely street. 

[20l] 




 

SPOUTS 

In this world of 

as fine a pair of breasts 

as ever I saw, 

the fountain in 

Madison Square 

spouts up of water 

a white tree, 

that dies and lives 

as the rocking water 

in the basin 

turns from the stone rim 

back upon the jet 

and rising there 

reflectively drops down again. 

THE widow's lament IN SPRINGTIME 

Sorrow is my own yard 

where the new grass 

flames as it has flamed 

often before, but not 

with the cold fire 

that closes round me this year. 

Thirty-five years 

I lived with my husband. 


fVilliam Carlos WiUiams 

The plum tree is white today 

with masses of flowers. 

Masses of flowers 

load the cherry branches 

and color some bushes 

yellow and some red, 

but the grief in my heart 

is stronger than they, 

for though they were my joy 

formerly, today I notice them 

and turn away forgetting. 

Today my son told me 

that in the meadows, 

at the edge of the heavy woods 

in the distance, he saw 

trees of white flowers. 

I feel that I would like 

to go there 

and fall into those flowers 

and sink into the marsh near them.

COMMENT 



THE HOPE OF PEACE 

ALL the movements of the day — all the isms and 
schools and drives — fade into insignificance compared 
with the movement to get rid of war. This movement is 
not out of place in these pages — in fact, it is immediately 
the poet's business. 

I am tempted to repeat now an editorial from Poetry 
for September, 1914. In the first white heat of those 
terrible first battles, I wrote this page on The Poetry of 
War: 

Poets have made more wan than kings, and war wiU not cease until 
they remove its glamour from the imaginations of men. 

What is the fundamental, the essential and psychological cause of 
war? The feeling in men's hearts that it is beautiful. And who have 
created this feeling? Partly, it is true, kings and their ''armies with 
banners'*; but, far more, poets with their war-songs and epics, sculptors 
with thdr statues — the assembled arts which have taken their orders 
from kings, their inspiration from battles. Kings and artists have 
united to give to war its glamour, to transmute into sounds and colors 
and forms of beauty its savagery and horror, to give heroic appeal to 
its unreason, a heroic excuse to its rage and lust. 

All this is of the past. The race is beginning to suspect those old 
ideals, to give valor a wider range than war affords, to seek danger not 
at the cannon's mouth but in less noisy labors and adventures. When 
Nicholas of Russia and William of Germany, in solemn state the other 
day, invoked the blessing of God upon their armies, the emotion that 
went round the world was not the old thrill, but a new sardonic laughter. 

As Cervantes smiled Spain's chivalry away, so some poet of the new 
era may strip the glamour from war. Tobtoi's War and Peace and many 
lesser books are chapters of the new revelation, and modern science. 




The Hope of Peace 

modern invention, have aided the race in its half-conscious efibrt to 
unveil the bitter hideousness of the war-god's visage. But the final 
word has not been said; the feeling that war is beautiful still lingers in 
men's hearts, a feeling founded on world-old savageries — ^love of power, 
of torture, of murder, love of big stakes in a big game. This feeling must 
be destroyed, as it was created, through the imagination. It is work for 
a poet. 

There will be a new poetry of war. 

The time for that poetry is now. It must be written in 
peace, for when war begins there is nothing to do but 
fight. War is no more inevitable between nations than 
between individuals: as duelling was outlawed long ago in 
all civilized states, and its elaborate and long-accepted 
code of honor relegated to the scrap-heap, so shall war be 
outlawed by the assembled nations of the world, and its 
elaborate and long-accepted code of international law 
become a difsty byword of history. War is an absurd 
anachronism in this closely connected talking and trading 
world; and modern science has made it an anachronism 
poisonous and murderous beyond the maddest dreams of 
the darkest devils of hell. It must end if the white race 
is to preserve its numbers, its supremacy, its creative 
energy and power, and the proud fabrics of its civilization. 

We face a war to the death on war, and none can afford 
to be a slacker in it. In this ultimate war the deadliest 
weapon is the germ of thought in human brains. Only 
the poet can spawn that germ, and send it flying forth 
by invisible millions to mature in the minds of men. 
Cervantes wrote Don ^ixote^ and suddenly a rotten 

things long ready for death, was dead. Let some poet — 
or perhaps a number of poets in a number of arts — stab 
with laughter or scorch with tears the rotten hulk of war, 
and suddenly the world will know that war is dead. 

H.M. 

. MUST ART BE INTERESTING? 

Implicitly all interesting things have beauty, and the 
most interested person is no doubt the most esthetic. 
Such a thesis is not hard to support on the ground that 
interest can relate only to things of immediate worth and 
beauty. But to travel from this rather nervous doctrine 
of values to the position that beauty is determined by the 
interest it arouses is another and more complex matter. 
Though Ford Madox Hueffer in his recent Thus to Revisit 
reiterates charmingly, and with convincing disregard for 
the logical responsibilities of his theme, that art must be 
interesting, the shadow of an unsolved problem rather 
obscures the result. He rests his proposition, it is true, 
on human impulse, not on philosophical consideration; 
but the question is not easily confined. In that spec- 
ulative periphery of art where beauty dissolves into 
metaphysics no problem is more persistent. 

As a weapon against the absolutism in art which makes 
no compromise with the public taste the book will be 
effective. It undermines this stern and puritan dogma 
with the suggestion that final values in art as well as in 
other fields of human experience lie after all. in human 


Must Art be Interesting? 

nature itself. It abandons the rigorous heaven reserved 
by the absolutists for the saved few, and returns frankly 
to popular interest for its standard. To their ascetic 
practice in casting oflF mundane and popular interests it 
can oppose the Protagorean formula, "Man is the measure 
of all things." But in liberating art from these mbralisms 
Mr. Huefier imposes another moralism in his repeated 
dictum, "Art must be interesting." Why after all must 
these highly complex things, art and interest, always be 
associated? That interesting things, as a matter of 
descriptive fact, are in a measure beautiful does not imply 
that art, as a matter of moral or artistic imperative, must 
be interesting. Mr. HueflFer rather increases than dimin- 
ishes the speculative difficulties and enticements of the 
problem. 

Overburdened beauty carries many theories on its back. 
All of them, from absolutist to pragmatist, aim in some 
way to find a functional value of beauty in the social 
system. The mere act of erecting a rational theory about 
it indicates an effort to organize beauty into a system of 
human relationships. There remains to remark, no doubt, 
that beauty is not a theory, that it is not subject to 
theorizing, that it needs and possesses no justification in 
the social order. But that too in its way is incorrect. In 
this field -rich with questions Mr. HuefFer's interesting 
book quite appropriately asks what it cannot answer.

REVIEWS 

A SYMPOSIUM ON MARIANNE MOORE 

PoemSy by Marianne Moore. Egoist Press, London. 

Such contrary opinions of this provocative little pam- 
phlet have reached us that perhaps the most suggestive 
review will be a more or less questioning rehearsal of 
them. Miss Moore's steely and recondite art has long 
been a rallying-point for the radicals. Although her first 
appearance was in Poetry — in May, 191 5, most of the 
entries in these twenty-four closely printed pages date 
from Others and The Egoist^ a few from The Dial and 
Contact. Rumor has hinted that the selection and publica- 
tion were made by certain friends of the author without 
her knowledge. 

If one were to accept the challenge of the title, and of 
the geometrical verse-designs which frame these cryptic 
observations, one might be led straight to the ancient and 
rather futile inquiry. What is poetry? Poetry is evidently 
a matter of individual definition. H. D., surely a critic 
of authority, calls Miss Moore a poet, and a number of 
young radicals are eager to pronounce her "a very great 
poet," as Yvor Winters did in a recent letter. "With the 
exception of Wallace Stevens," he wrote, "she is about 
the only person since Rimbaud who has had any very 
profound or intricate knowledge and command of sound; 
and I am not sure but I think her about the best poet in 
this country except for Mr. Stevens." 


A Symposium on Matianne Moore 

A more moderate admirer, Miss Winifred Bryher, sends 
us the following estimate from England: 

This volume is the study of a Marco Polo detained at home. It is 
the fretting of a wish against wish until the self b drawn, not into a 
world of air and adventure, but into a narrower self, patient, dutiful and 
precise. Those Various Scalpels is sharper than a diamond. It b as 
brilliant a poem as any written of late years, and yet it is but a play 
with the outside of substances and the inside of thoughts too tired to 
feel emotion. And Dock Rats again, or England^ are wrought as finely as 
the old Egyptians wrought figures from an inch-high piece of emerald; 
but they lack the one experience of life for which life was created. 

The temperament behind the words b not a passive one, however 
much environment may have forced meditation upon it as a form of 
"protective coloration." The spirit is robust, that of a man with facts 
and countries to discover and not that of a woman sewing at tapestries. 
But something has come between the free spirit and its desire — a 
psychological uneasiness that b expressed in these few perfect but static 
studies of a highly evolved intellect. 

Technically it is a triumphant book. There are scenes which are a 
joy to remember; the shifting color of 

wade 

through black jade 

of the crow-blue mussel shells — 

And the vivid beauty of The Talisman: 

Under a splintered mast, 
torn from ship and cast 
near her hull, 

a stumbling shepherd found 
embedded in the ground, 
a sea-gull 

of lapis lazuli, 

a scarab of the sea, 

with wings spread — 

curling its coral feet, 
parting its beak to greet 
men long dead. 

Miss Moore has preferred, to date, to express simply the pictorial 
aspect of the universe, and she has fulfilled perfectly each self-imposed 
task. Her Poems are an important addition to American literature, to 
the entire literature of the modern world. Only, Marco Polo, your 
sword is ready and your kingdoms wait. May it soon please you to 
leave the fireside and ride forth. 

But Miss Moore's admirers don't have it all their own 
way. Here is the point of view of one of Poetry's 
associate editors, Marion Strobel: 

Even a gymnast should have grace. If we find ourselves one of an 
audience in a side-show we prefer to see the well-muscled lady in tights 
stand on her head smilingly, with a certain nonchalance, rather than 
grit her teeth, perspire, and make us conscious of her neck muscles. 
Still, we would rather not see her at all. 

Just so we would rather not follow the contortions of Miss Moore's 
well-developed mind — she makes us so conscious of her knowledge! 
And because we are conscious that she has brains, that she is exceedingly 
well-informed, we are the more irritated that she has not learned to 
write with simplicity. 

The subject-matter of her poems is inevitably dry; the manner of 
expression pedantic. She shouts at our stupidity: "Literature is a 
phase of life;" "Words are constructive when they are true — the opaque 
allusion, the simulated flight upward, accomplishes nothing." And we 
yawn back at Miss Moore's omniscience. 

And another poet-critic, Pearl Andelson, says: 

Marianne Moore has much the Emily Dickinson type of mind, but 
where Emily Dickinson's not infrequent obscurities arise out of an 
authentic mysticism, Marianne Moore's are more likely the result of a 
relentless discipline in the subtler "ologies" and "osophies." She is 
brilliant at times to the point of gaudiness, although one feels that in 


A Symposium on Marianne Moore 

her brilliance she is most herself. As to form, the fact that she wavers 
between prose and poetry is not dis^ised by the breath-taking line- 
formation. Indeed, I should say the incongruous effect was heightened, 
rather than diminished, by occasional rhyming. The same, for the 
most part, may be said of content as of form. Such poems as Picking 
and Choosing and Poetry are hybrids of a flagrantly prose origin. 

Well, let us turn to the book — without prejudice one 
way or the other. In the first place, the lady is delight- 
fully independent; she says in Black Earth: 

Openly, yes, 

with the naturalness 

of the hippopotamus or the alligator 

when it climbs out on the bank to experience the 

sun, I do these 

things which I do, which please 

no one but myself. Now I breathe and now I am sub- 
merged; the blemishes stand up and shout when the object 

in view was a 

renaissance; shall I say 

the contrary? The sediment of the river which 
encrusts my joints makes me very gray, but I am used 

to it, it may 

remain there; do away 

with it and I am myself done away with, for the 
patina of circumstance can but enrich what was 

there to begin 

with. This elephant skin 

which I inhabit, fibred over like the shell of 

the cocoanut, this piece of black glass through which no light 

can filter — cut

And so on for about forty more lines, which develop and 
elaborate the elephantine symbol, and then drop it, as it 
were, in mid-career, with a quizzical trunk-flourish. As 
Black Earth is admirably representative of its author's 
thought and style, it may serve as the text for a few 
inquiries. 

Meditative self-confession is no novelty in English 
poetry — we have countless examples in as many difl^erent 
patterns. Hamlet's soliloquies, Gray's Elegy y Pope's Essay 
on Many Byron's Childe Harold^ Whitman's Song of 
Myself y many sonnets by Milton, Wordsworth, Keats and 
other supreme sonneteers — these arc but a few of the 
numerous high precedents in English poetry for more or 
less imaginative and more or less metrical meditation. 
And one may not deny imaginative power to the mind 
which can create and round out and energize so effectively 
the grotesque image which appears when she holds up the 
mirror to her soul. Neither may one refuse any poet the 
right to attempt new metrical patterns; since only through 
such attempts does any achievement become possible — 
any enrichment of the English prosodic scheme. 

So it remains to attempt to estimate the validity of 
Miss Moore's processes and the degree of her achievement. 


A Symposium on Marianne Moore 

Unquestionably there is a poet within the hard, deliber- 
ately patterned crust of such soliloquies as Black Earthy 
Those Various Scalpels^ Pedantic Literalisty Reinforce- 
ments — almost any of these titles — though a poet too 
sternly controlled by a stiffly geometrical intellectuality. 
Miss Moore is in terror of her Pegasus; she knows of what 
sentimental excesses that unruly steed is capable, and so 
her ironic mind harnesses down his wings and her iron 
hand holds a stiff rein. This mood yields prose oftener 
than poetry, but it wrings out now and then the reluctant 
beauty of a grotesque, or even, more rarely, such a lyric 
as Talisman. 

No amount of line-patterning can make anything but 
statement and argument out of many of the entries in this 
book — for example. Picking and Choosing^ which begins: 

Literature is a phase of life: if 

one is afraid of it, the situation b irremediable; if 
one approaches it familiarly, 

what one says of it b worthless. Words are constructive 
when they are true; the opaque illusion — the simulated flight 

upward — accomplishes nothing. Why cloud the fact 

that Shaw is self-consciots in the field of sentiment but is otherwise re- 
warding? that James b all that has been 

said of him but b not profound? It is not Hardy 
the dbtingubhed novelist and Hardy the poet, but one man 

"interpreting life through the medium of the 
emotions." 

if the mood instinctively flouts the muse, what of the 
•method? If the mood may rarely yield more than the 

hard reluctant beauty of a grotesque, is the method 
inevitable and right, fitting words musically, magically to 
the motive, as in all the masterpieces of the art? Well, let 
me confess that I do not find the divine shapeliness and 
sound-richness which Mr. Winters referred to in his 
letter. What I do find in certain poems is a brilliant array 
of subtly discordant harmonies not unlike those of certain 
ultra-modern composers, set forth in stanza-forms purely 
empirical even when emphasized by rhyme, forms which 
impose themselves arbitrarily upon word-structure and 
sentence-structure instead of accepting happily the 
limitations of the art's materials, as all art must. When 
Miss Moore uses the first syllable of accident as a whole 
line to rhyme with lack^ or the article ^ as a line to rhyme 
with the end of Persia; when she ends a stanza in a split 
infinitive, or in the middle of the swift word very — indeed, 
anywhere in the middle of words or sentences, she is 
forcing her pattern upon materials which naturally reject 
it, she is giving a wry twist even though her aim is a 
grotesque; and when her aim is more serious, such verbal 
whimsicalities strike at once the iiuensely false note of 
affectation. And as she takes her own way in these 
details of style, so she gives little heed to the more general 
laws of shapeliness; each poem begins as it ends and ends 
as it begins — a coruscating succession of ideas, with little 
curve of growth or climax. 

What I do find throughout this book is wit — wit 
fundamental and instinctive which expresses itself not 


A Symposium on Marianne Moore 

only in words, phrases, rhymes, rhythms, but in ideas, 
emotions. The grim and haughty humor of this lady 
strikes deep, so deep as to absorb her dreams and possess 
her soul. She feels immense incongruities, and the 
incongruity of her little ego among them moves her art 
not to grandeur but to scorn. As a satirist she is at times 
almost sublime — what contrary devil balks her even at 
those moments, tempting her art to its most inscrutable 
perversities? 

Youth is sometimes penetrating in self-diagnosis. I 
am tempted to recall the first poem Miss Moore ever 
published— 7%i2/ Harp You Play So Welly from the 1915 
group ih Poetry: 

O David, if I had 

Your power, I should be glad — 

In harping, with the sling. 

In patient reasoning! 

Blake, Homer, Job, and you, 
Have made old wine-skins new. 

Your energies have wrought 

Stout continents of thought. 

But, David, if the heart 
Be brass, what boots the art 

Of exorcising wrong. 

Of harping to a song? 

The sceptre and the ring 

And every royal thing 

Will fail. Griefs lustiness 
Must cure the harp's distress. 

"If the heart be brass . . • every royal thing will fail." 

It is not this reviewer who says that, or invokes for this 
poet "grief's lustiness." May even grief soften a heart of 
brass? And is a deep resistless humor like Miss Moore's 
the most subtly corrosive destroyer of greatness?

A MYSTIC WARRIOR 

The Mystic Warrior^ by James Oppenheim. A. A. Knopf. 
We might count as art every cross-country flyer cutting 
its shriek into a black sky or a blue sky; every sky-scraper 
flinging windows, light, smoke into an incredulous sky; 
every unimpeachable bath-room trinity; the giant torsos 
of boilers and bellies of gas-tanks; the bird-ltke or 
fish-like aeroplane; the architecture of the farm — silo, 
granary and barn; or, for the matter of that, the fields of 
grain themselves, the vain prodigal orchards. It is in 
the air to do this. Out of such industrial shapes men are 
making violent tragic-comic drama, ruled as in art by the 
mathematics of the elements. So the analogy is close 
and tempting, and we can point that way to America as 
rich in self-expression. Or we may follow another trend 
of fashion — an import out of French dadaism or a mood 
synchronous with it — and abandon the word art altogether 
as an obsolete and paupered notion. A composer of genius 
was recently heard to bandy the idea of an anti-art 
society, where he said, lightly but seriously, any artist of 
consequence belonged. Ben Hecht in his first work of 
size follows his apparently biographic hero to say it is not 


A Mystic Warrior 

"art" he wants, "art is something he can spit out in 
conversation." In a foreword to an exhibition of his 
photographs Alfred Stieglitz formally junks the word 
along with a number of abstractions. Yet it was a word 
concrete enough to artists, not so long dead either — 
Cfaanne, Degas, Rodin, Whistler — to whom the living 
still pay homage. 

People may be wiped from the face of the earth, but art is. 

And there are still those who echo this as a hard truth, 
in whose eyes even the machine has. been unable to break 
the essential sequence of things. They have need of this 
word to name the one human reality running so close to 
all reality as to far outstrip that vanity, self-expression; 
as to make shapes more intentional, more delicate, more 
potent than any American industry has yet made. In 
the pages of The Mystic JVarriory an analysis of himself, 
James Oppenheim writes himself down as one of these. 
His sense of the relentless absolutes of art, his denial of 
himself as an absolute, instil this poem with a deep 
candor, a kind of darkened tranquillity — virtues rare 
enough today to mean in themselves distinction: 

The artist, finally the artist? 

America shuns him, cutting herself off from her own greatness: 

But lie comes nevertheless ... he is Walt riding on top a bus, and Poe 

dreaming of stars in a cottage with his wife dying, 
And Emerson, absent-minded, minded of the Oversoul, in G)ncord 

woods. 
And Hawthorne moody in sad Puritanism, 


And Mark Twain smoking cigars in bed, sweating and groaning over 

Huckleberry Finn, 
And giant-like tearful Dreiser, and Sandburg sitting in a newspaper 

office. 
And Vachel Lindsay jazzing in Paradise (or is it Springfield, Illinois?) 
And Masters among all souls in strange Spoon River. 

So I speak for the artist ... 

But also I speak for the multitude like myself, with equal struggles and 

the same yearnings. 
The same sorrows, joys and lamenting. 
But no gift: inarticulate, frustrated, America's victims. 

There is the argument, in the unfolding of which per- 
haps Oppenheim does not quite go the length of candor. 
For his indecisions and his failures he can't resist blaming 
America more than the mere fact that the inevitable 
image, word, phrase come seldom to him. You enjoy the 
drift of the book, but you have to ignore more than one 
lapse of taste — that unerring instinct for the word and the 
place. Perhaps too breathless an awe has sometimes 
defeated him. There is a hint of this in the picture of a 
meeting with "our most powerful novelist*' — Theodore 
Dreiser, one is led to suppose: 

So we walk, we talk. 

And here is the Hudson, the North River, with shouting gold of sunset 

and smokes of the tugboats. 
Shadows of cliiFs, like the spacious threshold of a spiritual universe; 
And I grow tense with the wonder of it and feel the artist's despair of 

setting it down in words ... 
So I turn to hihi: " J"st look," I say, "could you describe that?" 
He speaks carelessly: 
"Oh, yes— that or anything." 


A Mystic Warrior 

Yet this reverence for great vision, great craft, has had 
its reward, the reward of concentration — workmanship. If 
this writer were a house-painter, you might not always 
like the colors he mixed, but his surfaces, his finish would 
be scrupulous. So The Mystic Warrior contains pictures, 
— indelible pictures, snatches of rhythm, voices: pictures 
of childhood in NeW York schools and brownstone houses; 
pictures of a death and a funeral: 

I am a tailor: I am cutting and sewing a pair of pants for my little 
brother: 

My little grandmother cgmes in, walks softly, inaudibly by me ... . 
She carefully pulls down the shades, making the room yellow . . . 
I confront her: "Why do you pull down the shades, grandma?" 

She says there is too much sunlight . . . 

Then she looks at me, hesitates, takes me by the arm. 

Whispers in my ears, "James, your father is dead." 

I smell flowers — lilies, roses, violets — I shall never forget that smell . . 
I am taken down in the long parlor . . . 

There are people there: uncles and aunts, grandpa, grandma . . . 
There are camp-stools, and a black-cloth coffin smothered in flowers . . 

And now my infancy is ended . . . 

For this is death; I have come face to face with my enemy, death . . 

Servant-girls soothed me, saying, "He is an angel now." . . . 

Vivid portraits of people; pictures of offices, wharves 
homes; pictures of a Jewish bourgeoisie in New York, 
redolent of the race, recalling the riches Rembrandt made 
of the same theme in Amsterdam centuries ago; and the 
breath of countless streets: 

Old days on the West Side, 

Old nights. 

Summer nights when there was a faint G)ney Island stir down electric- 
lit Eighth Avenue . . . 
A moth-sdr, flame, shadow, Bagdad. 

There is unction in The Mystic Warrior^ but almost no 
sham, no bunk. At its best the tenor of it is curiously 
dark and steady — a suggestion of slow night rkin, or a ship 
at anchor in night waters. The poem succeeds in being a 
distillation, in contrast to the brew made, it seems, after 
the recipe: "To hell with work, novelty will provide the 
kick." Oppenheim, you feel, has earned the right to say: 

In the grey air we walk, in the glister of the dying year; 
And my soul goes down to roots, and the roots, like a tree's, are deep in 
the earth. 

Acknowledging this, you are even willing to ignore the 
abstract use of the word "soul." 'Dorothy Dudley 

MRS. WYLIe's poems 

Nets to Catch the Windy by Elinor Wylie. Harcourt, 

Brace & Co. 

A lyric voice slight, but clear and fine, may be heard in 
this book, the voice of a free and lightly ranging spirit. 
The sound of it is now gay, now grave, but always it holds 
a little aloof — one detects that something "austere, 
immaculate" for which the poet herself holds her Puritan 
ancestry responsible. In a number of poems her mood is 
thoughtfully admonitory, as The Eagle and the Mole^ 
Madman's Songy or Say Not of Beauty she is Good: 


Mrs. Wylie*5 Poems 

Oh, she 18 neither good nor bad, 

But innocent and wild. 
Enshrine her and she dies, who had 

The hard heart of a child. 

Again, it is meditative or descriptive, or, as in Valentine^ 
self-searching. But always the emotion is shy and deli- 
cate, as of a cool small wild-flower growing, by some 
whim of Nature, not in the woods, but in the protected 
area of a garden. The flower is very simple and of quiet 
color, but it has an individual vitality nevertheless. 

The Eagle and the Mole^ urging toward the high or the 
profound as against a safe "middle-of-the-road" policy, is 
perhaps the most temptingly quotable poem in the book. 
But as it has already gone the rounds, and as Poetry has 
printed Vehet Shoes and certain others, we prefer to offer 
The PrinkirC Leddie as an example of pure and irresistible 
gayety — a mood extremely rare in modern art: 

"The Hielan* lassies are a' for spinnin' 
The Lowlan' lassies for prinkin' and pinnin'; 
My daddie w'u'd chide me, an' so w'u'd my minnie 
If I s'u'd bring hame sic a prinkin' leddie." 

Now haud your tongue, ye haverin' coward. 
For whilst I'm young, I'll go flounced an' flowered. 
In lutestring striped like the strings o' a fiddle, 
Wi' gowden girdles aboot my middle. 



My silks are stiff wi' patterns o' siller, 
I've an ermine hood like the hat o' a miller, 
I've chains o' coral like rowan berries, 
An' a cramoisie mantle that cam' frae Paris. 



When the skies are low an' the earth is frozen, 
Ye'U be gay an' gled for the leddie ye've chosen. 
When ower the snow I go prinkin' and prancin' 
In my wee red slippers were made for dtmcin'. 

It's better a leddie like Solomon's lily 
Than one that'll run like a Hielan' gillie 
A-linkin' it ower the leas, my laddie. 
In a raggedy kilt an' a belted plaidie! 

An unusually interesting first book. H. M. 

THOUGHTFUL MEASURES 

Out of Misty by Florence Kilpatrick Mixter. Boni & 

Liveright. 

Carefully studied, delicately wrought, are these poems — 
this sequence of twenty-nine sonnets followed by as many 
other poems. If they are in a sense too studied and de- 
liberate, they yet express genuine emotion in grave and 
thoughtful measures of modern straightness and sim- 
plicity — there is no pretense in the feeling, and rarely a 
trace of rhetoric or palaver in the style. The best of 
them rise to a quiet beauty and distinction — Lullaby^ 
which was in Poetry last summer, is a fine lyric; and this 
one. To a Young Girly is almost as quotable, though the 
word holocaust is a bit melodramatic: 

I had forgotten there were hearts so young 

As yours, tonight, 
Whose voice, now echoing with songs unsung. 

Fills me with strange delight. 

I had forgotten there were eyes so swift 
Of April mirth, 


Thoughtful Measures 

Flashing as though with some invisible gift 
From Heaven t6 Earth. 

I had forgotten there were lips that pray, 

Like a gray-winged dove. 
For one more hour of laughter and of play 

Before the holocaust of love. 

The sonnet sequence hints at the story of a youthful 
love affair finished by autocratic death. We follow it a 
little apart, watching "out of mist," through translucent 
veils, an experience not unusual, not strongly individual- 
ized, but for that very reason of wide appeal. Many a 
first love-story appears here in thoughtiul reminiscence, 
its joy and sadness real, but softened by time and change. 
In sonnet XXVII we have the climax of it: 

In memory I sit beside your bed 

And see again the smile that lit your face; 

Nor do the slow forgetful years erase 

A syllable of those last words we said. 

For, through my tears, seeing your brightness fled 

Because of them, I pled with Heaven for grace 

To make you smile once more, while with quick pace 

I heard night passing that would leave you dead. 

Swiftly I took your hand and held it tight. 

Then told in words that choked me ever after 

Some foolish trifling thing. And though the light 

That came with your brave laugh was gone thereafter, 

Yet, as a rocket fills the quiet night 

With falling stars, I hear again your laughter. 

Cradle Song, Dressing Up, Elegy, and The Candle use 
the familiar four-line measure to present emotions of 
flower-like grace. H. M, 
OUR CONTEMPORARIES 

NEW INTERNATIONAL MAGAZINES 

Three magazines which aim at international authority 
and circulation send us their first numbers from Rome, 
London and New York. All three appear in a luxury of 
format and typography more easily attained abroad than 
here; attainable here, indeed, only at a cost so high as 
to be almost prohibitive. We have, first. The Broom^ 
described as "an international magazine of the arts 
published by Americans in Italy" (at i8 Triniti dei 
Monti), and edited by Harold A. Loeb and Alfred 
Kreymborg, with Giuseppe Prezzolini as associate editor; 
second, Fanfare^ "a musical causerie issued on the first 
and fifteenth of the month," edited by Leigh Henry and 
published by Goodwin & Tabb, Ltd., at 34 Percy Street, 
London; and, third, we have the resuscitated Little 
RevieWy issued as a seven-doUar-a-year "quarterly of arts 
and letters," in an initial autumn number, from 27 West 
Eighth Street, New York, the " administration " consisting 
of Margaret Anderson, "jh," Ezra Pound and Francis 
Picabia. 

In The Broom Alfred Kreymborg shows once more his 
ability as an editor, but the new paper does not "start 
something," nor arouse the excitement of anticipation, to 
the degree that the first number of Others did in July, 191 5. 
There is much variety in the contents, which range from 


New International Magazines 

a strictly correct sonnet by Walter de la Mare to phan- 
tasmagoric designs in black and white and gray from 
paintings in the most approved cubistic manner by 
Albert Gleizes and Juan Gris. 

We see many familiar names among the fifteen or so 
literary contributors: Lew Sarett has a Maple-sugar Song 
of the Chippewas; Amy Lowell offers a three-page chant 
in praise o( Lilacs — 

Your great puffs of flowers 

Are evcrjrwhcre in this my New England. 

Lola Ridge sings of Hospital Nights; Wallace Gould offers 
a prose-poem narrative about Mamia. The only other 
verse-entries are some Chinese poems of J. Wing, trans- 
lated by E. Powys Mathers, and a twelve-line rhymed 
poem, Lake^ by Bayard Boyeson, which opens the number. 
Other poets appear in prose: James Stephens with a 
tragic Dublin story, Hunger, as ruthless and terrible in its 
deliberate detail as the title implies; James Oppenheim 
with a quite wonderful study of a sanely insane mind; 
Haniel Long with a whimsical sketch. Conrad Aiken, 
Louis Untermeyer and Emmy Sanders offer certain 
critical inquiries concerning poets and their art, and the 
invasion of Europe by America. In short, almost every- 
one appears except the over-modest Mr. Kreymborg. 

The magazine has a beautifully printed page about five 
by seven inches, set sumptuously in hand-made large- 
paper measuring nearly nine by thirteen.. 

Fanfare y which is primarily musical, blows a gay trumpet 
as it enters: 

Fartfare — does not the word suggest something stirring, brilliant, 
joyous, exciting — something which preludes adventure? . . . We are 
the heralds of the new era, sounding the fanfare for its union with new 
beauty. Such union calls for revelry; hence our Fartfare will be merry. 
. . . We set forth boldly, our trumpets bright to reflect sunlight, our 
Far^ere ringing truly alike for ritual, ceremony, battle, joust, forlorn 
hope, festival, triumph or masquerade. 

This paper, although a musical periodical, believes, like 
Poetry, in a closer alliance of the arts. Its editor thinks 
that musicians are too narrowly trained — therefore 

Fanfare will deal with literature, drama, painting, sculpture, and theatre- 
craft, as matters a knowledge of which forms a necessary complement to 
musical culture. 

So we have two or three clever drawings and a poem by 
John Gould Fletcher among the musical entries within 
the gaily decorative cover of Fanfare* s first number. 

The Little Review is larger than of yore — an hundred 
and twelve pages measuring more than seven inches by 
nine. It aims at the very latest thing, and achieves, as 
its piece de resistance^ a fifty-page poem by Jean Cocteau, 
translated by Jean Hugo, The Cape of Good Hope. Having 
read half of it, and being still in a state of innocence, I 
commend the rest to those who can watch " the dangerous 
hallucinations continue." 

On the way to Cocteau, we have Ezra Pound on Bran- 
cusi, illustrated; some Fumigations by Picabia, a phi*

New International Magazines 

losophy of Psycho-democracy set forth by Mina Loy, 
poems in French by Paul Morand and in German by 
Ivan Goll. Also there are some rather outspoken tales, 
and Ezra Pound tells us all of our sins in a Historical 
Survey, 

It is said that Mr. Pound readopted The Little Review 
because of its editor's brave fight against the suppression 
of James Joyce's Ulysses. Well, it was a brave fight — any 
fight against the censor's gag-laden fist takes bravery. 
The trouble is, The Little Review never knows when to 
stop. Just now it seems to be headed straight toward 
Dada; but we could forgive even that if it would drop 
Else von Freytag-Loringhoven on the way. 

VARIOUS PRIZES 

The DiaPs first award of its annual prize of two thousand 
dollars, for one of its contributors, was announced Decem- 
ber first. It goes to Sherwood Anderson, of Chicago, the 
distinguished author of a number of novels and short 
stories, and of Mid-American Chants y poems in free verse, 
of which a group first appeared in Poetry for September, 

This is the most generous literary prize as yet awarded 
in this country; an admirable example which should have 
a train of followers. Although Mr. Anderson's contribu- 
tions to The Dial have been in prose, his being a poet as 
well gives Poetry the opportunity to congratulate him, 

and also the staff of the magazine which honors him. 

The Poetry Society of America announces the award 
of two prizes, each of five hundred dollars: 

First, the prize offered for the best book of verse by 
an American poet, published in the United States during 
the year 1920, is divided equally between Heavens and 
Earthy by Stephen Vincent Ben6t, and Smoke and Steely 
by Carl Sandburg. The judges were Richard Le Gal- 
lienne, William Lyon Phelps and Harriet Monroe. 

Second, the prize offered in the William Lindsey 
Contest for poetic drama has been awarded to Harry 
Lee for his four-act play, // Poverello, One hundred and 
forty-five plays were submitted, and the judges were 
Stuart Walker, George Arliss, George P. Baker, Jane 
Dransfield and Jessie B. Rittenhouse. 

The Friday Club of Chicago, at a recent meeting of its 
board of directors, voted fifty dollar^ to Poetry as a 
prize for a young poet for the current year. 

This gift is acknowledged with special pleasure as it is 
the first offer of the kind which Poetry has received 
from any women's club, or indeed from any society. A 
number of clubs, in Chicago and elsewhere, have given 
annual prizes to painters, sculptors, and perhaps musi- 
cians; we hope that the Friday Club's example will remind 
them that prizes to poets, being excessively rare, should 
have the preference from clubs largely devoted, as most 
of them are, to the study of literature. 


CORRESPONDENCE 



A LETTER FROM PARIS 



My 'Dear Poetry: Interest in American letters seems 
to be increasing in France. As one evidence, note that 
the program required for the English-teaching certificate 
contains Frost's North oj Boston. This is due to M. Charles 
Cestre, the well-known professor of American literature at 
the Sorbonne. I consider it a bold step to admit in 
University studies a quite modern poet whose genius has 
not yet been fully acknowledged by our critics. 

French verse is still a matter of discussion. Yet Paul 
Val6ry seems to attract partisans from sundry corners: 

La lune mince verse line lueur sacr^, 
Toute une jupe d'un tissu d'argent l^er 
Sur les bases de marbre ou vient I'ombre songer. 
Que suit d'un char de perles une gaze nacr^ 

A scintillating symphony of vowels; and a modern render- 
ing of an old romantic theme. Val6ry and a few other 
poets have united to form a "New P16iade." The original 
French P16iade, you remember, was formed at a moment 
when the French language needed clarification and 
enriching. What seems to be the aim of the actual 
P16iade? The names of the members will speak for them- 
selves: Countess Mathieu de Noailles, Pierre Camo, 
Derennes, Gasquet, de Magallon, Mazade, Val6ry — all 
artists of classical or semi-classical verse. It is a protest 
against the extremist and cryptic schools of art. The 

G>untess is a great favorite among women, tender youths, 
priests (if I dare trust a friend's testimony), and bourgeois 
readers in whose ears still lingers the flowing cadence of 
our traditional verse. Camo writes finely-chiselled sonnets 
and odes in which the modern notes blend exquisitely with 
fading reminiscences. Gasquet was a fiery artist of the 
South, whose experiments in polyphonic stanzas, together 
with alexandrines, have just been cut short by death. 
Our poetical tradition has definitely acquired a pliancy 
which not even the attempts at classic tragedy of the 
ofiicial Com6die Fran^aise are able to endanger. Even 
Max Jacob, the sweet child of humor, who keeps apart 
from any coterie with his bons mots and new faith — even 
Max Jacob writes exquisitely modulated alexandrines. 
You see that our extremists, Dada excepted (but who 
knows what they mean? — not even Ezra Pound), display 
a certain coquetry towards our well ordered muse: 

Le ciel a pour la mer des regards qui b^nissent, 
Le soleil sur la mer est un bateau qui glisse, 
Chaque lame a son or, chaque ^ume a sa nuit . • . 

What do you think of this gold-and-black up-to-date 
fabric? — 

Every wave has its gold; every foam has its night. 

More robust and more thoughtful has become the muse 
of Vildrac, and of Romains. The Chants du Desesperiy by 
Charles Vildrac, ring with the sorrow of the poet's bruised 
dreams. Vildrac bends over the corpse of his friend, a 


A Letter from Paris 

victim of the war; he turns his clear eyes on his suffering 
fellow-men; he sees more ugliness than before. 

Jules Remains {Le Voyage des Amants) seems to remain 
more true to his former philosophy. A smiling fancy, 
direct sensations of Paris and the world, with sometimes a 
cosmic vista: 

Lea jours grandissent, 

Chaque jour est un coup plus dur 

Port6 plus profond dans la nuit; 

Et la matiere des t^n^bres 

Tantot moUe, tantot cassante, 

Se pulverise ou s'aplatit. 

The art of the New P16iade and of the Unanimists 
make this a great epoch for French poetry. Alas! that 
it should not also be glorious for the French drama! But 
here we have to deplore that our official theatres leave to 
private and too little moneyed initiative the production 
of new, vigorous and audacious plays. The G>m6die 
Fran^aise practically gave nothing worth mentioning 
apart from the classical r6pertoire. La Mort Enchainee^ 
by Maurice Magre, has won a prize of a few thousand 
francs for the best new play, and it is grievously accurate 
that this heavy and obscure mythological drama was 
merely one of the passable novelties of the Com6die. As 
for the Odfon, we feel sure that the new play by Paul Fort 
is going to make up for the stuff that has been produced 
there in the course of the few past months. But of course 
we have our secondary stages: the Vieux Colombier, 
the Th6ltre des Arts; and we have the Group of the Six. 

I shall have occasion to write you about this young 
group of Six Musicians, and about Jean G>cteau as a poet. 
Let me say now that Les Maries de la Tour Eiffely played 
at the finest and most comfortable theatre in Paris, the 
Champs Elys^es, before a smart audience and a good 
number of buoyantly hostile traditionalists, has not 
proved a failure. It is a farce mimed by dancers for 
actors, while a phonograph explains, in the words of 
Cocteau, the progress of the plot. A nervous cerebral 
music, with here and there patches of sunlight, has been 
composed by the Six. It is a healthy combination of 
sound, color, and gesture; with no human voice, which 
may be deplored, but at least with nothing of the thunder- 
ing declamation of too many comedians. Jean Catel

Are You a Connoisseur of Art? 

Keep up with the times— read POETRY 



The New York Sunday Tribune of Jan. Qth, 1921, said editorially, 
in quoting seven poems from our January number: 
'The varied interest and beauty presented are typical of 
Poktry's quality. Thanks to a rare coincidence of poise and gener- 
ous imagination, of sense and sensitiveness, it ranks as easily the best 
vdhide of poetry in the English language." 

In the London Times of Nov. 25th, ig20, we read: 

*^t need not linger over the many English and French con- 
tributors to this periodical. . . We do have to note that it has 
published, as it honestly claims, much of the best experimental 
poetry written by Americans in the past eight years. . . They have 
succeeded in their primary design — ^te create a poetry which should 
be American in thought, feeling, subject, and form. That is, after 
all, a distinct aduevement" 

The Chicago Evening Post, in commenting on POETRY'S eighth 

birthday^ said: 

**So editorship is infallible, but it is rather interesting and 
enlightening to look over the old numbers of Poetry and to realize 
that the first important chance for publication in America was ^ven 
to many poets, almost unknown, wno have since obtained fame. . . 
We wonder how many more may yet be helped. Poetry is, so far 
as we know, unique in the length of its Ufe, recognized position and 
rigorously artistic standard."

POEMS BY WANG WEI 

ANSWERING VICE-PREFECT CHANG 

AS the years go by, give me but peace, 
Freedom from ten thousand matters. 
I ask myself and always answer, 
What can be better than coming home? 
A wind from the pine-trees blows my sash, 
And my lute is bright with the mountain-moon. 
You ask me about good and evil? . . . 
Hark, on the lake there's a fisherman singing! 

BOUND HOME TO MOUNT SUNG 

The limpid river, past its bushes 
Flowing slowly as my chariot, 

Seems a fellow- voyager 

Returning with the evening-birds. 

A ruined city-wall overtops an old ferry, 

Autumn sunset floods the peaks. . . . 

Far away, beside Mount Sung, 

I shall rest and close my door. 

A MESSAGE TO p'aI TI 

Cold and blue now are the mountains 
From autumn-rain that beat all day. 
By my thatch-door, leaning on my stafi^, 
I listen to cicadas in the evening wind. 
Sunset lingers at the ferry, 
Cooking-smoke floats up from the houses. . . . 
Oh, when shall I pledge Chieh-yu again. 
And sing a wild poem at Five Willows! 

ON THE WAY TO THE TEMPLE 

Not knowing the way to the Temple of Heaped Fragrance, 

I have roamed, under miles of mountain-cloud. 

Old woods without a human track. 

But far on the height I hear a bell, 

A rillet sings over winding rocks. 

The sun is tempered by green pines. . . . 

At twilight, close to an emptying pool, 

I lie and master the Passion-dragon. 


Witter Bynner and Kiang Kang-hu 

MOUNT CHUNG-NAN 

The Great One's height near the City of Heaven 
Joins a thousand mountains to the corner of the sea. 
Clouds, when I look back, close behind me; 
Mists, when I enter them, arc gone. 
A central peak divides the wilds 
And weather into many valleys. . . . 
Needing a place to spend the night, 
I call to a wood-cutter over the river. 

A VIEW OF THE HAN RIVER 

With its three Hsiang branches it reaches Ch'u border 

And with nine streams touches the gateway of Ching: 

This river runs beyond heaven and earth. 

Where the color of mountains both is and is not. 

The dwellings of men seem floating along 

On ripples of the distant sky. . . . 

O Hsiang-yang, how your beautiful days 

Make drunken my old mountain-heart! 

IN MY LODGE AT WANG-CH'uAN 
AFTER A LONG RAIN 

The woods have stored the rain, and slow comes the smoke 
As rice is cooked on faggots and carried to the fields; 
Over the quiet marshland flies a white egret. 
And mango-birds are singing in the full summer trees. 



I 



I have learned to watch in peace the mountain morning- I 

glories, 
To eat split dewy sunflower-seeds under a bough of pine, I 

To yield the place of honor to any boor at all. ... I 

Why should I frighten sea-gulls even with a thought? 

MY RETREAT AT CHUNG-NAN 

My heart in middle age found the Way, 

And I came to dwell at the foot of this mountain. 

When the spirit moves, I wander alone 

Where beauty is known only to me. 

I will walk till the water checks my path. 

Then sit and watch the rising clouds. 

And some day meet an old woodcutter, 

And talk and laugh and never return. 

IN A RETREAT AMONG BAMBOOS 

Alone I am sitting under close bamboos, 
Playing on my lute, singing without words. 
Who can hear me in this thicket? . . . 
Bright and friendly comes the moon. 

LINES 

You who arrive from my old country. 

Tell me what has happened there! 

Did you see, when you passed my silken window. 

The first cold blossom of the plum ? 


Witter By finer and Kiang Kang-hu 



A PARTING 



Friend, I have watched you down the mountain 
Till now in the dark I dose my thatch-door. . . 
Grasses return again green in the spring, 
But, O Wang Sun, will you return? 



A SONG AT WEI-CH ENG 



The morning rain settled the dust in Wei-ch'eng; 
In the yard of the tavern green willows revive. . . 
Oh, wait to empty one more cup! 
West of Yang Gate — no old friends! 



THE BEAUTIFUL HSI-SHIH 

Since beauty is honored all over the empire. 

How. could Hsi-shih remain humbly at home? 

At dawn washing clothes by a lake in Yueh; 

At dusk in the Palace of Wu, a great lady! 

Poor, no rarer than the others — 

Exalted, everyone praising her rareness. 

But above all honors, the honor was hers 

Of blinding with passion an emperor's reason. 

Girls who had once washed silk beside her 

Now were ordered away from her carriage. . . . 

Ask them, in her neighbors' houses. 

If by wrinkling their brows they can copy her beauty. 

A SONG OF YOUNG GIRLS FROM LO-YANG 

There are girls from Lo-yang in that door across the street, 

Some of them fifteen and some a little older. 

While their master rides a rapid horse with jade bit and 

bridle/ 
Their handmaid brings them codfish on a golden plate. 
On the painted pavilions, facing their red towers. 
Cornices are pink and green with peach-bloom and with 

willow; 
Canopies of silk awn their seven-scented chairs; 
Rare fans shade them home, to their nine-flowered cur- 
tains. 
Their lord, with rank and wealth and in the green of life. 
Exceeds, for magnificence, even Chi-lun; 
He favors girls of lowly birth and teaches them to dance. 
And he gives away his coral-trees to almost anyone. 
The wind of dawn just stirs when his nine soft lights go out, 
Those nine soft lights like petals in a flying chain of 

flowers. 
From play to play they have barely time for singing over 

the songs; 
No sooner are they dressed again than incense burns before 

them. 
Those they know in town are only the rich and the lavish, 
And day and night they're visiting the homes of Chao and 

Li. . . . 
Who cares about a girl from Yueh, face jade-white, 
Humble, poor, alone, by the river, washing silk! 


Witter Bynner and Kiang Kang-hu 

HARMONIZING A POEM BY PALACE-ATTENDANT KUO 

High beyond the thick wall a tower shines with sunset, 
Where peach and plum are blooming and willow-cotton 

flies. 
You have heard it in your office, the court-bell of twilight: 
Birds discover perches, officials head for home. 
Your morning-jade will tinkle as you thread the golden 

palace. 
You will bring the word of heaven from the closing gates 

at night. 
And I should serve there with you; but, being full of years, 
I have put aside official robes and am resting from my ills. 

A GREEN STREAM 

I have come on the River of Yellow Flowers, 

Borne by the current of a green stream 

Rounding ten thousand turns through the mountains 

To journey less than a hundred li. 

Rapids hum on scattered stones, 

Light is dim in the close pines. 

The surface of an inlet sways with nut-horns. 

Weeds are lush along the banks. 

Down in my heart I have always been clear 

As this clarity of waters. 

Oh, to remain on a broad flat rock 

And cast my fishing-line forever! 

Translated from the Chinese 
by Witter Bynner and Kiang Kang-hu 

IN PRAISE OF ABRIGADA 

I had been told 

A foolish tale — 

Of stone — dank — cold: 

But you. 

Held to wide winter storm. 

To clutch of blackening frost and ocean gale, 

Are warm! 

I thought that stone was silent too, 

Unmoved by beauty. 

Unaware of season or of mirth: 

But I hear laughter, singing, as I lay 

My face against your gray; 

Surely I hear the ritual of far waves 

And scent their winging spray. 

Mixed with wild-rose and honeysuckle. 

Budding sassafras. 

And the cool breath of pungent, leafy bay. 

I knew that walls were sheltering 

And strong; 

But you have sheltered love so long 

That love is part 

Of your high towering. 

Lifting you higher still. 

As heart lifts heart. . . . 




Hush! 

How the whip-poor-will 

Wails from his bush: 

The thrush 

Grows garrulous with delight! 

There is a rapture in that liquid monotone, 

"Bob White! Boh— fFhiter' 

Dear living stone! 

In the great room below, 

Where arches hold the listening spaces, 

Flames crackle, leap and gleam 

In the deep fire-places; 

Memories dream . . . 

Of other memories, perhaps. 

Of gentle lives. 

Of births, and of those other births that men call death. 

Of voices, foot-steps tapping the stone floor, 

And faces . . . faces . . . 

Beyond, the open door, 

The meadows drowsy with the moon. 

The faint outline of dune. 

The lake, the silver magic in the trees: 

Walls, you are one with these! 



High on the loggia-roof. 
Under the stars as pale as they, 

Two silent ones have crept away, 
Seeking the deeper silence lovers know: 
Into the radiant shadows of the night, 
Into the aching beauty of the night. 
They dare to go! 

The moon 

Is a vast cocoon. 

Spinning her wild, white thread 

Across the sky. 

A thousand crickets croon 

Their sharp-edged lullaby. 

I hear a murmuring of lips on lips: 

"All that I am, beloved! 

All!"— 

Lovers' eternal cry! 

Lift them still higher, wall! 

You stand serene: 

The great winds linger, lean 

Upon your breast; 

The mist 

Lifts up a gray face to be kissed; 

The east and west 

Hang you with banners. 

Flaunt their bold victories of dusk and dawn; 

Seasons salute you as they pass. 

Call to you and are gone. 






Amid your meadow-grass 
Lush, green, 
You stand serene. 



Houses, like hearts, are living, loving, 

Joyful or woeful. 

Forget or are forgot; 

Houses, like tired hearts. 

Sicken at last, and die. 

Crumble and rot: 

But they who know you, Abrigada, 

They — and I — 

Forget you not! 

Nor they who stand on Abrigada's roof, 
Glowing, aloof! 

Come with me now. 

Climb with me, stand, look down 

In new content of mood, 

Withdrawn from clasp of crowd 

And tangle of the town! 

Climb swifter still — 

From safe companionship of doud 

The deeper to look down! 

Not back! 

Forget the thirst, the sordid cup, 

The plethora, the piteous lack; 

Forget the trafficking in tears, 

The arrogance of scars. 

Look up . . . 

To dream undaunted dreams aloud. 

And stumble toward the stars! 

This be in praise 

Of Abrigada; 

In all the ways 

That come to me 

Through the wise^ wistful summer Jays. 

In speechy in rhyme and rhythm of word — 
Call it a poem^ maybe! 

In song — tuck the brown shining wood 

Under my chin! 

Call it my birdy 

My hearty 

My violin! 

In prayer ... 

In dream . . . 

In silenccy best of ally 

Leaning on the beloved dew-drenched wall. 

Leaning and lifting . . . 

High ... 

fVith Abrigada* s gesture toward the sky. 




AN OLD WOMAN 

Something within her makes her live so long — 

It pays no heed that all her friends are dead. 
Her age is moving as a simple song. 

Wailing that happy days long since are dead. 
Something forgets that all her tfceth have dropt, 

That eyes no longer serve to see her ways. 
Time seems not weary of this weed uncropt, 

And draws her on into these newer days. 
She does not know at night if she will rise 

And wake again to live another day. 
Eternity of age now makes her wise — 

A thing on point of passing, hear her say: 

"The moon outlasts my days; the sleepless hounds 
Bark ever in the night — ^strange haunting sounds." 

I COMPLAIN IN PASSING 

I am weary of green in the grass. 

Of green in the trees; 
Of blue in the sky^ of white on the clouds, 

And things like these. 
I pray for one boon down the long white day — 

That I may cease; 
For mountain and meadow and grove and sky 

Leave me no peace. 

Harlow Clarke 

WINTER DAWN 

The dark rolls back. 

Like dropped stars, 

The willows shine on the sides of the water-courses: 

Their ice-blades clash, 

Making a slow thin music. 

So wakes he, Tem-Sotetc-Kwi; 

So comes he slowly — like a slow thin music. 

Ah — ah — hi-i, brothers! Lovers of trails and sea-paths! 

It is the time of sorrow and the time of shutting-in: 

For he has come again — Tem-Sotetc-Kwi — 

With heavy winds, 

Like frozen ropes of cedar, hoary. 

Uncoiling from his thighs 

To bind the world. 

I have seen his white moccasins upon the mountain: 
His steps have hushed the waters 
Of the great and little falls; 
The rushing rivers are stopped. 

He has fed the lake's watery breast to the White Bear 
That follows him. 

The canoes of the Coast-dwellers are hung under the roofs 
Like empty cradles: 

We can no longer rock on the wings of the great Blue 
Heron! 

The great Blue Heron has hidden herself 


Constance Lindsay Skinner 

Under the thatch of her nest, 

Because of his pale gray foxes, with white ears — 

His hungry foxes, 

Huddled about the brink of her nest. 

He has taken away the brown fields, 

Where our bare feet danced with Autumn 

At the feast of berries and maize — 

The bare brown fields that were- glad 

When we drummed with our brown bare feet. 

Singing, "Hoy-mah-ah! hoy a-mah!" 

Ai-hi! The mats his witch- woman weaves for him are 

thick and cold: 
We have put beaver-fur about our feet. 
And made us long, long flat shoes to bear us up. 
(This is our magic, wise men's magic, 
To save us from the White Bear's maw!) 
His great snowy owls fill all our cedars. 
Aii-hi! The red breasts of woodpeckers 
No longer flicker in our forests. 
His witch-woman is plucking the wings of the sky, 
The air is stuflFed with white feathers: 
We no longer may speak with the sun — ai-i ! 
Gravely, with bowed hearts, we greet you, 
O Tem-Sotetc-Kwi, Snow-chief, Ice-hunter, 
Priest of the Long White Moons! 

Slowly, slowly, like thin music. 
Murmur the sorrow-chant, 

Coast-dwellers, my brothers: 

For Tem-Sotetc-Kwi has carved the death totem 

Over Swiya's house-door — 

^'«/jc — se — wag — ila — ^making pure! 

Our mother Swiya, Swiya our mother is dead. 

Sorrow, sorrow, my tribe, for Swiya! 

Much joy had Swiya, our mother, who loved three lovers! 

As a maid, boldly she went forth 

And met Spring among the willows; 

He pierced her with hope. 

Singing she entered the green doors of Summer; 

Singing she came out, girdled with fragrance. 

She took the yellow harvest-moon in her hands, 

And waited in the maize-fields behind our village. 

Autumn clasped her there in the fields; he crowned her 

with maize. 
He filled her pouch with berries, he gave her much deer's 

meat. 

Autumn, Feast-maker! Dearest was he among her three 

lovers — 
He was the strong one: he gave the most food; he was the 

last. 
Ai! great joy had Swiya, our mother, who loved three 

lovers, 
And took their gifts. 
All their gifts were ours: Swiya, our mother, kept nothing 

back. 


Constance Lindsay Skinner 

Now she lies bare, her hands are empty, her face is cold; 
Her eyelids are shut, for her eyes are in the Place of Death, 
Under white eyelids! ^ulx — se-wag-ila! 
Tem-Sotetc-Kwi has carved the death-totem over Swiya's 

door. 
Slowly, softly, like thin music, murmur the sorrow-chant 
For Swiya, our mother. Swiya, our mother, is dead. 

^ulx — se — ^ulX'Se-wag'ila waJ 

Gravely, with bowed hearts, we greet you, 
O Tem-Sotetc-Kwi, Snow-chief, Ice-hunter, 
Priest of the Long White Moons!

FROM A CHICAGO "L" 

The great gray houses walk along 
Sombrely and slow. 

Weary in the dusk. 

In a dragging row. 

They are very tired. 

Heart-broken and old; 
They seem to shudder as they pass. 
The winter wind is cold. 

Sarah-Margaret Brown 

FATE 



I have so often 

Examined all this well-known room 

That I inhabit. 

There is the open window; 

There the locked door, the door I cannot open, 

The only doorway. 

When at the keyhole often, often 
I bend and listen, I can always hear 
A muffled conversation. 

An argument: 

An angry endless argument of people 

Who live behind; 

Now loudly talking. 

Now dimly to their separate conflict moving 

Behind the door. 

There they seem prisoned, 

As I, in this lone room that I inhabit: 

My life; my body. 

You, of the previous being. 

You who once made me and who now discuss me. 

Tell me your verdict, and I will obey it! 

You, long ago, 


Harold Monro 

With doubting hands and eager trembling fingers. 
Prepared my room. 

Before I came, 

Each gave his token for remembrance, brought it, 

And then retired behind the bolted door. 

There is the pot of honey 

One left, and there the jar of vinegar 

On the same table. 

Who poured that water 

Shining beside the flask of yellow wine? 

Who sighed so softly? 

Who brought that living flower to the room ? 
Who groaned, that I can ever hear the echo? 
You do not answer. 

Meanwhile from out the window 

Sounds penetrate of building other houses: 

Men building houses. 

And so it may be 

Some day I'll find some doorway in the wall — 

What shall I take them? 

What shall I take them 

Beyond those doorways, in the other rooms? 

What shall I bring them. 

That they may love me? 

Fatal question! 

For all the jangling voices rise together; 

I seem to hear: 

"What shall he take them?" . . . 

Beyond their closed door there's no final answer. 

They are debating. 

II 

O Fate! Have you no other gift 
Than voices in a muffled room? 
Why do you live behind your door, 
And hide yourself in angry gloom? 

And why, again, should you not have 
One purpose only, one sole word, 
Ringing forever round my heart. 
Plainly delivered, plainly heard? 

Your conversation fills my brain 
And tortures all my life, and yet 
Gives no result. I often think 
You've grown so old that you forget; 

And having learnt man's fatal trick 
Of talking, talking, talking still. 
You're tired of definite design. 
And laugh at having lost your will.

HILLSIDE POEMS 



WINTER RAIN 



It is sad, this rain 

Drip-dripping in the night 

Monotonously 

Into the snow; 

Dripping from the corners of the house 

And the ends of black twigs 

All night long without change. 

Rain, rain soft-fingered, 

Lifting up the white snow, 

Uncovering the clay beneath; 

Rain, soft. 

Almost unwilling — 

The fingers of an old woman 

Who cannot resist 

Slipping downstairs in the night 

To the front room. 

And lifting the sheet for a last look 

At what it conceals. 



A NAKED MAPLE 

You have put off your leaves. 

You are like a runner who stands naked at the mark. 

Calm and certain of victory. 



You are glorious in your ease, 

Waiting for the first silver whistle of the snow; 

And in your sureness 

That the yellow medal of a May moon will be pinned to 

your breast, 
Clothed again and triumphant. 

NOONTIME 

Noontime and locusts, 

Locusts goading the heat 

Quivering over the hay-fields; 

Yet the men arise from half-eaten dinners 

And hood canvas over the stacks — 

The full tawny breasts of the hayfields — 

For the first dark finger of lust 

Is pointing over a steeple 

Far in the distance. 



JUDGES 

Between her two brothers, 
Who argue of nations and laws 
With a neighbor. 
She stands, big with a child, 
Watching the sunshine; 
Waiting the end of their talk. 
Saying nothing. 


Frederick R. McCreary 

ALONE ON THE HILL 

Alone on the hill 

In the warm October noon> 

With the woods below 

And beyond their brilliance the sea: 

The moment has come. 

The rapt still instant of being, 

When water and wood are gone. 

There is nothing now 

But the on-running fluid of hours 

Gleaming with blue, yellow, crimson. 

Now quick! Let me run on sharp stones. 

Let me strangle in surf choked with the bitter salt-water! 

Let me feel pain, feel torture. 

And the acid hunger of loneliness! 

Give me self, self — 

Before I am lost 

In this madness of space eternal, 

This horror of dream triumphant. 

Frederick R. McCreary 


INCIDENTALS 

DUST IN THE ROAD 

The dust 

Is a yellow-grey veil 

Over the limbs of the wind. 

And the little breeze dons it, 

That her fleet litheness, 

And the whirling torsions of her sprite's form, 

May be apparent 

As she gaily runs down the road 

To greet us. 

TAPS 

Out of the night, 

Up from the serene valley of the Missouri, 

Over the free forested Kansas hills 

Come notes of a bugle — 

Mincing, silver-slippered steps of music. 

THE STAR 

When the "screws" had made their last round 
And the lights in the cells were out, 
I arose and peered out the window. 
And just over the edge of the prison-wall 
I saw a tiny, twinkling, yellow star 


Hi Simons 



Furtively winking at me, 

Like the eye of the Infinite; 

Mischievously happy 

Because it had slipped me a bit of joy 

Over the wall, from "the outside." 

PORTRAIT OF AN OLD ROUfi 

The seeds of his sin 

Thrust tiny red roots 

Among the cell-crevices of his face. 

Now their minute purple tendrils 

Trace, on his cheeks and nose, 

Vine-patterns as intricately beautiful 

As his fastidious iniquities. 



Hi Simons 



TAK FOR SIDST 

To C. S. 
"Good-bye," you said, and your voice was an echo, a 

promise. 
You turned to go, a grey iron ghost. 
The night took you. 
Insubstantial as air, stronger than iron. 
You were here and had gone. 
Your voice was an omen, an echo. 

Batette Beutsch 
IN THE OFFICE 

THE GUARDIANS 

Old men nodding over great books, 

Always writing with gold pens, 

Every morning 

Adding figures, 

Turning pages; 

Every morning 

A little grayer, 

A little mustier, 

A little older. 

Old men! — do you keep Age 
Hidden between your desks? 
V^^U she catch me 
If I come down to ask you 
For the October statement? 

AILEEN 

She goes through the order of the day 

Like a nun. 

The rattle of her typewriter 

Is the rustle of a rosary; 

And she speaks in the telephone 

With the retreated delicacy 

Of one who murmurs before an altar. 

Gwendolen Haste 


MOTHERHOOD 

Playing alone by the ocean's edge» 

Eager and unafraid. 
You are the child I used to be, 

Playing the games I played. 

Now I have only a coward's heart, 

Finding you all too dear. 
Learning at last that love shall teach | 

The fearless how to fear. i 

You are so little against the sky, 

Laughing and undismayed — 
Oh, little son by the ocean's edge, 

I am afraid, afraid! 

Medora C. Addison I 



THE LOVER 

You do not know the wonder I will pour on your name- 
It will burst like thunder with all heaven for a frame! 
I will raise it as a flame that the wind blows under, 
I will cast myself asunder — to my shame, to my blame! 
I will make a fame, a wonder of your name. 

Paul Tanaquil 

FIRE 

Love, let us light 

A fire tonight, 

A wood fire on the hearth. 

With torn and living tongues the flames leap. 

Hungrily 

They catch and lift, to beat their sudden wings 

Toward freedom and the sky. 

The hot wood sings 

And crackles in a pungent ecstasy 

That seems half pain of death, and half a vast 

Triumphant exultation of release 

That its slow life-time of lethargic peace 

Should come to this wild rapture at the last. 

We watch it idly, and our casual speech 

Drops slowly into silence. 

Something stirs and struggles in me. 

Something out of reach 

Of surface thoughts, a slow and formless thing— 

Not I, but a dim memory 

Born of the dead behind me. In my blood 

The blind race turns, groping and faltering. 

Desires 

Only half glimpsed, not understood. 

Stir me and shake me. Fires 


Eunice Tietjens 

Answer the fire, and vague shapes pass 
Like shapes of wind across the grass. 

The red flames catch and lift. 

Roaring and sucking in a furious blaze; 

And a strange, swift 

Hunger for violence is in me. My blood pounds 

With a dark memory of age-old days, 

And mad red nights I never knew. 

When the dead in me lived, and horrid sounds 

Broke from their furry throats. 

In drunken rounds. 

Blood-crazed, they danced before the leaping flames, 

While something twisted in the fire. . . . 

Now as the flames mount higher 

Strange pictures pass. I cannot see them quite 

And yet I feel them. 

I am in a dread 
Dark temple, and I beat my head 
In maddened rite. 
Before the red-hot belly of a god 
Who eats his worshippers. . . . 

This is a funeral pyre 
And one lies dead 

Who was my life. The fat smoke curls and eddies. 
Beckoning suttee. . . . 

But the moment slips 
To Bacchanalian revels — quick hot lips 

And leaping limbs, lit by the glare 
Of human torches. . . . 

A sudden spark 

Goes crackling upward, followed by a shower; 

And I am in the hills, cool hills and dark. 

Primeval as the fire. The beacon flare 

Leaps in a roaring tower. 

Spattering in sparks among the stars 

Tales of wild wars. 

And on a distant crest 

Its mate makes answer. . . . 

But the embers gleam 

Like molten metal steaming at a forge. 

Where with rough jest 

Great lusty fellows 

Ply the roaring bellows, 

And clang the song of labor — and the dream 

Man builds in metal. . . . 

Now the red flame steadies. 
Softly and quietly it burns. 
Purring, and its embers wear 
A friendly and domestic air. 

This is the hearth-fire — home and peace at last. 
Comfort and safety are attendant here. 
The primal fear 
Is shut away, to whistle in the blast 


Eunice Tietjens 

Beyond the doorway where the shadows twine. 

The fire is safety, and the fire is home, 

Light, warmth and food. Here careless children come 

Filling the place with laughter; 

And after 

Men make good council-talk, and old men spin, 

With that great quiet of the wise. 

Tales of dead beauty, and of dying eyes. 

The fire is drooping now. A log falls in 

Softly upon itself, like one grown tired 

With ecstasy. The lithe tongues sink 

In ash and ember: 

And something I remember 

From ages gone — and yet I cannot think — 

Some secret of the end. 

Of earth grown old, and death turned friend, 

And man who passes 

Like flame, like light, like wind across the grasses. 

Ah, what was that? A sudden terror sped 
Behind me in the shadows. I am cold; 
And I should like your hand to hold 
Now that the fire is dead. 
Love, light the lamp, and come away to bed. 
Fire is a strange thing, burning in your head. 

Eunice Tietjens 


COMMENT 

THE UTTERANCE OF POETRY 

IN the Literary Review of a recent New York Evening 
Post Lawrence Mason tells whimsically of the tortures 
he has endured in hearing poetry read aloud. Listing 
"several different methods," he says: 

Some chant or intone it in a dulcet sing-song that woos reluctant 
slumber from her lair. Some attack it with athletic vigor, and pride 
themselves upon the sheer speed of their delivery. Others find the 
summum bonum in emphasizing the beat with the deadly regularity of 
a metronome. Still others coldly isolate and anatomize each line till 
there is no more savor in it than in a dried prune. Others, again, so 
boggle and halt and garble and apologize and re-read that the hearer 
is driven to madness, despair, or violent revolt. 

And he refers to a cousin "whose method is none of 
these — his sole and sufficient guiding principle is to con- 
ceal from his unfortunate hearers every evidence of 
versification." 

Mr. Mason's suffering reminds me of my own experience 
with a certain "eminent dramatic revelator" (so adver- 
tised) who for two seasons has given expensive recitals 
in Chicago under the alleged patronage of women of 
social prominence, of whom some, as I definitely ascer- 
tained, had never consented to the use of their names, 
and others had consented in a mistaken impulse of 
kindliness while in blessed ignorance of the man and 
his "art." The revelator, whose programs ranged from 
Othello to DeiuraUy followed the method of Mr. Mason's 


The Utterance of Poetry 

cousin, but enriched it with a kind of vocal gymnastics 
inherited from the elocutionary school of the eighteen- 
seventies. While the three-doUar-a-head audience sat 
in silence under the infliction, I amused myself, during 
the half-hour or so that a heroic sense of duty held me 
there, in certain speculations about the simple, but much 
abused art of reading poetry aloud. 

It would seem to be a rare gift — the beautiful reading 
of poetry. Even the poets themselves are often dis- 
appointing, though there is usually a degree of beauty 
and illumination to be gained from a poet's reading of his 
own verse. The poet instinctively emphasizes rhythm, 
sometimes even to the point of intoning or chanting it; 
indeed, he rarely carries this too far. But not all poets 
have good voices, an accent neither too local nor too 
studiedly correct, and a simple effective delivery. 

Certain poets, of course, it is a privilege to hear — their 
reading is as much a work of art as the poem, and the 
two fit together in indissoluble unity. I used to feel this 
of Lindsay, whose first reading of The Congo at Poetry's 
first banquet — in March, 1914 — was a triumph in the 
double art. But of late Lindsay has acquired bad habits 
— his reading has become too loud and melodramatic. 
John Masefield's very simple reading of his poems is 
beautiful beyond words, because of that marvellous bass 
voice of his, rich with all the sorrows of the world. Carl 
Sandburg also has a deep-toned organ in his throat which 
he uses with subtle simplicity in the proof of his delicate 

rhythms. The fine voice of William Butler Yeats is 
of higher pitch than these; his quiet intoning of poetry 
nobly illustrates its beauty. Lew Sarett's presentation 
of his Indian poems is their perfect and almost necessary 
completion. Robert Frost's personality and voice also 
fulfil and emphasize the quality of his poems. Witter 
Bynner has a rich voice and graceful delivery, but an 
over-precise utterance mars the effect of his reading 
for me. Alfred Kreymborg, Carlos Williams, .Maxwell 
Bodenheim — each of these complements his very per- 
sonal rhythm in the utterance of his poems. And Padraic 
Colum brings to us the authentic Celtic tune — he is 
even more of an Irishman than Mr. Yeats. 

I wish I could say as much for the women. Amy 
Lowell, Eunice Tietjens, Lola Ridge, Helen Hoyt, Mar- 
jorie SeifFert, Florence Frank, Jean Untermeycr — all these 
read well, some of them brilliantly; all simply, and in 
rhythmic fulfilment of their poems. But none of them 
with quite the artistic beauty which some of the men have 
attained. 

On the stage one rarely hears beautiful utterance of 
poetry. In all my unusual experience of theatricalized 
Shakespeare, which, beginning with Edwin Booth in 
my sixth year, includes almost every distinguished 
interpreter since his time, I have heard only one whose 
reading of the lines — no, not reading, not anything re- 
membered and recited — whose spontaneous utterance of 
the lines — seems to me of such perfection, such strange 


The Utterance of Poetry 

and consummate beauty, as to be forever memorable 
and — alas — incomparable. This was Ada Rehan: to 
hear her as Viola or Rosalind was to be moved by a voice, 
deep and rich like falling waters, which turned English 
words into speech-music of transcendent quality, music 
that moved one like Kubelik's violin or Isadora Duncan's 
dancing. 

Among women, Ellen Terry was perhaps Miss Rehan's 
closest rival; but her voice was not quite so bitter-sweet, 
and there was a slight jerkiness in her delivery which 
gave it vitality and picturesqueness but detracted from 
absolute music. Mary Anderson had a voice like a cello, 
of extraordinary richness and range, and a fine sense of 
poetic cadence; but her delivery, though beautiful, to be 
remembered always with joy, was more deliberate and 
studied, leaning more to the old rhetorical school. 

Booth was wonderful, of course — my youth shone with 
the romantic glamour of him. But it must be admitted 
that Booth mouthed his lines by overstressing his con- 
sonants, and that his delivery was not the spontaneous 
utterance of perfect art but the brilliant recital of speeches 
learned. He was a great artist of his Victorian time and 
his somewhat rhetorical school; but he was not an orig- 
inator, not one of the genius-illumined who strike out 
new times, new methods. 

Henry Irving had a more far-seeing mind, but his gift 
was for the spectacular. His speech was gusty and 
storm-ridden, his cadences churned and broken like a bold 

skifF outriding a gale. It was an adventure to listen to 
the lines of his Shylock — the poetry was so often in danger 
and so unexpectedly triumphant. He ranted early and 
often, but his ranting was always in the picture, always 
in the service of a deliberate conventionalization, a 
planned and achieved pattern. The modern poetic drama 
has scrapped his particular convention; but we may still 
envy him his skill, for we cannot yet claim to have estab- 
lished our own convention. 

If Booth and Irving ranted sometimes, Lawrence 
Barrett ranted always; and John McCullough was seldom 
above the temptation, although his robust blank verse 
had always a certain beauty of cadence. Richard 
Mansfield came in a time of more simple Thespian 
manners, but he broke up the lines, he had no sense of 
rhythm; whether in Henry Fifth or Beau Brummel^ he 
spoke always prose. Of all the male actors I have heard, 
Forbes-Robertson is the most assured master of poetic 
cadence; but his reading of Shakespeare, though beautiful, 
is sophisticated and deliberate — it lacks the spontaneity, 
and also the variety, which made Ada Rehan's, and even 
Ellen Terry's, a continual flaring of new fires. 

The Irish Players are rhythmically endowed beyond any 
other company of my remembrance; which is not strange, 
since Irish speech is musical with poetic cadence, and 
these players were trained by Synge and Yeats and Lady 
Gregory, the three poets who have used it to the highest 
poetic purpose. This beautiful rhythmic speech has been 


The Utterance of Poetry 

the secret of their charm, the one most potent reason for 
the effect of artistic unity and beauty in their rendition of 
the great plays of the Celtic renaissance. 

The subject has led me to reminiscence when inquiry 
was intended — we have lingered with the masters instead 
of seeking examples in common life. If few actors read 
poetry with due r^ard for the rhythm, still fewer public 
readers have any conception of the primary principles of 
the art they profess, even when they have freed themselves 
of the hideous old elocutionary tradition which deliber- 
ately destroyed poetic cadence, broke up the lines, and 
turned poetry into agonizing prose. 

This tradition is chiefly to blame for banishing from 
modern life an art which should be at least as common and 
friendly a pleasure and solace as music. A good voice, a 
sense of rhythm, simple unexaggerated utterance, all 
showing respect for the line and revealing the larger 
cadences which overlie the basic pattern — such a combina- 
tion may make the reading-aloud of poetry, in any house- 
hold or group of friends, a joy as fine as the excellent 
plajring of a musical instrument. 

More encouragement of this art might reveal and 
develop exceptional talent in persons scarcely aware of 
it. I remember an exquisite out-door presentation of 
Ernest Dowson's Pierrot of the Minute by two young 
sisters who had never realized their rare gift for the most 
delicate musical subtleties of poetic dialogue. And in the 
history department of the University of Chicago hides a 

certain modest professor whose reading of the Ode to a 
Nightingale gives his friends an experience as magnificent 
as Muratore ever oflfered with his proudest solo, or 
Paderewski in his palmiest days. 

The reading of poetry should be an easily accessible 
delight instead of the bore which it usually is. The defect 
chiefly to be avoided is a certain high-sounding rotundity 
which most people assume like a toga when they start to 
read poetry aloud. Most voices need training, to be sure, 
to develop the latent beauty in them; every school should 
teach the proper use of this delicate musical instrument 
within us. Given a good voice properly controlled, an 
ear for poetic rhythm, and the simplest possible observance 
of the pitches and tones of poetically enhanced speech, 
and you have the beginning of good reading of poetry — a 
beginning which practice, and the stimulus of emotional 
and imaginative intensity, may develop into high artistic 
beauty. H. A/. 

TRANSLATING WANG WEI 

Just as Tu Fu and Li Po are often spoken of in conjunc- 
tion by the Chinese, so are two other great poets of the 
T'ang Dynasty, Meng Hao-jan and Wang Wei. The 
latter, who lived 699-759 A. D., is distinguished among the 
poets of China by a deep and beautiful optimism. The 
melancholy that wounded Tu Fu and Meng Hao-jan 
seems not to have touched Wang Wei beneath the surface. 


Translating fVang Wei 

And, whereas Li Po sought in wine solace from the ills and 
sorrows of life, Wang Wei found an abiding content in the 
"green and healing hills" and in the highly humbled 
and attuned mysticism of Lao-tzu's teaching. 

As a young man, Wang Wei became Assistant Secretary 
of State; but at the age of thirty-one, when his wife died, 
he left his post and retired to live near Mount Chung-nan. 
Two of his poems about Mount Chung-nan are published 
in this number, both breathing the sober sweetness and 
simplicity of his retired life. One of them begins with the 
line, "My heart in middle age found the Way"; the 
Chinese word for the Way being Tao, the first character 
of the title of Lao-tzu's book, Tao-Te-Chingy which may 
be translated in whole as The Way and the Exemplification. 
Taoism appears, then, to have been the consolation of 
Wang Wei, although Professor Herbert JVf . Giles, in his 
volume Chinese Literature^ declares it to have been 
Buddhism. We realize, not only from the direct statement 
in this one poem, but from the spirit of all his poems, that 
he had serenely accepted the Way, the natural way of the 
universe. 

There was for a while a strong division between the 
followers of Lao-tzu and the followers of Confucius. Po 
Chu-yi ridiculed Taoist doctrines in the following four 
lines, crisply translated by Professor Giles: 

" Who know speak not, who speak know naught, " 

Are words from Lao-tzu's lore. 
What then becomes of Lao-tzu's own 
Five thousand words or more? 


 



0. 




 

The answer is that Lao-tzu's words, fused now with both 
Buddhism and Confucianism, have become an integral 
part of the religion of China. Here are two characteristic 
quotations from his gospel: 

Follow diligently the Way in your own heart, but make no display 
of it to the world. 

Do nothing, and all things will be done. 

Among the selections printed in this issue, note the last 
two lines of the poem, Answering Vice-Prefect Chang: a 
question asked in terms of complicated morality and 
answered in terms of simple happiness: 

You ask me about good and evil? 

Hark, on the lake there's a fisherman singing. 

This does not mean that the ideal Taoist literally ''did 
nothing." As a matter of fact Wang Wei was a physician, 
a high government official, a great poet, and also one of 
China's most illustrious painters. (A scroll attributed to 
him is on view at the Metropolitan Museum in New 
York.) His activities, however, were all in flow with 
universal forces: they sang like the fisherman — there was 
no fret, no jealousy, no self-exaltation, no irritated 
struggle; only harmony, humility, exalted identity with 
nature — a true and wide knowledge of values, making 
him a master of words, a master of the brush, and a 
master of life. Yes, there was a sure gaiety in Wang Wei, 
instanced in his Message to P*ai Ti^ the fellow-poet with 
whom he longed to drink again and to ''sing a wild 


Translating Wang Wei 

poem**; or in the verses already mentioned, My Retreat at 

Chung-nany in which he happily anticipated the day 

when he should "meet an old wood-cutter, and talk and 

laugh and never return." 

In the last two lines of the poem to P'ai Ti, he addressed 

his friend, according to a too frequent Chinese manner, by 

the name of Chieh-yu, who was a recluse of the Ch'u 

kingdom, famous somewhat for drinking, but more for 

stopping Confucius' chariot and warning him against 

politics with the song: 

O phoenix, O phoenix, 

Virtue is corrupted! 

What is past is past all counsel, 

What is future may be moulded. . . . 

G)me away! Come away! 

Politics are dangerous! 

And Wang Wei's reference in the final line of this same 
poem is to the place where he will be drinking with his 
friend; yet Five Willows is the place named, where long 
ago T'ao Ch'ien had lived, another . famous recluse who 
was both a great writer and a great drinker. 

The last two lines of the poem In my Lodge at Wang- 
CKuan after a Long Rain^ clear and significant as they are 
in themselves, yet contain, for the Chinese reader, enrich- 
ing allusion and connotation. There was once a scholar, 
Yang-tzu, who, before he became a student of Lao-tzu, 
was highly respected and honored by his fellow-men. 
Later, through the many years of his discipleship, he lost 
his prestige, and even a boor would take precedence over 

him; but he was glad because he had formerly been 
proud and pretentious. The last line refers to a hermit 
who was fond of sea-gulls; they followed him wherever he 
went. His father asked why they were not afraid and 
bade the son bring him some; but next day, when the 
hermit went out intending to take them to his father, 
they all flew away. 

The poem in the group most in need of explanation, 
because of its allusion to historic events and personages, 
is The Beautiful Hsi-shih; and the last two lines of 
A Song of Young Girls from Lo-Yang also require the 
following summary: 

During the Chou Dynasty, when the Yueh kingdom 
was conquered by the Wu kingdom, the Yueh king still 
held his throne and plotted to throw oflf the tributary 
yoke. Aided by his able minister, Fan Li, he planned to 
distract the king of Wu with women. Fan Li searched 
through the Yueh kingdom for girls to beguile him and 
came upon Hsi-shih washing clothes by a lake. Conquer- 
ing his own love for her, he fiercely persuaded her to his 
scheme. She remained at court for some time; and the 
Wu king, in his infatuation, forgot aflFairs of state. 
Weakened by this means, the Wu kingdom was overcome 
by the Yueh kingdom; and Fan Li eventually accepted 
Hsi-shih as his reward. The whimsical phrasing of the 
line "If by wrinkling their brows they can copy her 
beauty" alludes to the fact that she had heart trouble, 
and it was said, that her drawn brows, her look of gentle- 


Translating fVang Wei 

ness in suffering, which the girls of her time tried unsuc- 
cessfully to imitate, made her more beautiful. 

One might enlarge upon references in others of the 
poems. For instance, the quatrain called Lines contains 
the phrase "my silken window." This is not a decorative 
adjective. It merely means that, before the use of paper 
or glass, windows in China were of silk. The last line of 
the same poem is made lovelier by knowledge that the 
mei^ or plum blossom, is in China the earliest flower of 
spring. It is interesting to know that A Song at Wei- 
Chengy which was written for music, is still popular 
through China as a song of farewell, and that to this day 
"since we picked willow-branches at Wei-Cheng" means 
"since we parted." The beauty of the four lines called 
A Partingy with its simple, profound expression of the 
abiding presence of friendly nature and the transient 
presence of friendly man, is heightened by the reader's 
response to the grace of the name Wang Sun, which from 
a dim and ancient origin still means in China a noble- 
hearted young scholar, or sometimes lover. But on the 
whole, these T'ang poems are so valid and universal in 
uttering beauty that they may vitally enter the poetic 
consciousness of a westerner still ignorant of the various 
allusions. 

Translating the work of Wang Wei and others in the 
Three Hundred Poems of the Vang Dynasty ^ Dr. Kiang and 
I have tried constantly to transfer the Chinese idiom into 
an equivalent idiom in English, rather than to stress the 

local novelty and pungency of Chinese phrasing. It 
would be as erroneous to overemphasize the component 
radicals of a Chinese character as to overemphasize the 
component meanings of such words in English as day- 
break, breakfast, nightfall or landscape. The delicate 
importance of the translator's office lies in bringing from 
one language to another the rounded and proportioned 
effect of a whole poem. And we, conscientiously, have 
tried to make felt, in our translations, the high honesty 
and wise humanness of poets who have in many ways, and 
in one Wei especially, lived closer to the heart of life than 
importunate passion brings the poets of the West. 

Witter Bynner 

Aote by the Editor: Mr. Bynner s preference for the line of four feet 
and for the four-line or eight-line poem is his tribute to the close prosodic 
structure of Chinese poetry. In the translator's opinion the form he 
has chosen is the closest approach to the original which is possible in 
English. 

REVIEWS 

A COOL MASTER 

Collected Poems of Edwin Arlington Robinson (with por- 
trait frontispiece). Macmillan Co. 
Near the middle of the last century, Ralph Waldo 
Emerson, a sentimental philosopher with a genius for 
a sudden twisted hardness of words, wrote lines like: 

Daughters of Time, the hypocritic days, 
Muffled and dumb like barefoot dervishes, 


A Cool Master 

And marching single in an endless file. 
Bring diadems and fagots in their hands. 

And It was with Emerson that American poetry may be 
said to have begun. 'He was slight enough, but at his 
best a master, and above all a master of sound. And he 
began a tradition that still exists. 

He was followed shortly by Emily Dickinson, a master 
of a certain dowdy but undeniably effective mannerism, 
a spinster who may have written her poems to keep time 
with her broom. A terrible woman, who annihilated God 
as if He were her neighbor, and her neighbor as if he were 
God — all with a leaf or a sunbeam that chanced to fall 
within her sight as she looked out the window or the door 
during a pause in her sweeping: 

And we, we placed the hair, 
And drew the head erect; 
And then an awful leisure was, 
Our faith to regulate. 

The woman at her most terrible had the majesty of an 
erect corpse, a prophet of unspeakable doom; and she 
spoke through sealed lips. She was greater than Emerson, 
was one of the greatest poets of our language, but was 
more or less in the tradition that Emerson began. She 
and Emerson were probably the only poets of any per- 
manently great importance who occurred in this country 
during their period. 

The tradition of New England hardness has been 
carried on by Mr. Robinson, in many ways may be said 

[279I 




 

to have reached its pinnacle in Mr. Robinson. This poet, 
with a wider culture than his predecessors, has linked a 
suavity of manner to an even greater desperation than 
that of Dickinson's The Last Night — his hardness has 
become a polished stoniness of vision, of mind. 

This man has the culture to know that to those to 
whom philosophy is comprehensible it is not a matter of 
the first importance; and he knows that these people are 
not greatly impressed by a ballyhoo statement of the 
principles of social or spiritual salvation. A few times he 
has given his opinion, but quietly and intelligently, and 
has then passed on to other things. A man's philosophical 
belief or attitude is certain to be an important part of his 
milieu, and as a part of his milieu may give rise to percep- 
tions, images. His philosophy becomes a part of his life 
as does the country in which he was born, and will tinge 
his vision of the country in which he was born as that 
country may aflfect his philosophy. So long as he gives 
us his own perceptions as they arise in this milieu, he re- 
mains an artist. When he becomes more interested in 
the possible eflfects of his beliefs upon others, and expounds 
or persuades, he begins to deal with generalities, concepts 
(see][Croce), and becomes a philosopher, or more than 
likely a preacher, a mere peddler. This was the fallacy of 
Whitman and many of the English Victorians, and this 
is what invalidates nearly all of Whitman's work. Such 
men forget that it is only the particular, the perception, 
that is perpetually startling. The generality, or concept, 


A Cool Master 

can be pigeon-holed, absorbed, and forgotten. And a 
ballyhoo statement of a concept is seldom a concise one — 
it is neither fish nor flesh. That is why Whitman is 
doomed to an eventual dull vacuum that the intricately 
delicate mind of Plato will never know. 

Much praise has fallen to Mr. Robinson because he 
deals with people, "humanity"; and this is a fallacy of 
inaccurate brains. Humanity is simply Mr. Robinson's 
physical milieu; the thing, the compound of the things, he 
sees. It is not the material that makes a poem great, but 
the perception and organization of that material. A 
pigeon's wing may make as great an image as a man's 
tragedy, and in the poetry of Mr. Wallace Stevens has 
done so. Mr. Robinson's greatness lies not in the people 
of whom he has written, but in the perfect balance, the 
infallible precision, with which he has stated their cases. 

Mr. Robinson's work may be classified roughly in two 
groups — his blank verse, and his more closely rhymed 
poems, including the sonnets. Of his blank verse, the 
Octaves in The Children of the Night fall curiously into a 
group by themselves, and will be considered elsewhere in 
this review. The other poems in blank verse may be 
called sketches — some of people the poet may have known, 
some of historical figures, some of l^endary — and they 
have all the evanescence, brittleness, of sketches. How- 
ever, there are passages in many of these poems that an- 
ticipate Robert Frost, who in at least one poem. An Old 
Man*s fFinter Nighty has used this method with greater 

effect than its innovator, and has created a great poem. 

Mr. Frost, of course, leaves more of the bark on his 

rhythms, achieves a sort of implied colloquialism which 

has already been too much discussed. But with Frost in 

mind, consider this passage from Isaac and Archibald: 

A journey that I made one afternoon 
With Isaac to find out what Archibald 
Was doing with his oats. It was high time 
Those oats were cut, said Isaac; and he feared 
That Archibald — well, he could never feel 
Quite sure of Archibald. Accordingly 
The good old man invited me — that is. 
Permitted me — to go along with him; 
And I, with a small boy's adhesiveness 
To competent old age, got up and went. 

The similarity to Frost is marked, as is also the pleasing 
but not profound quality of the verse. It has a distinc- 
tion, however, that many contemporaries — French as well 
as English and American — could acquire to good advan- 
tage. 

Ben Jonson Entertains a Man from Stratford^ a much 
praised poem, seems largely garrulous, occasionally 
brilliant, and always brittle; and one can go on making 
very similar comments on the other poems in this form, 
until one comes to those alternately praised and lamented 
poems. Merlin and Lancelot. Remembering Tennyson, 
one's first inclination is to name these poems great, and 
certainly they are not inconsiderable. But there are 
long passages of purely literary frittering, and passages 
that, while they may possess a certain clean distinction of 


A Cool Master 

manner, are dry and unremunerative enough. But there 
are passages in these poems which are finer than any other 
blank verse Mr. Robinson has written — dark, massive 
lines that rise out of the poem and leave one bitter and 
empty: 

On Dagonet the silent hand of Merlin 
Weighed now as Kving iron that held him down 
With a primeval power. Doubt, wonderment. 
Impatience, and a self-accusing sorrow 
Born of an ancient love, possessed and held him 
Until his love was more than he could name, 
And he was Merlin's fool, not Arthur's now: 
"Say what you will, I say that I'm the fool 
Of Merlin, King of Nowhere; which is Here. 
With you for king and me for court, what else 
Have we to sigh for but a place to sleep?" 

But passing on from this less important side of Mr. 
Robinson's work to his rhymed poems, one finds at least 
a large number of perfectly executed poems of a sensitive 
and feline approach. What eflFect rhyme, or the intention 
of rhyme, has upon an artist's product, is a difficult thing 
to estimate. The question verges almost upon the 
metaphysical. The artist, creating, lives at a point of 
intensity, and whether the material is consciously digested 
before that point is reached, and is simply organized and 
set down at the time of creation; or whether the point of 
intensity is first reached and the material then drawn out 
of the subconscious, doubtless depends a good deal on the 
individual poet, perhaps on the individual poem. The 
latter method presupposes a great deal of previous 


absorption of sense impressions, and is probably the more 
valid, or at least the more generally efFective, method. 
For the rhythm and the "matter," as they come into 
being simultaneously and interdependent, will be perfectly 
fused and without loose ends. The man who comes to a 
form with a definitely outlined matter, will, more than 
likely, have to cram or fill before he has finished, and the 
result is broken. The second method does not, of course, 
presuppose rhyme, but it seems that rhyme, as an obstacle, 
will force the issue. 

The best of Mr. Robinson's poems appear to have 
come into being very much in this second fashion. He 
has spun his images out of a world of sense and thought 
that have been a part of him so long that he seems to 
have forgot their beginning — has spun these images out 
as the movement of his lines, the recurrence of his rhymes, 
have demanded them. A basic philosophy and emotional 
viewpoint have provided the necessary unity. 

This method inevitably focuses the artist's mind upon 
the object of the instant, makes it one with that object, 
and eliminates practically all individual "personality" or 
self-consciousness. The so-called personal touch is reduced 
to a minimum of technical habit that is bound to accrue in 
time to any poet who studies his medium with an eye to 
his individual needs. The man of some intelligence who 
cannot, or can seldom, achieve this condition of fusion 
with his object, is driven back to his ingenuity; and this 
man, if he have sufficient intelligence or ingenuity, 


A Cool Master 

becomes one of the "vigorous personalities" of poetry; 
and he misses poetry exactly in so far as his personality is 
vigorous. Browning, on two or three occasions one of 
the greatest of all poets, is, for the most part, simply the 
greatest of ingenious versifiers. He was so curious of the 
quirks with which he could approach an object, that he 
forgot the object in admiring, and expecting admiration 
for, himself. And it is for this reason that Mr. Robinson, 
working in more or less the same field as Browning, is the 
superior of Browning at almost every turn. 

And it is for this reason also that Mr. Robinson's Ben 
Jonson is a failure. For the poet, while in no wise con- 
cerned with his own personality, is so intent upon the 
personality of Jonson, his speaker, that, for the sake of 
Jonson*s vigor, he becomes talkative and eager of identify- 
ing mannerism; and the result is, that Shakespeare, about 
whom the poem is written, comes to the surface only here 
and there, and any actual image almost never. 

The following stanza is an example of Mr. Robinson's 

work at its best: 

And like a giant haq> that hums 
On always, and is always blending 
The coming of what never comes 
With what has past and had an ending, 
The City trembles, throbs, and poundhs 
Outside, and through a thousand sounds 
The small intolerable drums 
Of Time are like slow drops descending. 

And there is the compact, intensely contemplated state- 
ment of Eros TurannoSy a poem that is, in forty-eight 

lines> as complete as a Lawrence novel. And the nimble 
trickery of Miniver Cheevey^ as finished a piece of bur- 
lesque as one can find in English. A few of us have 
feared, in the last few years, that Mr. Robinson was 
deteriorating; but going through this book one is reas- 
sured. If there is nothing in The Three Taverns to equal 
Eros TurannoSy there are at least two or three poems as 
great as any save that one Mr. Robinson has written; and 
there is nothing in these last poems to preclude the 
possibility of another Eros Turannos. 

Mr. Robinson, as probably the highest point in his 
tradition, has been followed by Frost, a more specialized, 
and generally softer artist. And there is Gould, who, if 
he belongs to the tradition at all, is a mere breaking-up of 
the tradition, a fusion with Whitman. But in considering 
the work of a man of so varied a genius as Mr. Robinson, 
it is interesting, if not over-important, to observe the 
modes of expression that he has anticipated if not actually 
influenced; even where he has not chosen, or has not been 
able to develop, these modes. 

The resemblance in matter and manner, save for Mr. 
Robinson's greater suavity, of certain poems, especially 
the sonnets, in The Children of the Nighty to the epitaphs in 
The Spoon River Anthology y has been noted by other 
writers; and I believe it has been said that Mr. Masters 
was ignorant of the existence of these poems until after 
the Anthology was written. There is little to be said about 
such a poem as Mr. Robinson's Luke Havergal: 


A Cool Master 

No, there is not a dawn in eastern skies 
To rift the fiery night that's in your eyes; 
But there, where western glooms are gathering, 
The dark will end the dark, if anything: 
God slays Himself with every leaf that flies. 
And hell is more than half of paradise. 
No, there is not a dawn in eastern skies — 
In eastern skies. 

Out of a grave I come to tell you this. 
Out of a grave I come to quench the kiss 
That flames upon your forehead with a glow 
That blinds you to the way that you must go. 

And Mr. Masters' satire has been forestalled and outdone 

in these early sonnets. 

But a more curious and interesting resemblance to a 

later poet is found in the Octaves in the same volume: 

To me the groaning of world-worshippers 
Rings like a lonely music played in hell 
By one with art enough to cleave the walls 
Of heaven with his cadence, but without 
The wisdom or the will to comprehend 
The strangeness of his own perversity. 
And all without the courage to deny 
The profit and the pride of his defeat. 

If the actual thought of this passage is not that of Wallace 
Stevens, nevertheless the quality of the thought, the 
manner of thinking, as well as the style, quite definitely is. 
To what extent Mr. Robinson may have influenced this 
greatest of living and of American poets, one cannot say, 
but in at least three of the Octaves^ one phase of Mr. 
Stevens* later work — that of Le Monocle de Mon Oncle 
and other recent and shorter poems — is certainly fore- 

shadowed. Mr. Robinson's sound is inevitably the less 
rich, the less masterly. 

In another of the Octaves there are a few lines that 
suggest the earlier poems of Mr. T. S. Eliot, but the resem- 
blance is fleeting and apparently accidental. 

If the tradition of New England seems to be reaching 
an end in the work of Mr. Frost, Mr. Robinson has at 
least helped greatly in the founding of a tradition of 
culture and clean workmanship that such poets as Messrs. 
Stevens, Eliot, and Pound, as H. D. and Marianne 
Moore, are carrying on. Mr. Robinson was, when he 
began, as much a pioneer as Mr. Pound or Mr. Yeats, 
and he has certainly achieved as great poetry. While the 
tradition begun, more or less, by Whitman, has deterio- 
rated, in. the later work of Mr. Carl Sandburg, into a sort 
of plasmodial delirium; and while the school of mellifluous 
and almost ominous stage-trappings, as exemplified by 
Poe, has melted into a sort of post-Celtic twilight, and 
has nearly vanished in the work of Mr. Aiken; the work 
of these writers and a few others stands out clear and hard 
in the half-light of our culture. I cannot forget that they 
exist, even in the face of the desert. Yvor fVinters 

MR. VEATS' PLAYS 

Four Plays for Dancers^ by William Butler Yeats. Mac- 

millan Co. 

Mr. Yeats is one of the few poets writing poetic plays 
who are also, in exact meaning, men of the theatre. Just 


Mr. Yeats* Plays 

as he is probably the foremost poet of his generation, so 
he shares with Gordon Craig and one or two others the 
distinction of having seen furthest into the theatre as it 
may become. That youth which in the Irish temperament 
is so old as to be imperishable has retained for him his 
leadership in the poetic drama and in the exploration of 
new forms. Four Plays /or Dancers y as in its own time 
The Land of Hearths Desire (written "without adequate 
knowledge of the stage"!), is the work of a pioneer bring- 
ing a form to its perfection with no apparent interval of 
apprenticeship. 

"My blunder has been," he writes, "that I did not 
discover in my youth that my theatre must be the ancient 
theatre that can be made by unrolling a carpet, or marking 
out a place with a stick, or setting a screen against a 
wall." When he was last in America he told us of such a 
theatre, so intimate that its few properties could be 
carried by the players in a taxicab and set in a drawing- 
room, and of how he had found a first model in the Noh 
stage of aristocratic Japan. Shortly afterward The Only 
Jealousy of Emer was published in Poetry; and now, 
with three other plays similar in construction, it appears 
in book form. There are also masks and costume plates 
by Edmond Dulac for At the Hawk^s Well^ produced as 
early as 1916 in England, music for the dances and songs 
by W. M. Rummel, and suggestive notes on the plays and 
their production. 

Unhesitatingly one may call this book the most signifi- 

cant contribution to the art-theatre that has been written 
in a long while. True, it is the art-theatre in its most 
aristocratic phase; but the best in this art, as in another, 
must sometimes, in relation to audiences, be aristocratic. 
What gives to these plays their significance, apart from 
the almost ineffable beauty with which at least two of 
them are written, is that he has found a way by which the 
color, the enchantment, the distance and subtlety of 
legendary drama may be projected intimately and by a 
medium of amazing simplicity. In doing this, granting 
that one's insight into the effect of the plays in production 
is accurate, he has conquered difficulties which would 
seem insurmountable. 

He has secured the illusion of distance, not in despite 
of, but through^ the intimacy of a small audience in contact 
with the players. Never before in the western theatre, 
and in no other western art except perhaps that of the 
story-teller setting his tale directly in the imagination, has 
such an effect been possible. It is the quality of his tech- 
nique, the unerring sense of the theatre, which seems to 
make this an authentic form both in these individual 
plays and as existing apart from them. Beside it the arti- 
ficial intimacy effected by Max Reinhardt becomes clap- 
trap. Restricting himself to the simplest means, he has 
chosen them with the instinct of a poet, with that same 
instinct which made such lines as these of the Musician: 
I call to the eye of the mind 
A well long choked up and dry. 
And boughs long stripped by the wind. 


Mr. Yeats' Plays 

And I call to the mind's eye 

Pallor of an ivory face. 

Its lofty dissolute air, 

A man climbing up to a place 

The salt sea wind has swept bare. 

"In literature if we would not be parvenus we must have 
a model;" and as his theatre has been modified until it 
has become independent of the Nohy so a new poetic 
drama may be liberated by his inspiration. 

As for the plays in relation to each other, we have 
learned long since to expect in the work of Mr. Yeats 
the clarity and beauty of poetic content and expression 
that one finds in these plays. We expect it; and it seldom 
fails the anticipation. If The Dreaming of the Bones and 
Calvary do not seem quite to reach the height of the 
two others, that is not to deny that they are rich in con- 
tent also. But there is a beauty lacking in them, purity 
of inspiration replaced by what is not far from propa- 
ganda in the one and from an over-subtle interpretation 
in the other. The mood has flagged somewhat, after the 
splendor of utterance in At the Hawk's Well and The 
Only Jealousy of Enter. These are incomparable. 

Postcript—to ''Little Theatres'": These plays, when 
you read them, may not appear diflicult to present, what 
with the elaborate stage directions and the photographs. 
But I fear that you would find them impossible, lacking 
a Yeats, a Dulac, and a Michio Itow, who are indispen- 
sable. And it would be a mistake to confuse this theatre 

in any way with the theatre of Jacques G>peau, which is 
also admirable. Mr. Yeats has not abandoned the mise 
en scene — he has intensified it. And, incidentally, he has 
given us, when we are ready for it, one kind of synthetic 
theatre, including even the management of light.

Keep up with the times— read POETRY 



The New York Sunday Tribune of Jan. 0h, ig2i, said edUoriaUy, 
m quoting seven poems from our January number: 

**Thc varied interest and beauty presented are typical of 
Poetry's quality. Thanks to a rare coincidence of poise and gener- 
ous imagination, of sense and sensitiveness, it ranks asr easfly the best 
vehicle of poetry in the English language." 

In the London Times of Nov, 2Sth, 1920, we read: 

«We need not linger over the many English and French con- 
tributors to this periodical. . . We do have to note that it has 
published, as it honestly claims, much of the best experimental 
poetry written by Americans in the past eight years. . . They have 
succeeded in their primary design— te create a poetry which should 
be American in thought, feeling, subject, and form. That is, after 
all, a distinct achievement.** 

The Chicago Evening Post, in commenting on POETRY'S eighth 
birthday, said: 

''No editorship is infallible, but it is rather interesting and 
enlightening to look over the old numbers of Poetry and to realize 
that the first important diance for publication in America was given 
to many poets, almost unknown, who have since obtained fome. . . 
We wonder how many more may yet be helped. Poetry is, so far 
as we know, unique in the length of its life, recognized position and 
rigorously artistic standard."

MEDLEY OF POEMS 

MOON-RIDERS 

I 

WHAT have I saved out of a morning? 
The earliest of the morning came with moon-mist 
And the travel of a moon-spilt purple: 
Bars, horse-shoes, Texas long-horns. 
Linked in night silver. 
Linked under leaves in moonlit silver. 
Linked in rags and patches 
Out of the ice-houses of the morning moon. 
Yes, this was the earliest — 
Before the cowpunchers on the eastern rims 
Began riding into the sun, 
Riding the roan mustangs of morning, 

Roping the mavericks after the latest stars. 
What have I saved out of a morning? 
Was there a child face I saw once 
Smiling up a stairway of the morning moon? 

II 

"It is time for work/' said a man in the morning. 
He opened the faces of the clocks, saw their works. 
Saw the wheels oiled and fitted, running smooth. 
"It is time to begin a day's work," he s^d again. 
Watching a bullfinch hop on the rain-worn boards 
Of a beaten fence counting its bitter winters. 
The clinging feet of the bullfinch and the flash 
Of its flying feathers as it flipped away 
Took his eyes away from the clocks — his flying eyes. 
He walked over, stood in front of the clocks again. 
And said, "I'm sorry; I apologize forty ways." 

Ill 

The morning paper lay bundled. 

Like a spear in a museum, 

Across the broken sleeping-room 

Of a moon-sheet spider. 

The spinning work of the morning spider's feet 

Left off where the morning paper's pages lay 

In the shine of the web in the summer-dew grass. 

The man opened the morning paper: saw the first page, 


Carl Sandburg 

The back page, the inside pages, the editorials; 

Saw the world go by, eating, stealing, fighting; 

Saw the headlines, date-lines, funnies, ads. 

The marching movies of the workmen going to work, the 

workmen striking. 
The workmen asking jobs — five million pairs of eyes look 

for a boss and say, "Take me*'\ 
People eating with too much to eat, people eating with 

nothing in sight to eat tomorrow, eating as though 

eating belongs where people belong. 

"Hustle, you hustlers, while the bustling's good," 
Said the man, turning the morning paper's pages. 
Turning among headlines, date-lines, funnies, ads. 
"Hustlers carrying the banner," said the man. 
Dropping the paper and beginning to hunt the city; 
Hunting the alleys, boulevards, back-door by-ways; 
Hunting till he found a blind horse dying alone. 
Telling the horse, "Two legs or four legs — it's all the same 
with a work plug." 

A hayfield mist of evening saw him 
Watching the moon-riders lose th^ moon 
For new shooting-stars. He asked, 
"Christ, what have I saved out of a morning?" 
He called up a stairway of the morning moon 
And he remembered a child face smiling up that same 
stairway. 

FEATHER LIGHTS 

Macabre and golden the moon opened a slant of light. 

A triangle for an oriole to stand and sing, "Take me 
home." 

A layer of thin white gold feathers for a child queen of 
gypsies. 

So the moon opened a slant of light and let it go. 

So the lonesome dogs, the fog moon, the pearl mist, came 
back. 

THE NAKED STRANGER 

It is five months off. 
Knit, stitch, and hemstitch: 
Sheets, bags, towels, these are the offerings. 
When he is older, or she is a big girl. 
There may be flowers or ribbons or money 
For birthday offerings. Now, however. 
We must remember it is a naked stranger 
Coming to us; and the sheath of the arrival 
Is so soft we must be ready, and soft too. 

Knit, stitch, hemstitch, it is only five months. 



It would be easy to pick a lucky star for this baby 
If a choice of two stars lay before our eyes — 


Carl Sandhirg 



One a pearl-gold star and one pearl-silver — 
And the ofFer of a chance to pick a lucky star. 

When the high hour comes 

Let there be a light flurry of snow, 

A little zigzag of white spots 

Agunst the gray roofs. 
The snow*born all understand this as a luck-wish. 



MEDLEY 

Ignorance came in stones of gold; 
The ignorant slept while the hangmen 
Hanged the keepers of the lights 
Of sweet stars: such were the apothegms. 
Offhand offerings of mule-drivers 
Eating sandwiches of rye bread, 
Salami and onions. 

"Too Many Books," we always called him; 

A landscape of masterpieces and old favorites 

Fished with their titles for his eyes 

In the upstairs and downstairs rooms 

Of his house. Whenever he passed 

The old-time bar-room where Pete Morehouse 

Shot the chief of police, where 

The sponge squads shot two bootleggers, 

[299I 




 

He always remembered the verse story. 
The Face on the Bar-room Floor — 
, The tramp on a winter night. 
Saddened and warmed with whiskey, 
Telling of a woman he wanted 
And a woman who wanted him, 
How whiskey wrecked it all; 
Taking a piece of chalk. 
Picturing her face on the bar-room floor. 
Fixing the lines of her face 
While he told the story. 

Then gasping and falling with finished heartbeats. 
Dead. 

And whenever he passed over the bridge at night 

And took the look up the river to smaller bridges. 

Barge lights, and looming shores. 

He always thought of Edgar Allan Poe, 

With a load of hootch in him. 

Going to a party of respectable people 

Who called for a speech. 

Who listened to Poe recite the Lord's Prayer, 

Correctly, word for word, yet with lush, unmistakable 

Intonations, so haunting the dinner-party people 

All excused themselves to each other. 

Whenever Too Many Books 

Passed over the town bridge in the gloaming, 


Carl Sandburg 

He thought of Poe breaking up that party 

Of respectable people. Such was Too Many Books — 

We called him that. 



GYPSY MOTHER 

In a hole-in-a-wall on Halsted Street sits a gypsy woman^ 
In a garish, gas-lit rendezvous, in a humpback higgling 
hole-in-a-wall. 

The left hand is a tattler; stars and oaths and alphabets 
Commit themselves and tell happenings gone, happenings 
to come, pathways of honest people, hypocrites. 

"Long pointed fingers mean imagination;' a star on the 
third finger says a black shadow walks near.'' 

Cross the gypsy's hand with fifty cents, and she takes your 
left hand and reads how you shall be happy in love, 
or not, and whether you die rich, or not. 

Signs outside the hole-in-a-wall say so, misspell the 
promises, scrawl the superior gypsy mysteries. 

A red shawl on her shoulders falls with a fringe hem to a 

green skirt. 
Chains of yellow beads sweep from her neck to her tawny 

hands. 
Fifty springtimes must have kissed her mouth holding a 

calabash pipe. 

She pulls slow contemplative pufFs of smoke. She is a 
shape for ghosts of contemplation to sit around and 
ask why something cheap as happiness is here; and 
more besides than plain happiness, chapped lips, 
rough eyes, red shawl, gypsy perfection of offhand 
insolence. 

She is thinking about somebody and something — the same 
as Whistler's mother sat and thought about some- 
body and something. 

In a hole-in-a-wall on Halsted Street are stars, oaths, 
alphabets. 

Carl Sandburg 




SONG SKETCHES 

WE HAVE A DAY 

We have a day, we have a night 
Which have been made for our delight I 

Shall we run, and run, and run 
Up the path of the rising sun? 

Shall we roll down every hill, 

Or lie still 

Listening while the whispering leaves 

Promise what no one believes? 

(The hours poise, breathless for flight, and bright.) 

Only a night, only a day — 

We must not let them get away: 

Don a foolish cap and bell. 
For all is well and all is well! 

Dance through woods a purple-blue! 
Dance into 

Lanes that are a hidden stem 
Beneath the beauty over them. 

(The hours lift their shadow-form, are warm.) 
Why do you still stand mute and white? 
The day is past, but there is night. 

Turn your head, give me your lips — 
The darkness slips! The darkness slips. 

We could make it hushed and still. 
If you will 

We could hear, close to the ground 
Life — the one authentic sound. 

(The hours, as a startled faun, are gone.) 



SPRING MORNING 

O day — if I could cup my hands and drink of you. 

And make this shining wonder be 

A part of me! 

Oday! Oday! 

You lift and sway your colors on the sky 

Till I am crushed with beauty. Why is there 

More of reeling sunlit air 

Than I can breathe? Why is there sound 

In silence? Why is a singing wound 

About each hour? 

And perfurne when there is no flower? 

O day! O day! How may I press 

Nearer to loveliness? 


Marion Strobel 

TONIGHT 

A flame 
Leaps high 
In a wind: 

I am the same. 

I go 

My head 
High. I flame 

Red— blue. Oh, 

Tonight 
The sky 
Will be a 

Cry of light — 

Fire! 

G)me swift 
As wind — come, 

Lift me higher! 

THE SILENCE STIRS AGAIN 

The silence that has lain so long between us 

Stirs again: 

The rushes bend in shining pathways 

To the shining end; 

The air is burdened with the rose that is not there — 

Always the rose. 

I have no laughter now, no tears — 
Only the silence grows big with years, 
Only the silence has a touch 
That hurts overmuch. 

The rushes bend 

In shining pathways to the shining end; 

Bend, and close. 



THE NIGHT 

The night binds darkness round my eyes 

And makes me wise. 

The quiet hours beguile — 

Like m^dens chaste in single file, 

Like maidens who have said, 

"Be comforted." 

The truth of day falls far away 

And far away • . . 

And all the little gaieties 

Are dressed in colors as I please; 

And sadness has a gentle hand 

I understand. 

The night bound darkness round my eyes- 
I was made wise. 


Marion Strobei 



I WOULD PRETEND 



Now that between us there is nothing more 
To say, I would have loud and foolish speech 
With you, I would pretend I still adore 
Your voice: "Come, beautiful, draw near and teach 
The way my hands should go in a caress — 
Should fingers trail as pink feet of a crane 
That skim the water? — or should fingers press 
Their weight heavily?" Draw near me again — 
What docs it matter if the words you say 
Are lies, if they be sweet to listen to? 
Your lips are quite as cruel, quite as gay 
As ever; and your eyes are honest blue. . . . 
Oh, be sublimely false (who are not true) — 
And rU pretend I love you ... as I do! 



ADMONITION 

Come quietly, without a word — 
I am so tired of the things Fve heard. 
I am so tired of words that tear 
At beauty till the branch is bare: 

Of words that will not let beauty be 

A sweet-clustered mystery. 

As a Canterbury bell 

Purse your lips, but do not tell. 

FRIGHTENED FACE 

Child of the frightened face, 

Trying to understand 
Thelittleibitoflove 

Under your hand, 

Holding the little love 

Under fingers that crush 
That which is soft as the 

Throat of a thrush. 

Holding your hand upon 

The wonder of the thing, 
Crushing out the song that 

Wanted to sing: 

Child of the frightened face, 

Why do your fingers try 
To kill the little love? 

Soon it would die. 



DAILY PRAYER 

And at last when I go 
WiU it be so? 
Shall I find you behihd 
The rude platitude of death? 

t3o8] 



 



Marion Strobel 



I kneel within the certainty 

That you are near to me: 

Each day I pray 

That I may follow through 

To you. 

Each day I pray. 



L ENVOI 

The moments reach and touch the hours gently. 

Each is kind. 

Each is soothing as the tips 

Of fingers held to lips. 

The moments reach and touch the hours: flowers 
Wt1\ bloom, again, 

And I shall pick fresh jonquils for the room; 
And I shall pick fresh jonquils in the usual way 
Every day. 

The moments reach and touch the hours: 
Time has no beginning, and no end. 
Dear friend. 

Marion Strobel 


WORKING.HOUR SONGS 

THE SHOE FACTORY 

Song of the knotty er 

They told me 

When I came 
That this would be drudgery, 

Always the same 
Thing over and over 

Day after day — 
The same swift movement 

In the same small way. 

Pick upy 
Place, 
Push, 
And ifs tied. 
Take off. 
Cut, 
And put 
It aside. 

Over and over 

In rhythmical beat — 
Some say it is drudgery 

But to me it is sweet. 


Ruth Harwood 



Pick upy 
Place, 
Push, 
And it's tied. 
Outdoors 
The sky 
Is so blue 
And so wide! 

It's a joyous song 
Going steadily on, 

Marching in measures 
Till the day is gone. 

Pick upy 
Place, 
Push, 
And it's tied. 
Soon end 
Of day 
Will bring him 
To my side. 

Oh, I love the measures 

Singing so fast. 
Speeding happy hours 

Till he comes at last! 

MAKING LITTLE CLOTHES 

Grey rain on the window-pane> 
And in my heart grey rain — 

And the ceaseless whir of machines 
Pounding my weary brain. 

He had such a little share of life^ 

And now he*s gone. 
And all my heart went with him. 

Yet I go numbly on^ 
Making little clothes 

Just the size of him^ 
Little clothes for others 

But nevermore for him. 

Grey rain on the window-pane, 
And in my heart grey rain — 

And the endless grind of machines 
Beating a dull refrain. 

ALWAYS AND ALWAYS 

Always and always 

I go out from myself 

In the silver morning, 

Out to greet some new friend, 

With my arms laden with friendship gifts 

And a hundred little songs of gladness on my lips. 


Ruth Hartvood 

Always and always 

I return to myself 

In the purple twilight — 

Back to the comforting sureness of myself. 

To fill my empty arms again with gifts, 

To ease the little hurt my heart has brought. 

Ruth Harwood 



THE UNLOVED 

Stephen, son of me. 

You will never be born, my dear. 
Light of day you will never see. 

And the earth-sounds never hear. 

But after I have died. 

When I come to the courts of the sun — 
Though husband-love I have never had. 

And lovers never a one — 

You will stand with a ripple of joy 
On the lips that have never smiled. 

And I shall clasp, my son at last — 
My child, my child! 

Alison Buchanan 


ECCLESIASTES 

In the smoke-blue cabaret 

She sang some comic thing: 
I heeded not at all 

TiU "Sing!" she cried, "Sing!" 
So I sang in tune with her 

The only song I know: 
"The doors shall be shut in the streets, 

And the daughters of music brought low.' 

Her eyes and working lips 

Gleamed through the cruddled air — 
I tried to sing with her 

Her song of devil-may-care. 
But in the shouted chorus 

My lips would not be stilled: 
"The rivers run into the sea. 

Yet the sea is not filled." 

Then one came to my table 

Who said, with a laughing glance, 
"If that is the way you sing, 

Why don't you learn to dance?" 
But I said: "With this one song 

My heart and lips are cumbered — 
'The crooked cannot be made straight. 

Nor that which is wanting, numbered.* 


Morris Bishop 



"This song must I sing, 

Whatever else I covet — 
Hear the end of my song, 

Hear the beginning of it: 
'More bitter than death the woman 

(Beside me still she stands) 
Whose heart is snares and nets, 

And whose hands are bands.'" 



A NEW HAMPSHIRE BOY 

Under Monadnock, 

Fold on fold. 
The world's fat kingdoms 

Lie unrolled. 

Far in the blue south 
City-smoke, swirled, 

Marks the dwellings 
Of the kings of the world. 

Old kings and broken. 

Soon to die. 
Once you had little, 

As little as I. 

Smoke of the city, 
Blow in my eyes — 

[31S] 




 

.Blind me a little, 
Make me wise. 

Dust of the city. 

Blow and gust — 
Make me, like all men, 

Color of dust. 

I stand on Monadnock, 

And seem to see 
Brown and purple kingdoms 

Offered to me. 

Morris Bishop 



ROADS 

You who have made the ancient road of turf, 

That my feet might pass over it 

Into the level evening — 

Make now the ancient road of tears 

That my song may pass over it; 

Make the ancient road of song 

That my ghost may pass over it. 

Coming with the new earth. 

Sarah Unna 



[316I 



 



HOLIDAY CROWD 

They do not know they wear their wounds so plain, 

These covered bodies swathed in cloth and fur. 

They do not dream they hold their naked pain 

Before this show of life — the checkered stir 

Here in the wintry sunlight on the street. 

And yet, like martyrs on an old church wall, 

They point their wounds — their bleeding hands and feet, 

The aching scars, and lips that drank the gall. 

For life has hurt them, though they will not cry 

"Enough"; shaped flesh to hunger quick or dead. 

Withered them, harried, twisted bones awry. 

And bleached them white beneath their flying red. 

Strange skeletons in merry dominoes. 

They do not dream how plain the outline shows. 

WINGED VICTORY 

Your flimsy dress. 

Out of a bargain basement, 

Reacts to the wind 

As the living draperies 

Of the Victory of Samothrace. 

Your body also is proudly revealed. 

Cleaving the air as hers. 

And, verily, you would do as well 

Wthout a head. „ . ft 

Hortense Flexner 

MONOLOGUE FROM A MATTRESS 

Heinrich Heine^ aeiat^dy loquitur: 

Can that be you, La Mouche? Wait till I lift 

This palsied eyelid and make sure. . . . Ah, true. 

Come in, dear fly, and pardon my delay 

In thus existing; I can promise you 

Next time you come you'll find no dying poet! 

Without sufiicient spleen to see me through. 

The joke becomes too tedious a jest. 

I am afraid my mind is dull today; 

I have that — something — heavier on my chest, 

And then, you see, Fve been exchanging thoughts 

With Doctor Franz. He talked of Kant and Hegel 

As though he'd nursed them both through whooping-cough ; 

And, as he left, he let his finger shake 

Too playfully, as though to say, "Now off 

With that long face — you've years and years to live." 

I think he thinks so. But, for Heaven's sake. 

Don't credit it — and never tell Mathilde. 

Poor dear, she has enough to bear already . . . 

This was a month! During my lonely weeks 

One person actually climbed the stairs 

To seek a cripple. It was Berlioz — 

But Berlioz always was original. 

Come here, my lotus-flower. It is best 

I drop the mask today; the half-cracked shield 



 



Louis Untermeyer 



Of mockery calls for younger hands to wield. 
Laugh — or I'll hug it closer to my breast! 
So ... I can be as mawkish as I choose 
And give my thoughts an airing, let them loose 
For one last rambling stroll before — ^Now look! 
Why tears? — you never heard me say "the end". 
Before . . . before I dsip them in a book 
And so get rid of them once and for all. 
This is their holiday — we'll let them run — 
Some have escaped already. There goes one . . 
What, I have often mused, did Goethe mean? 
So many years ago, at Weimar, Goethe said, 
"Heine has all the poet's gifts but love." 
Good God! — but that is all I ever had. 
More than enough! — so much of love to give 
That no one gave me any in return. 
And so I flashed and snapped in my own fires 
Until I stood, with nothing left to burn, 
A twisted trunk, in chilly isolation. 
Ein Fichtenbaum steht einsam — you recall ? 
I was that northern tree and, in the South, 
Amalia. ... So I turned to scornful cries, 
Hot iron songs to save the rest of me: 
Plunging the brand in my own misery. 
Crouching behind my pointed wall of words — 
Ramparts I built of moons and loreleys. 
Enchanted roses, sphinxes, love-sick birds. 
Giants^ dead lads who left their graves to dance, 

Fairies and phoenixes and friendly gods 

A curious frieze> half renaissance, half Greek, 
Behind which, in revulsion from romance, 
I lay and laughed — and wept — till I was weak. 
Words were my shelter, words my one escape, 
Words were my weapons against everything. 
Was I not once the son of Revolution? — 
Give me the lyre, I said, and let me sing 
My song of battle: words like flaming stars 
Shot down with power to burn the palaces; 
Words like bright javelins to fly with fierce 
Hate of the oily philistines, and glide 
Through all the seven heavens till they pierce 
The pious hypocrites who dare to creep 
Into the Holy Places. "Then," I cried, 
"I am a fire to rend and roar and leap; 
I am all joy and song, all sword and flame!" 
H'm — you observe me passionate. I aim 
To curb these wild emotions lest they soar 
Or drive against my will. (So I have said 
These many years — and still they are not tame.) 
Scraps of a song keep rumbling in my head . . . 
Listen — you never heard me sing before. 

When a false world betrays your trust 
And stamps upon your fire ^ 

When what seemed blood is only rusty 
Take up the lyre! 


Louis Untermeyer 



How quicUy the heroic mood 
Responds to its own ringing; 

The scornful hearty the angry blood 
Leap upwardy singing! 

Ah, that was how it used to be. But now, 

Du sch^ner Todesengel^ it is odd 

How more than calm I am. Franz said he knew 

It was religion, and it is, perhaps; 

Religion — or morphine — or poultices — God knows. 

I sometimes have a sentimental lapse 

And long for sapors and a physical God. 

When health is all used up, when money goes. 

When courage cracks and leaves a shattered will, 

Christianity begins. For a sick Jew 

It is a very good religion. . . . Still 

I fear that I shall die as I have lived, 

A long-nosed heathen playing with his scars; 

A pagan killed by Weltschmerz. ... I remember. 

Once when I stood with Hegel at a window, 

I, being full of bubbling youth and co£Fee, 

Spoke in symbolic tropes about the stars. 

Something I said about " those high 

Abodes of the blest'' provoked his temper. 

"Abodes? the stars?" — he froze me with a sneer; 

"A light eruption on the firmament." 

"But," cried romantic I, "is there no sphere 

Where virtue is rewarded when we die?" 

[321I 




 

And Hegel mocked: "A very pleasant whim — 

So you demand a bonus since you spent 

One lifetime and refrained from poisoning 

Your testy grandmother!" . . . How much of him 

Remains in me — even when I am caught 

In dreams of death and immortality! 

To be eternal — what a brilliant thought! 

It must have been conceived and coddled first 

By some old shopkeeper in Nuremberg, 

His slippers warm, his children amply nursed. 

Who, with his lighted meerschaum in his hand, 

His nightcap on his head, one summer night 

Sat drowsing at his door; and mused: ^^How grand 

If all of this could last beyond a doubt-r- 

This placid moon, this plump gemuthlichkeit; 

Pipe, breath and summer never going out — 

To vegetate through all eternity. ..." 

But no such everlastingness for me! — 

God, if he can, keep me from such a blight. 

Deathy it is but the long cool nighty 
And lifers a sad and sultry day. 
It darkens; I prow sleepy; 

I am weary of the light. 

Over my bed a strange tree gleamSy 
And there a nightingale is loud 


Louis Untermeyer 



She sings of lovCy love only 
I hear i/, even in dreams. 



My Mouche, the other day as I lay here> 

Slightly propped up upon this mattress-grave 

In which I've been interred these few eight years, 

I saw a dog, a little pampered slave. 

Running about and barking. I would have given 

Heaven could I have been that dog; to thrive 

Like him, so senseless — and so much alive! 

And once I called myself a blithe Hellene, 

Who am too much in love with life to live. 

The shrug is pure Hebraic ... for what I've been, 

A lenient Lord will tax me — and forgive. 

Dieu me pardonnera — c*est son metier. 

But this is jesting. There are other scandals 

You haven't heard. . . • Can it be dusk so soon? — 

Or is this deeper darkness . . . ? Is that you. 

Mother? — how did you come? And are those candles 

There on that tree whose golden arms are filled? — 

Or are they birds whose white notes glimmer through 

The seven branches now that all is stilled? 

What — Friday night again and all my songs 

Forgotten? Wait ... I still can sing —

COMMENT 

NEWSPAPER VERSE 

A RECENT editorial in the Washington Herald 
begins with the following paragraph: 

Literary editors of newspapers know that some of the best vene 
brought out in America first sees the light of day in the columns of the 
press. Morocco binding and hand-drawn initials don't insure ex- 
cellence^ nor have the higher-class magazines any monopoly on truly 
good poetry. 

And corroborative evidence is offered from the Atlanta 
Constitution f which says: 

Some of the best poetry written in this country today appears first 
in the columns of the daily or weeidy press. The literary magazines 
have never had a monopoly of it — and they never will. 

In discussing newspaper verse it is hardly fair to 
include the "weekly press"; for our only purely literary 
reviews, or reviews largely devoted to current literature — 
such papers as The Literary Review of the New York 
Evening Posty The Nation, The New Republic y The Freemany 
the New York Times Magazine — are weeklies, and as a 
rule they are much more progressively edited, so far as 
modern poetry is concerned, than most of the monthlies. 
Reedy" s Mirror, for example, under the editorship of a 
remarkable man, was a much more *' literary magazine" 
in its day than The Century y Harper* Sy Scriiner*Sy or any 
other alleged "higher-class magazine"; and it had 
more "discoveries" to its credit, in both verse and prose, 


Newspaper Verse 

than all these New York respectables combined. In fact, 
the weeklies have been more hospitable to modern poets, 
to "the new movement," than any of the monthlies 
except The Dialy The Masses with its successor The 
Liberator J and the magazines which, like Poetry, are the 
special organs of the art. 

Therefore we shall confine our part of the present 
discussion to newspaper verse, to those "colyumists" and 
other poets — and poetasters — who have got their start, 
and won their fame, through broad-cast publication in 
the daily papers. On this basis let us inquire whether 
"some of the best verse" is thus introduced. 

The best light verse — yes, unquestionably. The wit- 
tily rhyming commentator on life and letters, appearing 
from day to day in Sharps and Flats y A Line o* Type or 
Twoy The Conning Tower, The Periscope, and other 
columns less familiar to this editor, has added to our 
literature masterpieces in this kind. Eugene Field 
began it with poems like The Bibliomaniac* s Prayer and 
The Truth about Horace, each of which started a fashion. 
Bert Leston . Taylor continued it with such incisive 
satires as In the Gallery and The Kaiser's Farewell to 
Prince Henry. And more recent Chicago philosophers 
are living up to the tradition. Who could show a nimbler 
wit or a keener critical insight than Keith Preston in 
many poems now reprinted from The Periscope in his 
new book, Splinters? — for example, this one, entitled 
Effervescence and Evanescence: 

We've found this Scott Fitzgerald chap 

A chipper, charming child; 

He's uught us how the flappers flap. 

And why the whipper-snappers snap. 

What makes the women wild. 

But now he should make haste to trap 

The ducats in his dipper — 

The birds that put him on the map 

Will shortly all be^ to rap 

And flop to something flipper. 

And if Mr. Preston wields a rapier, listen to the blows 
of Guy Lee's bludgeon — in honor of that noble animal, 
the frog, who has to keep his mouth shut in order to 
breathe. We quote from a Chicago Tribune of recent 
date: 

When I hear the politician spouting hot lur by the ton, 
When I note the silly twaddle of the genus Native Son, 
When I'm sentenced to a banquet where a war of words ensues, 
When a socialist gets near me and begins to shout his views. 
When a bore essays a story that has neither point nor end. 
When a highbrow author's ego by his voice starts to extend. 
When a woman with a gnevance (or without one) launches out 
On a marathon of language o'er the conversation route, 
I ponder on this habit of mankind to squeak and squawk 
In a never..ending serial of talk and talk and talk; 
And I figger, as we flounder in the vocalistic bog. 
It's a pity human beings are not fashioned like the frog! 

Such humor as these things from our newspaper poets 
is straight American stuff, expressive of our kind of smiling 
common-sense, our special good-natured chuckle, over the 
piffle and burble, the mawkishness and pretense which 
encumber our every-day life. Such wit from the colyum-

Newspaper Verse 

ists is a shaft of sunlight on the breakfast-table-^-it clears 
the air and gleams on the sharpened edge of the mind. 

But what about the more serious verse of the newspaper 
poets? To be sure, Eugene Field's finest poems — such as 
Little Boy Blue and fVynkeity Blynken and Nod — first saw 
the light in his Sharps and Flats; Frank Stanton achieved 
one now and then in Atlanta; and a few slyly delicate 
poems by Bert Taylor adorned the Line. But the 
successors of these men have been less inclined to favor 
the unsmiling muse, or she to favor them; and the song- 
sters they admit to their columns are usually about as 
adventurously lyric as a chirping sparrow. If ''some of 
the best verse first sees the light of day" in these columns 
of cheer, the present writer has missed it. Yet here may 
be found, as a rule, the best of the newspaper verse — at 
least these column sparrows are honest, and their saltily 
humorous environment keeps them from rot and reek. 

But what shall be said of certain other kinds of seriously 
intended newspaper verse — of the placid rhyming 
journalese of Walt Mason or the syndicated moralizings 
of Edgar Guest? The former may be harmless; his end- 
less reeling of facile observations has sometimes a faint 
trace of savor — the tireless crank is turned by a mild old 
busybody at least humanely observant. But the stickily 
sugary Mr. Guest is not only a blight but a menace. 
His molasses factory proves profitable in more ways than 
one; so, like other wide-awake business-men, he spreads 
its products over the land. Syndicated in hundreds of 

newspapers, crowded with platform engagements, this 
favorite of fortune, journeying to Denver, is met at the 
station by the whole Colorado legislature, adjourned in 
his honor and celebrating his greatness with a brass t^and. 
And the school-children of many cities are stimulated by 
his example toward the high rewards, financial and glory- 
coronal, of poesy. 

Let us examine Mr. Guest's style — here is a recent 
and typical example, entitled For the New Year: 

This I would like to be — braver and bolder, 

Just a bit wiser because I am older, 

Just a bit kinder to those I may meet, 

Just a bit manlier taking defeat. 

This for the New Year my wish and my plea: 

Lord, make a regular man out of me. 

This I would like to be— just a bit finer, 
More of a smiler and less of a whiner; 
Just a bit quicker to stretch out my hand 
Helping another who's struggling to stand. 
This is my prayer for the New Year to be: 
Lord, make a regular man out of me. 

This I would like to be— just a bit fairer, 
Just a bit better and just a bit squarer, 
Not quite so ready to censure and blame. 
Quicker to help every man in the game. 
Not quite so eager men's failings to see — 
Lord, make a regular man out of me. 

This I would like to be— just a bit truer. 
Less of the wisher and more of the doer; 
Broader and bigger, more willing to give, 
Living and helping my neighbor to live. 
This for the New Year my prayer and my plea: 
Lord, make a regular man out of me. 


Newspaper Verse 

What do those Colorado legislators think they find in 
such sermonizing twaddle as this? Poetry? — if such a 
fond allusion is possible, how do they define poetry? In 
what department of their minds do they receive its proud 
appeal? Wisdom? — if they are honoring a sage, what 
high truth is he telling them? To what clear heights is he 
leading their souls? Do they discover beauty in this 
cheap rattle of foot-rule rhymes, emotion in this sickish 
slobber of easy virtue? Is it this rhymester or them- 
selves they are stultifying when they offer him public 
homage, and thereby inform the rising generation that he 
is their ideal of a great man of letters? 

Mr. Guest is not the only one of his kind — alas! — but 
he is conspicuous and typical. These syndicated rhymers, 
like the movie-producers, are learning that "it pays to 
be good," that one "gets by by giving the people the 
emotions of virtue, simplicity and goodness, with this 
program paying at the box-office." And it pays very well. 

B. L. T. hit off the situation a decade or more ago, 
saying: 

Lives of poets oft remind us 

Not to wait too long for time, 
But, departing, leave behind us 
Obvious facts embalmed in rhyme. 

Poems that we have to ponder 

Turn us prematurely gray; 
We are infinitely fonder 

Of the simple heartfelt lay. 

Whitman's Leaves of Grass is odious. 
Browning's Ring and Book a bore. 



Bleat, ye bards, in lines melodious. 
Bleat that two and two is four! 

Today he might have added: 

Bleat, ye bards, of home and mother, 

Pray to be a regular man. 
Treacle mixed with tears is golden — 

Pile the shekels while you can. 

Let the newspaper poets be true to the muse of laughter. 
We need their salt in our daily food> lest the maudlin 
adulterations of pseudo-literary profiteers poison our 
in'ards! H. M.

MISS Lowell's legends 

Legendsy by Amy Lowell. Houghton Mifflin Co. 

Too many legends are getting lost and forgotten. To 
tell any of them over again and save them from the dust 
and ashes of the dead is a good thing; but even better to 
tell them so people will listen. To most of Miss Amy 
Lowell's Legends it is not easy to listen intently — they 
are too crowded with adjectives, with ornament, with 
imagery; they are obese with adornment. So they do not 
cut into you the way even the bare outline of a story may 
do in some textbook of mythology, or the way voices of a 
legendary day sometimes still reach you through old men 
and old women bridging two epochs. 


Miss LowclTs Legends 

In Legends Miss Lowell has sought alliance with Aztec, 
Cantonese, Indian, and English; but has not, it seems, 
become one with any of them. Their grief is not her 
grief, their passion not her passion. At their feasts and 
funerals she revels more like a tourist in the surprises of 
intricate ancient rites. She lays no claim, it is true, to 
accuracy; she has ''changed, added, subtracted, jumbled 
several stories together," she says, "at will to suit her 
particular vision." But she has not made them over with 
a vision acute enough to equal the origin of primitive lore. 
She has not made them with an economy of means that 
comes of violence. 

As a vendor of foreign goods she resorts to selling-talk, 
with sometimes the taint of a conflicting code of morals 
or manners upon it. So in the Aztec story of a fox 
assaulting the moon, the print of a fox's paws on the disc 
of the moon is labeled as "obscene." She labels these 
characters, the fox and the moon, instead of making them 
sheerly exist. 

It is a pity, the way this book has of calling things by 
so many names that they cease to be named at all. One 
is aware of passing by almost with indifference succinct, 
polished song and picture which in more spare surround- 
ings might make an instant appeal, a quick thrust. This 
passage for one: 

A stream flowed in a sunwise turn across the prairie, and the name of 
the stream was Burnt Water, because it tasted dark like smoke. 
The prairie ran out tongues of raw colors — blue of camass, red of 
geranium, yellow of parsley — ^at the young green grass. The prairie 

flung up its larks on a string of sunshine, it lay like a catching-sheet 
beneath the black breasts balancing down on a wind, calling, "See 
it! See it!" in little round voices. 

If you consider each legend in the book as a unit of art, 

it is easy to remember only the two last poems — Before 

the Storm and Four Sides to a House. One of these is New 

England legend; the other, not labeled, seems as real and 

as native to Miss Lowell. The ghosts of a man and child 

driving a high yellow chaise and a white horse before 

wind and rain, unwind, as the wheels whirl, a keen 

impetuous movie of New England. Four Sides to a House 

is a beautiful ballad — the crying of an old man, murdered, 

buried in a well. Words, rhymes, stanzas fall into place; 

the sound is true; the design complete and haunting. 

Here is one bead of the ballad string quoted for the 

pleasure of quoting: 

Around the house, and around the house. 

With a wind that is North, and a wind that is South, 

Peter, Peter. 
Mud and ooze and a dead man's wrist 
Wrenching the shutters apart, like mist 
The mud and the ooze and the dead man twist. 

They arc praying, Peter. 

This is a poem with intangible quality. Many of the 
others disobey the laws of measure andxontrast, which are 
bound up with mysteries, and which rule that shadows 
will be sure to count against a blaze of light or a blaze of 
incident, that brilliants come to life across a dark sky, 
that a dance is figured also by its pauses, and objects by 
the space they keep around them. Dorothy Dudley 


Spear-shajt and Cyclamen-flower 

SPEAR-SHAFT AND CYCLAMEN-FLOWER 

Hymeny by H. D. Henry Holt & Co. 

It is difficult to write an appreciation or criticism 
of modern literature because words have altered slowly 
during the past century and have lost their rightful 
meaning. Beauty, wisdom, life — these terms have come 
to represent an indefinite standard of pedantry or the 
washed-out sentiment of some school-room text. Civiliza- 
tion has rendered the states that these words should 
express almost impossible of achievement. So there is 
discontent, a brooding rebellion — no new forceful words 
and the old ones blurred until the same sentence may 
evoke for different people entirely separate worlds. 

Thus it has been said of H. D.'s earlier poetry that it 
was perfectly wrought but cold and passionless, and that 
it was concerned rather with the loveliness of a perished 
age than with the modern world or everyday emotions. 
But is it not simply the association of Greek with scholas- 
ticism, in the minds of these critics, that has led them 
astray in their consideration of the poet's work? 

Perfectly wrought the poems are: the rhythms swoop 
in and out of the head as birds perch and flutter in and 
out of apple-branches. Lines haunt the ears as the 
sound of rain in the South. The use of some simple 
but unexpected syllable brings all the fragrance into a 
mood that the Ionian roses suddenly awaken, after some 
swift storm. But they are not cold, they are not passion- 
less; and apart from the color of some Attic names how 

are these songs anything but the expression of the emo- 
tions and desires of an extremely present age? 

To people born in England H. D/s work is peculiarly 
American — ^American with a southern flavor and a sin- 
gularly native strength. Call Simaetha any American 
name and nothing is lost but the impersonality of the 
far-off, silver-grey Greek syllables. Circe is any woman 
of intellect who, with the very sincerity of her vision, 
turns lesser minds "each to his own self.'' The children 
in Hymen are strange in their beauty only because the 
restrictions of school have not seized them too early 
nor crushed them into patterns. 

It is true that H. D. is concerned with life, which 
changes little from epoch to epoch, rather than with 
the exterior impressions of telephones or steel rails. She 
is very sensitive to the visible world, but it is not particu- 
larly Greek; her country is any stretch of sea-coast in 
Europe or America where there are sand and low pools 
and surge of heavy rocks. Compare the Phaedra and 
the Hippolytus series, which were actually written in 
Greece, with Cuckoo Songy Thetis^ or Evadne. Apart from 
an added intensity of color — the "lizard-blue" water, 
the "red sands" of Crete — they are as independent as 
the poems written further north of any definite landscape. 

Could anything be more modern of mood than these 
€ew lines from At Baia? 

I should have thought 

In a dream you would have brought 


spear-shaft and Cyclamen-flower 

Some lovely, perilous thing — 

Orchids piled in a great sheath, 

As who would say (in a dream), 

I send you this 

Who left the blue vems 

Of your throat unkissed. 

The song is too long to quote in full> but it expresses per- 
haps more perfectly than any other recent poem, the dis- 
appointment and yet the sympathy which come when 
some personality one has admired fails to fulfil both its 
promise and its. task. 

It is not easy to be true to any faith in a war-torn 
world. Perhaps the most difficult test of all is to keep 
faith in beauty. But there is no sentiment or weakness 
in the lines which follow — they are stark as a war-chant 
or as waves against a prow: 

But beauty is set apart; 

Beauty is cast by the sea, ^ 

A barren rock; 

Beauty is set about 

With wrecks of ships 

Upon our coasts; death keeps 

The shallows — death waits 

Clutching toward us 

From the deeps. 

Beauty is set apart; 
The winds that slash its beach 
Swirl the coarse sand 
Upward toward the rocks. 

Beauty is set apart 
From the islands 
And from Greece. 

Life is a fact to the poet, not a dream. But she has 
a trick of hiding a difficult thought under a beautiful 
phrase until the eyes read the song carelessly, and only 
with the ripening of personal experience is the truth 
uncovered behind the vivid words. A psychological 
state that a scientist might take a volume to describe 
is crystallized into a couple of pages. And she can turn 
and write songs such as the one which follows, simple 
as any Elizabethan lyric and without the sixteenth- 
century mannerisms. 

From citron-bower be her bed, 
Cut from branch of tree a flower 
Fashioned for her maidenhead. 

From Lydian apples, sweet of husk, 
Cut the width of board and lathe. 
Carve the feet from myrtle-wood. 

Let the palings of her bed 

Be quince and box-wood overlaid 

With the scented bark of yew. 

That all the wood in blossoming. 
May calm her heart and cool her blood 
For losing of her maidenhood. 

Her psychology is never once at fault. Thetis, proud, 
beautiful and alone; Simaetha, wrecked by war; Phaedra, 
smashed by alien forces — it is only their names (perhaps 
their personal beauty) that differentiate them from the 
individuals who struggle and suffer in this present world. 
They are not easily found, but personality is rare in an 
age of standardized opinions and patented emotions. 


spear-shaft and Cyclamen-flower 

And perhaps the essential characteristic of these poems 
is their originality— they are cyclamen flowers caught 
on the spear-point of an analytical intellect. 

Not cold, not passionless, but with emotion and thought 
perfectly balanced. Hymen can make even the "dis- 
enchanted days" of which the poet writes, bright with 
beauty. W, Bryher 

"a distinguished young man" 

The Living Friezey by Mark Turbyfill. Monroe Wheeler, 

Evanston, 111. 

Mark Turbyfill is a young man, but has already been 
spoken of in print and out, and it is a pleasure to con- 
sider his poems as a whole in Mr. Wheeler's excellently 
made book. One has already heard so much unfortunate 
talk of Mr. TurbyfiU's estheticism, that one is lucky 
to have a slight acquaintance with his work as it has 
appeared in the magazines before approaching this book 
by way of the reviewers. When a reviewer in our gen- 
eration speaks of a poet as an "esthete" he is generally 
being sentimental about that poet's sentimentality; and 
this is a lamentable condition for a good word to reach. 
As for reviewers, they are largely static. 

For Mr. Turbyfill can indeed be sentimental, and 
that a good part of the time, his sentimentality being 
greatly patterned after the writings of that other esthete 
of late consideration, Richard Aldington. But it is not 

for this reason that he is one of the dozen or so living 
Americans who have done anything worth remembering. 
At his best, Mr. Turbyfill is the master of a certain 
fleeting precision that, like the finest of needles, strikes 
deep into one's being and is gone before it can be observed. 

I am the surprised young man, light walker on night lawns, 

he writes; and in a recognition and fuller exploitation of 
this fact willlie his greatness if he ever achieves it. This 
one sentence, unfortunately, is embedded in a long dis- 
cussion of a love-affair which has few merits; and very 
often Mr. Turbyfill spoils an excellent passage by not 
knowing where to cut. Had this passage stood alone, 
it had been one of his finest poems. 

Perhaps his weakness is a conscience which drives 
him to do complete justice to his friends, loves and admi- 
rations, wherever they have acted as the original impetus 
of a poem. He forgets that a poem is a state of perfec- 
tion at which a poet arrives by whatever means; and that 
the poem has no responsibility of any sort to ladies or 
lambrequins. It is a thing that begins somewhere and 
ends in itself. 

In such poems as Shapes- and Fertile Gesture Mr. 
Turbyfill has remembered, or not needed to remember, 
this fundamental truth. I quote Shapes intact, as an 
example of the poet at his finest: 

Let us deliberately sit into design 
With these elephant ears 


"/f Distinguished Young Man'* 

Stretched from the pot 

Into green wax consciousness. 

Let us exert 
Our unused selves 
Into other static 
Sharpnesses. ' 

In what fleet gestures 
Have you found eternity? 

His amber-painted torso 
A Persian dancer 
Has conceived into a leaf-line, 
The head inclined. 

Other poems that one remembers are She Walks to 
Pisa^ Fragment of Vision^ Carved Moody Burden of Blue 
and Goldy The Moments Halt a Little While before the 
Day^ and End of Summer. There are lines and passages 
scattered through other poems, the finest of these being 
the sentence already quoted, and the third stanza of 
The Intangible Symphony. 

To estimate the magnitude of such a poet as Mr. 
Turbyfill is a difficult if not impossible task. This despite 
the fact that at least one word of magnitude has been 
spoken of him in this review. But one can accurately 
say that his five or six finest poems are perfectly executed, 
and endrely achieve that which they apparently set out 
to achieve. And perhaps this is the fullest praise that 
one can give to any poet. Yvor Winters

A PRIZE-WINNER 

Heavens and Earthy by Stephen Vincent Ben6t. Henry 

Holt & Co. 

(This book shared with Carl Sandburg's Smoke and 
Steel the Poetry Society's recent award of five hundred 
dollars to the best American verse published in 1920.) 

Not long ago I heard Robert Frost remark laughingly 
before an audience that one could practically place a 
poet as major or minor according to the number of times 
he used the word beauty. By that gauge Heavens and 
Earth is indeed a large order. 

The first section of the book is called Two Visions of 
Helen; it begins: 

Slowly blanch-handed Dawn, eyes half awake. 
Upraised magnificent the silver urn. 

The word morning appears in italics in the margin to 
print on the mind a clear and single image. One need 
not demand of Stephen Ben6t that he be either Carl 
Sandburg or J. V. A. Weaver — many of the younger 
poets are turning away with tired eyes from the verities 
of modern life. But Victoria is dead — that, at least, 
has been definitely settled; it is too late to contest it 
and futile to look back. 

The poet continues: 

Beautiful monstrous dreams they seemed as they ran, 
Trees come alive at the nod of a god grown mute! 
Their eyes looked up to the sun like a valiant man; 
Their bows clashed shrill on the loins and limbs of the brute! 


A Prize-winner 

The second line is quite plainly inserted to meet the 

exigencies of rhyme; the rest plainly a compromise with 

rhyme. An ultimate word exists that will do duty for 

both sense and sound. Is not art the pursuit of that 

word? 

Laughing, rejoicing, white as a naked birch, 
Slim as a spear in a torrent of moving towers, 
Itys, the prince, ran gay in the storm of their search 
Silverly shod on feet that outstripped the Hours 1 

Heavens and Earth so aptly illustrates the vices of its 
school that the expos4 may as well be thorough now it 
is begun. Was the towers line added only to rhyme with 
HourSy since white as a naked birch conveys not only 
color but form ? For me slim as a spear is, besides being 
poor economy, confusing; it leaves me with the blurred 
image of one who has stared for a long time at the same 
spot. Nature is admittedly prolix; it is left for that royal 
combination of gift and reason which determine the poet 
to model and trim beyond the possibility of confusion. 
Let the artist's scope be the universe, but let the artist 
hold the rein. It is admonitory to speculate on what 
the masters must have held in reserve in prunings alone, for 
they were all great economists. And who does not know 
that one thought leads to another? 

Stephen Ben6t has imagination; otherwise — one fails 

to detect behind his art that significant struggle for the 

final syllable, the final image. Rather a quick acceptance 

of what the tempter, tradition, whispers into the ear. 


an interesting line. He dreamed as a dog dreams ^ uneasily; 
and another. And how she smoothed her hair back with one 
handy the universal gesture of woman. But The Visions 
of Helen are not successful. What is the reason, if any, 
for the long symphonic arrangement? One has a right 
to expect that the form a poet uses justify itself. Many 
of Mr. Ben6t's changes of movement differ only in length 
of line; otherwise, the same overwrought design, the same 
lameness. Although both the Helen stories have a 
reasonable amount of inherent interest, one is left with 
the feeling that they might have been done carefully, 
in a page apiece, with more point. 

Two at the Crossroads dallies with the delicious idea 
of the meeting of one Palomides and a stranger; -Palo- 
mides riding furiously, his brain a black pin- wheel. He 
answers the stranger's inquiry after the sea-road with a 
maudlin account of his love for Iseult, and rides madly on. 
Then, the amusing d£nouement: 

Palomides was far. 
And, settling well his harp apon his back, 
With something of amusement in his mouth, 
Tristram rode southward to the Breton ships. 

But Mr. Ben£t is still without identity. In this in- 
stance it is a slightly chastened Tennyson. Many 
moderns write for the eye alone. H. D., William Carlos 
Williams, subordinate the oral to the visual, making 
a form akin in impression to the mural or bas-relief. 
The concern of the present poet is to grind out grand- 


A Prize-winner 

iloquent Victorian harmonies. Fortunately it has been 

proved, by Carl Sandburg among others, that on^ may 

write primarily for the ear and still retain the identity 

both of the individual and of the age. 

Take Three Days* Ride, the old theme of elopement and 

tragic outcome, a story which depends for very existence 

upon the unique style of the artist and its relevancy to 

period and locality. Certainly no man who takes pride 

in his modernity would have begun thus: 

We had fled full fast from her father's keep, 
And the time had come that we must sleep. 

For the rest, it is to be remembered that, as we live in 
the age of the superlative, hyperbole no longer has force 
behind it. To exaggerate in the hope of heightening 
the effect of drama is to frustrate oneself in advance. 
Simple statement of fact is more impressive. 

The Kingdom of the Mady the last section, a series of 
sonnets in a less serious humor, is more felicitous. The 
poet seems not quite so young and chaotic. He detaches 
himself and begins to speak in order with urbanity. 

" Books should be tried by a judge and a jury as though 
they were crimes, and counsel should be heard on both 
sides,'' says Samuel Butler in his Note Books. On my 
side, I am left with the unsatisfactory sense that Stephen 
Ben£t's verses are melodramatic accidents of rhythm 
and rhyme. I look in vain for volition, for image and 
thought too sacred to have been lightly changed. 


A LUTE OF ONE STRING 

The Lijted Cupy by Jessie B. Rittenhouse. Houghton 
Mifflin Co. 

This small book of forty or more very brief poems is a 
soft-voiced little lute of one string. So restricted a lyric 
range seems scarcely possible from a woman who has 
traveled about this varied world; and the emotional ex- 
perience it records is too narrow to be easily accepted as 
the whole truth. It is rather an unconscious yielding to 
a convention — the presentation of a wistful and sensitive 
feminine type as men and women of richer experience 
expect to find it. We have it caught to perfection in a 
number of these poems, for example The Door: 
There was a door stood long ajar 

That one had left for me. 
While I went trying other doors 

To which I had no key. 
And when at last I turned to seek 

The refuge and the light, 
A gust of wind had shut the door 
And left me in the night. 

Perhaps the following poem comes nearer escaping the 
convention than any other in this book — has a brighter 
bloom. Its first line is its title: 

We who give our hearts in spring, 

Putting all the old life by. 
We shall start with everything 

Keen and glad beneath the sky. 
We shall know the urge of grass 
Parting each detaining clod, 


A Lute of One String 



Know the one sweet day they pass — 
Flowers, the spirit of the sod. 

We are caught into the flame 
Where the golden fire runs — 

All its ardor is the same. 
In the fiesh and in the suns. 



A POET IN EMBRYO 



H.M. 



Archways of Life^ by Mercedes de Acosta. Moffat, Yard 

& Co. 

This book shows a distinct advance over Moods in 
poetic technique, although most of the poems still leave 
much to be desired. The author has certain gifts of the 
poet — quick feeling, a degree of imaginative insight, and 
eagerness to pour out her soul, to express the beauty 
and strangeness of life, to give herself away. She says 
what she has to say with a forthright simplicity and di- 
rectness; and in such poems as Platitudes and Your Face 
she says a fine thing, with refreshment in it. 

But she is just beginning to learn her trade. She 
shows a promising capacity to learn it in three or four 
poems — Unreality y Poor Fools ^ To Vouletti — in which 
there is a suggestion of poetic rhythm. Sometimes she 
uses rhyme — usually the irregular, half-veiled rhymes now 
so much in vogue; but not yet with quite the air of an 
adept. Occasionally she should give another thought to 
such details as grammar: one can stand will for j^//— all 
of us do that — but not "the maddest of we three." 

However, one may forgive much to a book which re- 
veals a fresh and ardent personality. And one may hope 
that after a few more experimental sheaves the art will 
respond to the impulse. H. M. 

RHETORIC UNASHAMED 

Ireland Unfreed: Poems of ig2i^ by Sir \^^iam Watson. 

John Lane G>. 

Rhetoric here marches unashamed across the cluttered 
stage of the world's affairs — ^rhetoric, flaunting exaggerated 
gestures under its shabby outworn toga, stubbing the 
toe of its stiflF buskin against 

rapine masked as order, his vast maw 
With Vengeance still andoyed. 

Is it possible that this kind of thing is still masking as 
poetry? — here begins a sonnet To the Prime Minister yet 
again: 

Like your renown-dad namesake, who did slay. 
Far across Hme and its vast chamds drear, 
If only with a legendary spear, 
A fabled dragon, you in your midday 
. Did unto ravening things give battle, and they 
Fdt your light lance through all their scales! 

Now, SO we are informed, that spear is "pointed at the 
captive maiden's breast" — and so on to the end, reading 
a bit out-of-date today« May the kind fates deliver 
Ireland from her friends! H. M. 


CORRESPONDENCE 



THE CODE OF MINORITY 



Everybody is sentimental, even Mr. Yvor Winters. 
Emily Dickinson, he says, is dowdy; Emerson, senti- 
mental; Whitman, an eventual dull vacuum; Sandburg, 
plasmodial delirium. I am not used to defending old 
gods, or new ones; but I can show, I think, that these 
adjectives indicate a sentimentalism that is not only Mr. 
Winters' but the characteristic of the larger group of 
modern noticeable poets. It is not expansive Germanic 
sentimentality, to be sure; it is protective sentimentality, 
hard and slender. But it is no less sentimental, for it is 
based on a conceit, on a vain study of approach and 
manner. Its mode is not determined by content. 

Whether New England hardness, which Mr. Winters 
reviews in A Cool Master in the February Poetry, is 
really the hardness that Mr. Winters is thinking about is 
doubtful. Whatever its hardness, the New England 
idea is primarily earnest — earnest frankly in the content 
of poetry — as Mr. Winters, to judge from his adjectives, 
can never be. When he can say cleverly, "This man has 
the culture to know that, to those to whom philosophy is 
comprehensible, it is not a matter of first importance; 
and he knows that these people are not greatly impressed 
by a ballyhoo statement of the principles of social and 
spiritual salvation," it is clear that he is not expounding 
New England hardness, nor anything like it, but the 

assumed hardness of sophisticated Gallic reaction. 
Poets — Emerson, Whitman, Sandburg — in whom the 
idea-content has a burning importance, may well seem 
to him blathering or sentimental, or beside the poetic 
point. In them the serious idea is not only an intel- 
lectual factor but a definitely esthetic component of 
the poem. Nor does Mr. Winters, in the face of the 
overwhelming human response to ideas, give any good 
reason why it should not be. Ideas have beauty. 

Whence this solemn authority that the poet may tell 
only what he sees, not what he thinks? It comes from 
a protective, contractile impulse. Fear of the world 
beyond the near perceptions, or failure to appreciate, 
is its basis. It is "safety first" in poetry. Blunder and 
bathos threaten the poet who risks being bigger than 
his sensations, and these too often do overwhelm him; 
but the naive exposure that he makes in extending him- 
self beyond protective certainties is necessary. He is 
"sentimental" perhaps, a "preacher," a "philosopher," 
a "peddler," because he cannot always fuse his own 
being with that of his subject matter. He opens himself, 
as Emerson, Whitman and Sandburg unquestionably 
do, to the sarcasm of the tight, cool, hard poets who take 
no risks, but he also escapes their inevitable minority. 
As a productive unit, as an initiative, the poet will never 
be thu$ pigeonholed. All that is humane and interesting 
is poetic. All material waits only the poet with capacity 
and power to use it. 


The Code of Minority 

"A pigeon's wing may make as great an image as a 
man's tragedy," says Mr. Winters. But the profound 
truth of the sentence is not the theme that Mr. Winters 
is defending in it. Emerson and Whitman, or for that 
matter the Vedas, reiterate this truth. It is the most 
beautiful of man's comprehensions; and, as the identity 
of all things, is the very being of art and life. But Mr. 
Winters means nothing of this sort by his pronouncement. 
That would be to "sentimentalize," to preach, and to 
enter untastefuUy into the idea-content of poetry. Mr. 
Winters means by his sentence that greatness lies not in 
those things of which the poet has written, "but in the 
perfect balance, the infallible precision, with which he has 
stated their cases." 

I use Mr. Winters for illustration because he reveals, 
rather more articulately than is usually considered good 
taste in his group, the ideational background of probably 
the larger number of modern poets. Theirs is an un- 
generous principle from which there can be no great 
progress. It is an assumption for the protection of 
minority. And because these presumed limitations are 
emotionalized somewhat, I am justified, I think, in calling 
the hard, cool minorists — the modern French, our Ameri- 
can expatriates in England, Mr. Winters, even Wallace 
Stevens — protectively sentimental. It is the cult of the 
craft, not of great art. 

Let me suggest the code. First: Say little, but say it 
beautifully. Second: Be delicate; nicety is first. Third: 

Be fragmentary; it indicates detachment; a frail wisp of 
fact, a plaintive, inarticulate thread of feeling is enough. 
Fourth: Be cool; sympathies are vulgar. Fifth: Be 
c^efiil; the limitations of the poetic milieu are fixed. 
This is the minor code or something like it, the world 
over. It is not classical, for its restraint has neither 
the amplitude nor the objectivity of the greater classic 
school. It is an introspective restraint, the last reserve 
of a decayed and romantic egoism. It is a hang-over, 
I think, from ante-bellum France. The indifferentism 
assumed by these poets is neither spiritual nor spacious; 
it is the cold chrysalis of individualism from which the 
butterfly has flown. 

Devotion, not detachment, is the foundation of art, 
and devotion these modern minors have not. They have 
ignored the artistic value of ideas. They have tatted 
gracefully in silk, but they have hammered no rhythms in 
steel. Ideas — even moral ideas, and character, though 
abused and betrayed in much Victorian poetry, remain 
primary components of great work. They will remain 
so, despite Mr. Winters and his perceptualists, simply 
for the reason that their Platonic as well as their human 
beauty persists. 

At least two major poets are writing today. They 
are Sandburg and Tagore. Different as they are, every 
poem of theirs, in its fusion of great and earnest content 
with personal form, denies Mr. Winters' thesis.

A New Poetry Society 

A NEW POETRY SOCIETY 

It would be difficult to enumerate the various evidences 
of increasing public interest in poetry, of at least a desire 
to give the art closer attention and better appreciation 
than it has had hitherto. The Poetry Lovers of America, 
a society inaugurated last year in Chicago, is one such 
evidence. Under the presidency of Mrs. D. Harry 
Hammer, it has had an auspicious and interesting first 
season, with five or six meetings at which modern poetry 
was read, and discussed from various points of view, the 
history, traditions and technique of the art being con- 
sidered as well as its modern influences and aims. The 
club's correspondence indicates wide interest in the 
subject, and other groups, through the Middle West 
especially, show a desire to be affiliated with it. The 
membership, of two hundred or more men and women, 
includes both professionals and amateurs. F. P. 

NOTES 

The April number of Poetry will be a Southern Number, the con- 
tributors representing the south-eastern section of the country, whose 
activities in poetry have been encouraged and stimulated during the 
past year by the Poetry Society of South Carolina, centering in Charles- 
ton. In addition to the poems, an editorial by Messrs. Du Bose 
Heyward and Hervey Allen will present the artistic point of view of the 
new-old South. These two poets will contribute a group of Carolina 
Chansons — ballads from the romantic history of the region; Miss 
Beatrice Ravenel, also of Charleston, will be represented, Mrs. Craig 
Barrow of Savannah, Mr. Marx G. Sabel and Mrs. Frances D. Pinder 
of Jacksonville, and others. 

Mr. Carl Sandburg, of Chicago, will publish his fourth book of poems 
in May /through Harcourt, Brace & Co. 

Mr. Louis Untermeyer,ofNew York, also needs no introduction. His 
new book of poems, to be called probably Roast Leviathan^ will be pub- 
lished in the late spring or autumn. 

Hortense Flexner (Mrs. Wyncie King) has recently removed from 
Louisville to Philadelphia, her husband having accepted a job as 
cartoonist for the Public Ledger. 

Mr. Morris Bishop, who is now living in Ithaca, N. Y., has appeared 
in Poetry before. Also Miss Sarah Unna, now resident in New York, 
who was a member of Mr. Bynner's poetry class at the University of 
California three years ago. 

Miss Marion Strobel, of Chicago, has been for two years associate 
editor of Poetry. 

Miss Ruth Harwood, a native of Salt Lake City and now resident in 
Oakland, California, appears for the first time in Poetry. Miss Har- 
wood took a poetry prize at the University of Utah in 1920, and the 
Emily Cook poetry prize at the University of California in 1921. 

Alison Buchanan is a pseudonym.

For a verse-writer to be printed in POETRY is about the 

most honorable of recognitions* 

Ford Afadox Huifflir in thg New York 
Eoening Post Literary Review. 

This monthly publication is an exhibition of literary faith 
and bravery that belong to the heroic age. 

The Daily Journal, East St. Louis. 

The varied interest and beauty presented are typical of 
POETRY'S quality. Thanks to a rare coincidence of 
poise and generous imagination, of sense and sensitiveness, 
it ranks easily as the best vehicle of poetry in the English 
language. 

From an oditorial in tho New York Sunday Tribune. 

POETRY has become a significant force 
in the intellectual life of America. That 
astute observer, the late William Marion 
Reedy, wrote: '^Probably Miss Monroe has 
done more for the high art of song than any 
other person in the United States" — a state- 
ment which has been generously supported 
by other commentators of similar prestige.

Three annual prizes will be awarded as usual in November for good work 
of the year now ending. To the donors of these prizes, as well as to the above list 
of guarantors, the editor wishes to express the appreciation of the 8ta£f and the poets: 

To Mr. S. O. Levinson. for the Helen Haire Levinson Prize of two hundred 
dollars, to be awarded for the ninth time: to the anonymous guarantor who will 
present, for the eighth time, a prize of one hundred dollars; and to the Friday Club 
of Chicago, which has donated one hundred dollars for a prize to a young poet. 

We feel that these prizes are a most valuable service to the art. 

The editor records with deep regret the death, on May twenty-ninth, of Mr. 
William T. Abbott. In spite of his arduous more important duties, Mr. Abbott 
has most graciously served as a member of Poetry's Administrative Committee 
ever since the magazine was founded; and the high authority of his name has been, 
to our guarantors and the public, an assurance of financial soundness. This service 
will always be remembered with gratitude by the staff of the magazine. 

The death, on February sixteenth, of Mr. John S. MiUer, the distinguished 
Chicago lawyer, removed from our immediate presence one of the most lo3^ friends 
of the magazine, who had been one of its guarantors from the beginning. The 
editor remembers vividly and gratefully a witty and discriminating speech which 
Mr. Miller made at a Pobtry banquet, showing the depth of his appreciation of 
the "new movement." and of the magazine'tf aims and ideals.

CHARLESTON POEMS 

DUSK 

THEY tell me she is beautiful, my city, 
That she is colorful and quaint; alone 
Among the cities. But I — I who have known 
Her tenderness, her courage, and her pity; 
Have felt her forces mold me, mind and bone, 
Life after life, up from her first beginning — 
How can I think of her in wood and stone! 
To others she has given of her beauty: 
Her gardens, and her dim old faded ways; 
Her laughter, and her happy drifting hours; 
Glad spendthrift April, squandering her flowers; 
The sharp still wonder of her autumn days; 

[I] 




 

Her chimes, that shimmer from St. Michael's steeple 

Across the deep maturity of June 

Like sunlight slanting over open water 

Under a high blue listless afternoon. 

But when the dusk is deep upon the harbor, 

She finds me where her rivers meet and speak, 

And while the constellations gem the silence 

High overhead, her cheek is on my cheek. 

I know her in the thrill behind the dark 

When sleep brims all her silent thoroughfares. 

She is the glamour in the quiet park 

That kindles simple things like grass and trees; 

Wistful and wanton as her sea-born airs, 

Bringer of dim rich age-old memories. 

Out on the gloom-deep water, when the nights 

Are choked with fog, and perilous, and blind. 

She is the faith that tends the calling lights. 

Hers is the stifled voice of harbor bells, 

Muffled and broken by the mist and wind. 

Hers are the eyes through which I look on life 

And find it brave and splendid. And the stir 

Of hidden music shaping all my songs, 

And these my songs, my all, belong to her. 

EDGAR ALLAN POE 

Once in the starlight 
When the tides were low, 


DuBose Heyward 



And the surf fell sobbing 

To the undertow, 
I trod the windless dunes 

Alone with Edgar Poe. 

Dim and far behind us, 

Like a fabled bloom 
On the myrtle thickets, 

In the swaying gloom 
Hung the clustered windows 

Of the barrack-room. 

Faint on the evening, 

Tenuous and far 
As the beauty shaken 

From a vagrant star. 
Throbbed the ache and passion 

Of an old guitar. 

Life closed behind us 
Like a swinging gate, 

Leaving us unfettered 
And emancipate; 

Confidants of Destiny^ 
Intimates of Fate. 

I could only cower 
Silent, while the night. 

Seething with its planets. 
Parted to our sight,

Oh, we heard the many things 

Silence has to say — 
He and I together 

As alone we lay 
Waiting for the slow sweet 

Miracle of day. 

When the bugle's silver 

Spiralled up the dawn 
Dew-clear, night-cool, 

And the stars were gone, 
I arose exultant, 

Like a man new-bom. 

But my friend and master. 

Heavy-limbed and spent. 
Turned, as one must turn at last 

From the sacrament; 
And his eyes were deep with God's 

Burning discontent. 


DuBose Heyward 



BCATINS 



I saw you pray today 

Out in the park — 
Poor little storm-driven 

Child of the dark. 

Body to earth you lay 

On the young grass, 
Learning the shining way 

April may pass. 

I saw the clear song 

Cardinals make 
Brush your face tangibly. 

Like wind on the lake. 

Then, in the hedge 

Where japonicas grew, 
A little breeze was born. 

Boyish and new. 

I saw it find you 

And rustle your name; 
Lift you, and carry you 

Like a slim flame 

Out where the trees break. 

Leaving wide skies. 
Now I sec always 

The prayer in your eyes. DuBose Heyward 
THE SEAJSLANDS 

SHADOWS 

There is deliberateness in all sea-island ways> 

CXitlandish to our days as stone wheels are. 

The islands cannot see the use of life 

Which only lives for change; 

Their days are flat. 

And all things there move slowly. 

Even the seasons are conservative — 

No sudden flaunting of wild colors in the fall, 

Only a gradual fading of the green. 

As if the earth turned slowly. 

Or looked with one still face upon the sun 

As Venus does; 

Until the trees, the fields, the marshes. 

All turn dun, dull Quaker brown. 

And a mild winter settles down. 

And mosses are more gray. 

All human souls are glasses which reflect 

The aspects of the outer world. 

See what terrible gods the huge Himalayas bred!- 

And the fierce Jewish Jaywah came 

From the hot Syrian desert 

With his inhibitory decalogue. 

The gods of little hills are always tame; 

Here God is dull, where all things stay the same. 


Hervey Allen 

No change on these sea-islands! 

The huge piled clouds range 

White in the cobalt sky; 

The moss hangs. 

And the strong tiring sea-winds blow — 

While day on glistering day goes by. 

The horses plow with hanging heads — 

Slow, followed by a black-faced man. 

Indifferent to the sun. 

The old cotton bushes hang with whitened heads; 

And there among the live-oak trees 

Peep the small whitewashed cabins, 

Painted blue perhaps, with scarlet-turbaned women, 

Ample-hipped, with voices soft and warm; 

And the lean hounds and chocolate children swarm. 

Day after day the ocean pumps 

The awful valve-gates of his heart, 

Diastole and systole through these estuaries; 

The tides flow in long gray weed-streaked lines; 

The salt water, like the planet's lifeblood, goes 

As if the earth were breathing with long-taken breaths 

And we were very near her heart. 

No wonder that these faces show a tired dismay. 
Looking on burning suns, and scarcely blithe in May. 
Spring's coming is too fierce with life, 
And summer is too long; 

The stunted pine trees struggle with the sand 
Till the eyes sicken with their dwarfing strife. 

There are old women here among these island homes. 

With dull brown eyes that look at something gray. 

And tight silver hair, drawn back in lines, 

Like the beach grass that's always blown one way; 

With such a melancholy in their faces 

I know that they have lived long in these places^ 

The tides, the hooting owls, the daylight moons. 

The leprous lights and shadows of the mosses, 

The funereal woodlands of these coasts. 

Draped like a hearse. 

And memories of an old war's ancient losses, 

Dwell in their faces' shadows like gray ghosts. 

And worse — 

The terror of the black man always near. 

The drab level of the rice-fields and the marsh 

Lend them a mask of fear. 



SUNSHIKE 

Do you suppose the sun here lavishes his heat 

For nothing in these islands by the sea? 

No! The great green-mottled melons ripen in the fields, 

Bleeding with scarlet juicy pith deliciously; 

And the exuberant yams grow golden, thick and sweet; 


Hervey Allen 



And white potatoes in grave-rows. 
With leaves as rough as cat-tongues, 
And pearly onions and cabbages 
With white flesh sweet as chicken-meat. 

These the black boatmen bring to town 

On barges, heaped with severed breasts of leaves, 

Driven by put-put engines 

Down the long canals quavering with song. 

With hail and chuckle to the docks along; 

Seeing their dark faces down below 

Reduplicated in the sunset glow, 

While from the shore stretch out the quivering lines 

Of the flat palm-like reflected pines 

That inland lie like ranges of dark hills in lines. 

And so to town — 

Weaving odd baskets of sweet grass 

Lazily and slow. 

To sell in the arcaded market 

Where men sold their fathers not so long ago. 

For all their poverty. 

These patient black men live 

A life rich in warm colors of the fields. 

Sunshine and hearty foods; 

Delighted with the gifts that earth can give, 

And old tales of Plateye and Brc*r Rabbit; 

While the golden-velvet cornpone browns 

Underneath the lid among hot ashes, 

Where the groundnuts roast 

Round shadowy fires at nights — 

With tales of graveyard ghost, 

While eery spirituals ring 

And organ voices sing, 

And sticks knock maddening rhythms on the floor 

To shuffling youngsters "cutting" buck-and-wing; 

Dogs bark; 

And woolly pickaninnies peek about the door. 

Sundays, along the moss-draped roads. 

The beribboned black folk go to church 

By threes and twos, carrying their shoes; 

With orange turbans, ginghams, rainbow hats. 

Then bucks flaunt tiger-lily ties and cobalt suits. 

Smoking cob pipes and faintly sweet cheroots. 

Wagons with oval wheels and kitchen chairs screech by, 

Where Joseph-coated white-teethed maidens sit 

Demurely, 

While the old mule rolls back the ivory of his eye. 

Soon from the whitewashed churches roll away. 

Among the live-oak trees. 

Rivers of melancholy harmonies. 

Full of the sorrows of the centuries 

The white man hears, but cannot feel. 

But it is always Sunday on sea-islands. 
Plantation bells, calling the pickers from the fields. 
Are like old temple gongs; 

[lO] 



 



Hervey Allen 



And the wind tells monodies among the pines. 

Playing upon their strings the ocean's songs. 

The ducks fly in long trailing lines; 

Geese honk and marsh-hens quank 

Among the tidal flats and rushes rank on rank. 

On island tufts the heron feeds its viscid young, 

And the quick mocker catches 

From lips of sons of slaves the eery snatches 

And trolls them as no lips have ever sung. 

Oh, it is good to be here in the spring. 

When water still stays solid in the North, 

When the first jasmine rings its golden bells. 

And the wild wistaria puts forth; 

But most because the sea then changes tone — 

Talking a whit less drear. 

It gossips in a smoother monotone. 

Whispering moon-scandal in the old earth's ear. 



MACABRE IN MACAWS 

After the hurricane of the late forties, 

Peter Polite says, in the live-oak trees 

Were weird macabre macaws. 

And ash-colored cockatoos blown overseas 

From Nassau and the West Indies. 

These hopped about like dead men's thoughts 

[II] 




 

Amid the draggled Spanish moss> 

Preening themselves, all at a loss; 

Mewing faint caws. 

And shrieking with nostalgia — 

With dull screams like a child 

Born with neuralgia. 

And this seems true to me, 

Fitting the landscape's drab grotesquery. 



HAG-HOLLERIN TIME 

Black Julius peered out from the galley door; 

Behind Jim Island, lying long and dim. 

An infra owl-light tinged the twilight sky 

As if a bonfire burned for cherubim. 

Dark orange flames came leering through the pines; 

And then the moon's face, struggling with a sneeze, 

Along the flat horizon's level lines 

Her nostrils fingered with palmetto trees. 

Her platinum wand made water-wrinkles buckle. 
Old Julius gave appreciative chuckle — 
"It's jes about hag-hollerin' time," he said. 
I watched the globous buckeyes in his head 
Peer back along the bloody moon-wash dim 
To see the fish-tailed water-witches swim. 


Hervey Allen 

UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS 

The judge^ who lives impeccably upstairs 
W\t)i dull decorum and its implication. 
Has all his servants in to family prayers 
And edifies his soul with exhortation. 
Meanwhile, his blacky live wastefully downstairs; 
Not always chaste, they manage to exist 
With less decorum than the judge upstairs, 
And find withal a something that he missed. 

This painful fact a Swede philosopher. 
Who tarried for a fortnight in our city. 
Remarked one evening at the meal, before 
We paralyzed him silent with our pity; 
Saying the black man, living with the white. 
Had given more than white men could requite. 



PALMETTO TOWN 

Sea4sland winds sweep through Palmetto Town, 

Bringing with piny tang the old romance 

Of pirates and of smuggling gentlemen; 

And tonnes as languorous as southern France 

Flow down her streets like water-talk at fords; 

While through iron gates where pickaninnies sprawl 

The sound comes back, in rippled banjo chords. 




 

From lush magnolia shades where mockers call. 

Mornings, the flower-women bring their wares — 

Bronze caryatids of a genial race,' 

Bearing the bloom-heaped baskets on their heads; 

Lithe, with their arms akimbo in wide grace, 

Their jasmine nodding jestingly at cares. 

Turbaned they are, deep-chested, straight and tall, 

Bandying old English words now seldom heard 

But sweet as Provencal. 

Dreams peer like prisoners through her harp-like gates 

From molten gardens mottled with gray gloom. 

Where lichened sundials shadow ancient dates, 

And deep piazzas loom. 

Fringing her quays are frayed palmetto posts, 

Where clipper ships once moored along the ways. 

And fanlight doorways, sunstruck with old ghosts, 

Sicken with loves of her lost yesterdays. 

Often I halt upon some gabled walk. 

Thinking I see the ear-ringed picaroons. 

Slashed with a sash and Spanish folderols. 

Gambling for moidores or for gold doubloons. 

But they have gone where night goes after day; 

And the old streets are gay with whistled tunes, 

Bright with the lilt of scarlet parasols 

Carried by honey-voiced young octoroons. 

Hervey Allen 




HIGH TREES 

There is unprisoned day up there: 

The even flow of level lights. 
The passing of the wilder rains, 
The perfect circle of the world — 
These, and the longer ride with sun, 
The earlier tryst with stars. 
The virgin silver of the moon! 

It must be well to hear 
The broken song of trampled dust. 
The long complaint of streets. 
Soothed to uncertainty — 
Earth's weaving flutter laid aside 
Like a folded fan. 

See how deeply their lifted breasts 
Arc stirred! 

See how the highest leaf 
Fingers a star! 

Henry Bellamdnn 


TWO POEMS 

RECORDinON 

I have hailed you. 

Out of centuries, out of aeons, 

During this fractional part of an infinitesimal clock-tick 

of time, 
I have seen you, 
And hailed you. 

I have yearned toward you. 
Burning. 

I have looked into your eyes 

During this fractional part of an infinitesimal clock-tick 
of time. 

Quicker than the shadow of a monoplane 
Passing over the shadow of a humming-bird. 
Shall we two pass. 
And be to all men's memory 
Inconceivably remote. 

Yet it is recorded 

That out of all time, 

During this fractional part of an infinitesimal clock-tick 

of time, 
I have seen you and hailed you. 
It is recorded! 

[i6] 



 



Marx G. Sabel 



THE CORE 

I have won free of your body at last; 

The fire and ice of it 
Can neither burn nor freeze me fast. 

I look upon you now no whit 

Afraid, for I do not desire: 

And yet, what is the benefit? 

I still must worship; something higher 

Impels me youward constantly. 
Yet I am fagot for a fire 

The heat of which is of such degree 
That I shrivel painlessly therein; 
And I am flower for a sea 

So cold all things that find it win 

To death without the slightest change. 
Although I have torn the cabals of sin, 

I drift beyond the senses' range 

In spiritual perfectness 
To lands remote, grotesquely strange. 

That thrill my passions now no less 

Than even your beauty thrilled before. 
But this, this joy, is fathomless; 

More certain^ steadfast, deeper, more 

Inexorable, and it demands 
The core of what we thought the core! 

You cannot touch it with your hands, 
You cannot see it with your eyes: 

Only your soul that understands 
May teach you its divinities! 



Marx G. Sabel 



WHEN LOVE IS GONE 

I am as a field of grass 
Over which the hot winds pass — 
I am bowed. 

As an organ left alone — 
Organist and songs long gone — 
I am dumb. 

I am as a goblet dried, 
Wine-stained crystal rim and side: 
I am drained. 

As the ashes dead and gray 
When the fire has burned away, 
I am cold. 

Louise Jones 

[i8] 



 



VERSES 

IMPRESSIONS 

I feel the sands of time 
Crunch beneath my feet — 

Out on the open road 
Or in the narrow street. 

And when my heart is glad 

My foot-prints are light, 
Tracing faintly the sands 

That glitter cool and white. 

But when my soul is sad 

Heavy sinks my tread — 
Deep furrows in the dank 

Dark sands where lie the dead. 

RECOGNITION 

Disguised, a little hope 
Came to my door one day. 

And begged for food and drink, 
And pled to stay. 

Frightened, my heart said, "Wait — 

He may be born of sin.*' 
But then my soul sang out, 

"Come in, come in.** 

TWILIGHT 

The grey-cloaked dusk 

Is like a nun; 
Her hands folded. 

Her prayers done. 

In that hushed hour 

She seems to wait, 
Kneeling beside 

The convent gate. 



DEATH 

Driftwood am I, 

And oblivion seems like the sea 
That comes creeping, creeping 

Nearer to me. 

Some day a wave 

Will pass all the others by. 
And come lapping, lapping 

To where I lie. 

Then on the tide 

I shall be taken out to sea. 
Until nothing, nothing 

Is left of me. 


Eifrida De Renne Barrow 

I WONDER 

My heart is a small room, 

And life is the light of day 
That peeps in through the window 

Joyous and gay. 

When Time draws down the blind 

And leaves me to the night, 
Will God come then, I wonder, 

And bring me light? 

Eifrida De Renne Barrow 



SPRING MAKES ME WONDER 

Always my love for you 

Was an escaping thing, 

Like gray smoke seen through half-green boughs; 

Or the shadow of gray smoke wavering 

On the bare ground of spring. 

Why was it never joy — 

Clear joy of looking up 

Through drifts of porcelain-white plum-blossoms 

Into the sky*s blue cup? 

Josephine Pinckney 


POETRY; A Magazine of Verse 
MARSH SKETCHES 



SEA MARSH 



Like a woman who remembers 
Is the marsh — 

^A woman who forgives, and yet 
Whose every mood is dimmed 
Because, forgiving. 
She cannot ever quite forget. 

None knows her secret heart — 

One can but guess 

What crying winds have stirred 

To dumb distress 

Her quietness; 

What sodden rains have trampled her; 

What lust of August suns. 

She has no words: 

Impassive, inarticulate 

Save for the flight of birds — 

Slow heron, slumbrous crane — 

She keeps her counsel. 

Though cities bloom and fade 

And forests fall, 

She does not change; 

The slow years pause . . . pass. 

And leave no trace — 


Frances Dickenson Finder 



Like snowflakes on a peasant's face. 

So long 

The seasons have defrauded her, 

There is no festival 

Upon her calendar; 

In spring, no hint of welcoming 

For the few flowers 

That seek her smile; 

No song upon her lips . . . 

How should she sing? 

For nothing whole is hers. 

No perfect gift — 

Only the spent and broken things 

That drift 

In from the unrepentant sea. 



MARSH POOLS 

And now I know 

Where are those stars 

That slip like jewels 

Between the night's 

Most jealous fingers. 

At dusk I found them, 

Where the marsh had hidden them— 

In a silver pocket 

Of her grey-green gown! 

SHALLOWS 

I must swim out — 
Overlong have I stayed 
Here on the warm shale; 
Aimlessly played. ... 
Gathering sea-shells 
Empty and frail. 

One dwindles here 
Where the tides creep — 
Grows dazzled, 

Gazing too long through the clear 
Wave at the sun asleep 
On the sands overnear. . . . 
What if the thought of the deep 
Should become a fear? 

I must swim out — 
Lest the urge fail. 
Darken duskward 
And fade, as a sail.

TWO POEMS 



OPEN A DOOR 



Open a door suddenly. 

And you may see 
Loved ones whom you call dead 

Happy and free. 

Listen — oh, stealthily! — 

You'll find it true, 
These whom you weep for 

Are pitying you. 

Close the door softly, 

Lest they may learn 
They have been spied on, 

And never return. 

JENICE 

If Jenice dies, who is as white 

As apple blossoms blanched by night — 

If Jenice dies, what shall I care 

If there be beauty everywhere? 

All beauty will be dead for me — 

The silver moonlight on the sea, 

The shining glory of the skies, 

Will die for me if Jenice dies.

TIDEWATER 

HARBOR WATER 

All through the night I can hear the sound of dancers, 
Soft-padding hoofs, and the lipping of the water, 
The water, the water patting juba , . . 

Juba! Juba! 

Juba lef arC juba right y 

Juba dance on a moonshine night — 

Juba! 

Knobbly palmetto posts. 

Matted trunks of sea-gods. 

Hairier than monkeys, rise from the water — 

The pulpy, the oily-burnished water. 

Soft rocking feet of the dancers sway about them, 
Long-swelling ripples with their crisp inhibitions. 
Filed golden streaks like the pointed feet of dancers, 
Pull of the tide, and the netted flopping motion 
Of the water, the music-woven, oily-damasked water. 
Water patting juba. . . . 

Juba! Juba! 

Juba lef an* juba rights 

Juba dance on a moonshine night — 

Juba!

WHITE AZALEAS IN MAGNOLIA GARDENS 

Your images in water! Sea-shell gray 

And iridescence; like the endless spawn 

Of pale sea-jellies on a moonless night — . 

A milky way that glamours out of sight — 

Something of sea and something of the sky. 

Drawn from the earth as blossoming dreams are drawn. 

Most strange are you in this, that dreams alight and fly, 

But you dream on all your translucent day. 

Sweeps of divinest nothingness, abyss 
Of beauty, you are the stirred, subconscious place 
Of flowers, you are the rathe and virgin mood 
Of young azaleas. 

Where heaped branches brood 
Like bathers, water-girdled to the hips. 
Like Undines, every blossom turns her face 
Groping above the water, with her parted, winged, insati- 
able lips. 
Each for her soul and its white mysteries. 



DEW 

The new morning light is a primitive, 
A painter of faintly-filled outlines, 
A singer of folk-songs. 




 

The dew-flattened vines by my window 
Are all of one innocent green. 
Nothing so young as that ^een — 
An outline cut by a child 

From a soft new blotter. 

But when the light grows, 
They suck up a pert chiaroscuro — 
Gold, meretricious, knowing high-lights, 
Hopelessly clever. 

Their poems 
Dry in the sun. 



THE ONLY CHILD 

You are not one child only. 
Little one, daughter my dear — 

Hundreds of shadowy children 
Follow you everywhere. 

Babies in twilighted corners 
Play with your outgrown things; 

They whisper forgotten stories. 
They dance in gossamer rings. 

Hundreds of outgrown children 
Lxx)k from your candid <eyes; 


Beatrice Ravenel 



Butterfly, ceaselessly living 
In a swarming of butterflies. 

You race through the garden doorway. 
And swift, like a silvery band, 

The cobweb of children is after you . . 
But the last one holds my hand. 



LILL ANGELS 

Mammy rocks the baby 

In the wallflower-colored gloom; 
All the floor rocks with her. 

And the slumber of the room. 
Like the broad, unceasing trade-wind, 

Like the rivers underground. 
Rolls the universal rhythm 
And the rich, primeval sound: 
All de liir angels.

COMMENT 

THIS SOUTHERN NUMBER 

EVER since Poetry began, it has believed in, and tried 
to encourage, a strongly localized indigenous art. 
Such art may not produce masterpieces — the gods alone 
decide that; but no one can deny that the world's most 
precious masterpieces — such things as Dante, Homer, 
Rembrandt, or the old Egyptian sculptors have left us — 
sprang out of intensely local loyalties, and attained to 
universality because the locale, grandly handled, becomes 
as wide as the earth; and a great master's neighbors, 
re-created in his art, will speak, to the end of time, for 
the whole human race. Today especially art needs to 
concentrate on the locale against the generalizing, scat- 
tering tendencies of the age; else it is in danger of becom- 
ing vague and diilused and theoretic, of losing precision 
and vitality. 

So it is consistent that we should offer our readers this 
Southern Number, and should request two leaders of the 
Poetry Society of South Carolina to share its editorship 
with our usual staff. No one can go talking about 
poetry through the states of our south-eastern coast, as 
I did a year ago, without feeling that the local loyalties, 
always dramatically intense in that r^ion, are turning 
with deep enthusiasm toward the arts. The people are 
beginning to realize what wonderful material has been 

awaiting observant eyes and creative minds: romantic 
episodes of early history and legend, involving three 
strongly contrasted races; plantation life and city life and 
sea life, with all their bewildering changes through three 
centuries of valiant history; a landscape of languorous 
beauty, melting into the vividly colored tropical ocean 
along white stretches of sand; and a proud people who 
have always commanded life a bit cavalierly, contrasted 
with the sweetly indolent, humorous, more or less loyally 
subservient African. 

All this has waited long for its interpreters, for the 
South — this particular South especially — held more firmly 
than any other section of the country to eighteenth- 
century literary manners and Victorian sentimentalities. 
Two southern poets escaped the thraldom, of course: 
Poc by sheer force of genius driven by egoistic will; and 
Lanier by good taste and a high order of poetic instinct. 
Both spent most of their lives in the neighborhood of 
Baltimore, but more tropical sojourn in the Carolinas and 
Georgia strongly influenced their imaginations. 

But Poe was an individualist rather than an interpreter; 
his high lyric strain was an intensely personal magic — 
coloraturii of surpassing brilliancy and of an exquisite 
melancholy beauty. It is as southern as Charleston's 
moss-hung "Magnolia Gardens'*; and the refuge it creates 
is as unreal, as weirdly remote from earth. While one 
should know that particular South to understand Poe's 
spiritual sources and sympathies, one sees his proud and 


This Southern Numbef 

tragic figure slip through like a ghost, haunting but 
touching not the life around him. 

Nor did Lanier attempt the story. His finely obser- 
vant mind delighted in nature, and he remains essentially 
a landscape poet; establishing, in such poems as The 
Marshes of Gfynrty the rather narrow limitations of his 
lofty spirit and delicately sensitive talent. A worshipper 
of beauty was Lanier — a true poet, but hardly a great one. 

Much remains to be said for this South in the arts. 
For a long time its people were scarcely aware of this 
fact; preoccupied with recovery from a destructive war, 
they were indiflFerent to the arts. Now theii; attitude is 
becoming expectant; they are at least preparing the way 
for the poets, painters and other artists who shall speak 
for them. Local exhibitions are being held, beautiful old 
houses are being preserved and restored; and poetry 
societies in various cities are gathering together and 
encouraging the poets who may yet immortalize their 
place and hour. 

Of these the Poetry Society of South Carolina, thus far 
the most important, is exerting an influence which may 
yet be felt throughout the South. It is appropriate that 
this society should be centralized in Charleston, for, as an 
observer said recently, 

Charleston is the logical centre for this poetical renaissance, because 
the old culture, which is the only thing capable of bringing forth the 
new, is stronger there than in any other southern city, not excepting 
Richmond. 

This society is well organized and intelligently con- 
ducted, offering the stimulus of criticism, lectures, local 
contests and prizes, with the Blindman Prize of two 
hundred and fifty dollars as an annual invitation to poets 
far and near. 

The groups in Columbia, Savannah and Jacksonville 
are near neighbors of the Charleston society, and closely 
affiliated with it. Its example has been felt as far away 
as the Lone Star State, for the Poetry Society of Texas, 
with similar aims, is being organized by Mrs. Therese 
Lindsey, of Houston, and others. Texas indeed has been 
keenly hospitable to modern poets and the ideas they 
represent; many of the more prominent ones are familiar 
figures in Dallas, Austin, Waco, San Antonio and other 
cities. 

The present number attempts to represent the south- 
eastern groups — of the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida. 
The poems which we print by Mr. Heyward and Mr. 
Allen come, with one exception, from their projected 
book of Carolina Chansons y to be published next autumn; 
which will endeavor to remind their neighbors, and those 
further north as well, of the heroic history and romantic 
legendry of this region, much of which will fade from 
human memory unless the poets make it live.

Poetry South 

POETRY SOUTH 

It is a truism that creative art from its very nature 
must be original, the peculiarly different and unexpected 
reaction of the artist to his environment. This is es- 
pecially true of poetry, the least concrete of the arts; and 
it is this very quality of unexpectedness in the poet, 
constituting as it does so much of the charm of poetry, 
that makes an attempt to forecast the reactions of any 
group or school of poets a task which calls for the prophetic 
rather than for the merely constructive critic. 

Nevertheless, poets as a rule are so profoundly affected 
by their environment that by understanding it, if we can- 
not precisely predict their reactions, we can at least say 
within limits what they will not write about, and perhaps 
even be able to forecast the general tendencies of a school 
or group in its day and place. If, in addition to the 
physical environment, we have also some grasp of the 
historical and ethnic background from which poets speak, 
some comprehension of the immediate social and local 
problems which surround them — in short, some knowledge 
of the poets themselves — we shall be able, to a large extent, 
to tell not only what subjects they will be most likely to 
select, but also, in a more limited sense, in what mood 
they will approach their theme; and from mood their style, 
for it is mood that dictates style. 

It is from this standpoint of physical and spiritual 
environment, from the historical background, and from 

a survey of the tendencies evident in the verse being 
written by southern poets today, that this cursory presen- 
tation of the condition of poetry in the South is attempted. 
In so brief a space its statements must be rather general, 
with all the many exceptions implied. 

Despite some vigorous assertions to the contrary, it 
seems as if southern poetry were going to be decidedly 
regional in spirit, with a quick human appeal but strongly 
local in tone — poetry of and about places. Much of 
American verse is city poetry. It is the similarity of 
our city life perhaps which has given to a great deal of 
American verse a note of sameness that is too often mis- 
taken for a universal realistic appeal. The city, too, has 
given American poetry a tendency to mirror back the 
drab, and accentuated an almost morbid desire for self- 
esqpression which the crowd begets. There has been, to 
be sure, a gain in thought-content and sophistication, 
but the spontaneous and simple have been sacrificed, 
while the constant search for the "new" has brought 
about a ceaseless experiment with alien forms. It seems 
probable that poetry written from the South will be, in 
nearly all these respects, the opposite of what has rather 
arbitrarily been called "city-verse," for the South is still 
predominantly agricultural. Although industrialism, un- 
der the spur of northern capital, has ridden in ruthlessly 
here and there, the plantation of one kind or another is 
still the economic, vital unit; and it may be expected that 
when the plantation poet speaks, it will not be from the 


Poetry South 

necessity of introspectively asserting his existence as an 
individual apart from the crowd, but of objectively 
reflecting in simple measures the patriarchal life remnant 
about him. In this he will very likely be profoundly 
impressed by his sub-tropical or mountain landscapes, 
and reflect the spontaneously lyrical and primarily 
rhythmic melodies of the Negro. Indeed, the effect of 
the Negro on southern poetry demands a treatment by 
itself. 

It is significant that the syncopation of the Negro, 
which has found its way into "jazz" music and verse, 
has seldom been adopted by southern poets. This is 
partly due to a "subconscious-intellectual" color-line, for 
strong social and racial prejudices are carried over into 
art; but to a still greater extent the omission of "jazz" in 
southern poetry is due to the fact that the short, choppy 
eflFects of syncopated rhythms do not lend themselves to 
the intimate mood of memory and contemplation which 
the South has to express. Therefore, the more obvious 
employment of Negro rhythms, and the attempts to gain 
the ear by poems in unauthentic dialect must not be 
overestimated. Due credit must be given, however, to 
the Valentine Museum of Richmond for its publication 
of authentic Negro dialect-poetry, and its experiments 
in recording for phonographic reproduction the exact 
sound of the passing speech of the old Negro. Thomas 
Nelson Page of Virginia, Harry Stillwell Edwards and 
Joel Chandler Harris of Georgia, and Janie Screven Hey- 

ward of the South Carolina coast country, together with 
a few others, are deserving of mention for having created 
literature which correctly records the Negro dialect of 
their own localities. 

The southern muse must be careful how she handles 
the tar-baby; but the weird, the bizarre and the gro- 
tesque in Negro life and story, and the tone of the 
"spiritual" will have to be reckoned with — indeed, they 
have already made themselves felt. With the N^ro, 
poetry, music and the dance are still closely associated, 
as in all primitive races, and in the recognition and per- 
petuation of this condition lies a great opportunity for 
American art in the South. It is much to be desired 
that the southern group may recognize this immense fund 
of rich material for poetry which Negro music, legends and 
folk-lore hold in trust, and that the time may rapidly 
come when there will be Negro poets who can use ad- 
equately the artistic values inherent in their own race, 
and produce something worthy. Unfortunately Paul 
Lawrence Dunbar stands almost alone; his was a unique 
contribution to literature, as Tanner's has been to painting. 

The Negro, however, is not the only source of folk-lore 
in the South. Even richer in poetic material is the lofty 
back-country of the Appalachians. The rush of Ameri- 
can civilization has thus far touched only the fringes of 
this rugged land. Today one may take a trail from one 
of the mountain towns, and by traveling horseback for 
fifty miles in from the railroad he will discover for him- 


Poetry South 

self an eighteenth-century pioneer settlement; provided 
he is not mistaken for a revenue officer, and his route 
subjected to an immediate change of destination. 

The mountains of the Carolinas and Kentucky were 
settled in the days of Daniel Boone and earlier by sturdy 
Scotch-Irish and English pioneers who built their isolated 
settlements behind the ramparts of rock. There, se- 
questered from the flow and change of civilization, they 
have continued to live the life of the pioneer. There are 
certain remote districts in the Black and Great Smoky 
ranges where life has remained absolutely static for a 
century and a half. There it is still possible to hear old 
English ballads and folk-tales which passed from current 
use generations ago; and one still encounters Elizabethan 
words. Certainly nowhere else in the America of today 
can one find conditions so favorable to the development 
of genuine folk-expression; with the background of an 
old, but still remembered civilization, and an absolute 
isolation which encourages the crystallization, by word of 
mouth, of the idea into the story. 

The mountaineer responds but little to beauty. In his 
great tumble of hills, which contains forty-six peaks of 
over six thousand feet, including the highest point east 
of the Rocky Mountains, amid a flora that is bewildering 
in its pageantry of color, he is stubborn, vindictive in 
anger, elemental as a child in his amusements, shrewd, 
silent, and unerring in his estimate of the "furreners'' 
he may chance to meet. It should be added here, by way 

of extenuation, that the mountaineer is naturally on the 
defensive. Living as he does by a code of ethics and 
morals out of the past, he finds himself contending with 
the incursions of the present, and he knows instinctively 
that he is at a disadvantage. 

But it is among the mountdn women that one finds 
the pathos and tragedy of these isolated people. Burden- 
bearers, tillers of the soil, the women are old at thirty. 
Their faces tell nothing of their thoughts, but there is 
always a characteristic quality to the speaking voice: 
the tone is low, soft and drawling, invariably dropping 
to a lower key at the end of every remark, with an effect 
of hopelessness and infinite sadness. 

The only emotional outlet for the mountaineer is the 
religious revival, and the occasional neighborhood dance. 
To both of these forms of entertainment he responds with 
the greatest gusto, and the extreme revivalist sects, such 
as the "Holiness" and the "Holy Rollers," have made 
many profitable excursions into his fastnesses. But such 
outbursts can not long combat the native reticence of 
the people, and they soon become self-conscious and 
indifferent. 

In spite of the fact that the southern mountaineer is 
probably the most interesting and least known figure in 
our national life, it will be many years before he will 
write his own story, if ever. The lack of schools, and his 
rooted indifference to educational advantages, will keep 
him much as he is, but he should be transcribed through 


Poetry South 

the medium of some art before he passes; for there is 
nothing else quite like him on the continent. 

The statement has been made earlier that southern 
poetry may be largely of and about places. If environ- 
ment is going to affect our southern poets, if they are 
going to be at all objective, this will necessarily follow, 
for there is no other portion of the country. so districted — 
i. e., where sections differ so one from the other as in the 
South. To pass from the country of the mountain-whites 
to the Carolina Low Country, for example, is to pass 
from one world to another, one with a di£ferent fauna and 
flora and a different ethnic background. Here the poets 
may tell of the sea-islands, with tidal lagoons where the 
wild-fowl, ducks, marsh-hens, and strange gawky heron 
feed, and the migrating song-birds pass through each 
year like a recurring flame. They may speak of magnolia 
and azalea gardens, oriental in a polychromatic spring; 
of swamps and eerie live-oak forests where the Spanish 
moss hangs like stalactites in twilit caverns; of the miles 
of deserted rice-fields where turbaned blacks walk ruined 
dykes; and of the ancient baronies and manors, each with 
its legend, where the deer feed around the stately columned 
houses — ^shells of a life and an epoch which have passed 
away. 

But if the past does not call the southern poet, the 
thrusting of industrialism into the Piedmont cotton and 
tobacco regions, with the rise of the factory system, 
child-labor, and a burning racial problem, o£fer a tre- 




 

mendous « theme and a possible chance of legitimate 
propaganda for the present. Then in Florida, at such 
towns as Miami, a frontier is being peacefully settled, 
and dotted with villas Roman in their scale and mag- 
nificence; while from the Everglades the firelight of the 
stone-age Seminole glows in the midnight sky when he 
holds his secret corn-dances. Southward stretch the coral 
keys, haunted by huge sea-turtles, that crawl out to hide 
their eggs where pirates once hid gold; and even today 
the eagle boat of the whiskey-runner shelters there, 
making for Nassau or Bimini. Then there are the plains 
of Texas rich with the diisty-golden dreams of Spanish 
. empire, with enchanted mesas, pueblos, Indian stories 
and cow-boy songs; or the cane-brakes of Louisiana, and 
faded Creole New Orleans of the old river days. 

How absurd to say the South has nothing but genealogy ! 
Who will sing of them, these cities — of Santa Fe or El 
Paso, San Antonio or St. Augustine, and of old Charleston 
with her three hundred years of memories? Who is 
going to write the epos of Coronado, of the lost Fountain 
of Youth, of De Soto, of the pirates, of Africa trans- 
planted, of the outlandish voodoo that still lingers, and 
of the strange new Christ the Negroes worship? Is there 
no one who will tell over again from the clearer light of a 
better time how the awful, keen sword of civil war struck 
down these states, how the slave and freedman passed, 
and how through bitterness they have come to a saner, 
sweeter life again? Here is a challenge to the American 


Poetry South 

renascence. It is ardently to be hoped that the South 
will continue to reply to it as she has begun to do, and 
that she will give us largely of her rich landscapes and 
historical material, and speak of and from the life of her 
memory and of her present. And it is also to be hoped 
that the cleverly inane, or the small accidental dream-life 
of the individual, so seldom worth uttering — tiny loves 
and smaller hates, and the baldly phrased usual; above 
all, the banal echo and the purely sentimental — will be 
left unsaid. 

Faked sympathy, and crocodile tears for the past, are 
the stops which the southern poets must most carefully 
avoid. Unfortunately, the vox humana, pulled out full, is 
still good for a round of applause almost anywhere, but 
in the South there is an inherited bias in its favor. 

In colonial times no other section of the country was so 
much affected by the eighteenth-century classical school 
as the South, particularly the Carolinas and Virginia. 
New England seems to have preserved and perpetuated, 
almost down to modern times, the spirit of the Puritan 
seventeenth-century literature, but in the South your 
Cavalier gendeman imported his advance leaves of the 
"latest books published in the United Kingdom," had 
them specially bound, added his book-mark; and read his 
Pope, his Johnson, and his Goldsmith, not always his 
Burke, with complete satisfaction. Education and plan- 
tation tutoring were largely in the dead languages; and in 
South Carolina the old Huguenot French stock read the 

French Bible, Voltaire or Rousseau according to their 
generation. Nowhere was the eflFect upon originality of 
style more blighting. Almost until the civil war the 
couplet of Pope held fall sway — the English romantic 
movement seems to have had little effect upon it; verse 
remained an accomplishment of the idle and the polite, 
extremely sentimental and absolutely eighteenth-century 
in style. Even today the old idea that there is a distinct 
poetic jargon persists in the South, and realism in poetry 
shocks the academic sense, while in files of old newspapers 
and privately printed books that throng second*hand 
book-stalls these old voices still tinkle from the dust in 
their endless couplets. In the aggregate an astonishing 
amount of such verse was written. Take General Albert 
Pike's Hymns to the GodSy for instance; and William 
Gilmore Simms, who heads the list with eighteen volumes. 
How many single poems survive today? 

Poe stands out from this crowd of gentlemen poetasters 
as the great exception. He actually developed his own 
forms, not turning to new forms but improving on the 
old. He reflected the life about him; for his poems are 
much more biographical than is generally suspected, and 
most of his verse shows strong southern influence in 
landscape and rhythms. Nevertheless, he also did not 
escape tradition entirely, and partly for that reason he 
seems more European now than American, but none the 
less great for that. 

It took the civil war to goad southern poets into an 


Poetry South 

authentic local utterance, although there were a few years, 
just before 1861, when it seemed as if the Charleston 
group — ^Hayne, Timrod, Simms, and some others — would 
make that city a southern literary capital. A magazine, 
RusselFsy was started there under much the same kind 
of impulse as the Atlantic Monthly; but Sumter was fired 
on, and the war put a period to all such activity. Both 
Hayne and Timrod dealt with landscapes and nature, 
but they are chiefly remembered for their war poems, 
and because, with a very few others, they were the only 
voices which to any degree adequatdy phrased the despair 
of reconstruction. Timrod once wrote to Hayne: "I can 
embody it all in a few words — beggary, starvation, death, 
bitter grief, utter want of hope." It is impossible to 
judge men writing under such conditions by the ordinary 
standards of criticism. The wonder that they wrote at 
all is only transcended by the miracle that they also 
achieved some memorable lines. 

Art, as it is the finest expression of the life of a people, 
is the last thing to recover from the ravages of war. 
Reconstruction, with its spiritual and economic despair, 
put a gag in the mouths of singers; the few voices that did 
speak were more like croaks than songs. However, one 
ludicrous little man by the name of Coogler, in Columbia, 
S. C, conferred five volumes upon a faintly amused world: 

Maude — for her gentle name was Maude — 
Wore many smiles, and diey were sad; 

A thousand virtues she possessed. 
Many of which I never had. 

This, in its own way, is really great, and the last two 

lines could have stood truthfiilly for the relation 

of the southern poet of that time to his muse; for these 

were the days when prejudices, and the heritage of war, 

were too strong to permit of literature being written. 

Shakespeare himself would have been taboo on account 

of the Dark Lady of the Sonnets. That Sidney Lanier 

should have spoken out of this environment is all the more 

wonderful. He was indeed a protest against his age 

north and south: 

O Trade! OTradel would thou wert dead! 
The time needs heart— 'ds tired of head. 

Like Poe he developed his own style and theory of verse, 
and was not content simply to use the old forms as Hayne 
an4 Timrod had done. His knowledge of the two arts 
of music and verse largely made this possible. Lanier 
was too modern in one sense for his time, and too con- 
servative for the moderns. He worked against frightful 
physical and spiritual odds, in the seventies and eighties, 
and despite it all at times achieved great beauty. He 
and Poe are, of course, the great names the South has to 
oflFer to American poetry. Madison Cawein should not 
be forgotten. These men overcame literary taboos and 
traditions, and dared to have personality; with them 
poetry was not simply polite. 

The last few years have brought a new spirit into the 
South. With the recovery of her economic life has come 
the possibility of renewing the old culture, and an oppor- 


Poetry South 

tunity for a leisure not due to apathy and despair. The 
great war has also stirred and disturbed her subtly and 
immeasurably, till a vast territory which has for a while 
lain poetically fallow is now awakening, and from here 
and there voices, small and inadequate perhaps, but never- 
theless earnest and distinctive voices, are giving it 
utterance. 

It is their desire that the rest of the country know and 
recognize this; for while these voices may utter with a 
timbre peculiarly their own, it is because they are moved, 
not by a provincial pride, but by the renascence of poetry 
throughout America; and being so moved by this spirit, 
they claim to be of it. The South will never express 
itself in constricted forms; mood, inclination and tradi- 
tion forbid, nor does it feel the urge completely to slough 
the old. Here, where the tides of immigration have 
brought no alien tongues, the grand tradition of English 
poetry still lingers strongly in an old culture which has 
survived the wrack of civil war and of reconstruction — 
a European culture, planted by a strong stock in colonial 
times; and it is from this tradition and from the descend- 
ants of that stock that the southern poetical renascence 
must come. It will accept with modern spirit the new 
forms in verse, but accept them as being valuable for their 
loosening effect upon the old rather than as being all 
satisfactory in themselves; and it brings to American

POE IN SOUTH CAROLINA 

In May, 1828, Poe enlisted in the army under the name 
of Edgar A. Perry, and was assigned to Battery "H" of 
the First Artillery at Fort Independence. In October 
his" battery was ordered to Fort Moultrie, Charleston, 
S. C. Poe spent a whole year on Sullivan's Island. 
Professor C. Alphonso Smith, the well-known Poe author- 
ity, says: "So far as I know, this was the only tropical 
background that Poe had ever seen." That the sus- 
ceptible nature of the young poet was vastly impressed by 
the weirdness and melancholy scenery of the Carolina 
coast country, there can be little doubt. The dank tarns 
and funereal woodlands of his landscapes, or at least a 
strong suggestion of them, may all be found here. The 
scene of The Goldbug is definitely laid on Sullivan's 
Island; and here are dim family vaults and tracts of 
country in which the House of Usher might well stand. 

Dim vales and shadowy floods 
And cloudy-looking woods. 
Whose forms we can't discover, 
From the tears that drip all over — 

was written while Poe was in the army at Fort Moultrie, 

 



 



Poe in South Carolina 

and appeared in his second volume in 1829. There are 
later echoes: 

Around by lifting winds forgot, 

Resignedly beneath the sky> 

The melancholy waters lie.

REVIEWS 

A SONNETEER 

Poemsy by Stewart Mitchell. Duffield and Co. 

The sonnet in our time occupies a lonely and illusory 
pinnacle. Due to the obsolescence of other imposed 
verse-patterns, it is mistakenly considered a special 
province of poetic art, which it is not. It may be an 
important form only by virtue of its history: it is perhaps 
the only purely romantic system which has become 
entirely acclimated; in periods of great fecundity in our 
literature it has had the cry of fashion; it has attracted 
profound and celebrated writers. Sequences of sonnets 
have been substituted for that anom^y of our art, the 
long lyric, as in Christina Rossetti's Later Life and 
Donne's Holy Sonnets y probably the best we have. It 
is fortunately based on a ten-syllable line peculiarly 
pleasant in the English tongue. Within it one can 
experiment, as the Elizabethans did, in complex passions 
and subtle argument properly dramatic. It may be 
made the journal of an introspective or passionate life, 
as in Mr. Blunt's Proteus and Esther sequences. But 

its possible rhymes are easily exhaustible in our language, 
and thereafter reminiscent. Unlike its musical name- 
sake, the sonata, there is no esoteric logic or balance to 
govern it. Other forms, such as the sestina, may set 
a pace for more varied music. I suspect its present 
dismal distinction is due in part to the mere fact of its 
obsolescence. Modern sonnets are many, and usually 
mediocre. Each new bundle arouses one's hope: "Here, 
after all, at last, may be the real thing." 

One's hope is not altogether dashed by Stewart 
Mitchell's book, which contains about two dozen, although 
he does not invent a new music, or trouble the old un- 
subtle cadence. The effect, never achieved by this poet, 
of a truly great sonnet like Donne's Death Be Not Proud 
is produced by the clash of a surging internal movement 
upon or against the rigid scheme. Among contemporaries 
Miss Millay will best bear comparison with her masters 
in this respect. Sonneteers like Mitchell write too much 
"in the pattern," with a resultant tonal emptiness, or 
invirility. 

His art rather reeks of the intellect. Vision and pas- 
sion are strained through nets of speculation and sieves 
of analysis. Nothing actually escapes, or would seem 
quite to satisfy him. That any trace of ecstasy is hard 
to identify may be because he makes the mistake of 
codification inaccurately associated with the^» de siicle — 
with Ernest Dowson, the original work of that subtle 
translator Arthur Symons, et al. When human affairs 

[so] 



 



A Sonneteer 

are generalized into "parched desire," "redolent 
splendor," "pitiless fates," etc., the odd commonplace 
holds true that identity, force and conviction go out of 
them. Modes of thought and address, "preserved" 
as fruit is preserved, tend to limit the precision of verse 
as a means of communication. "The conditions of life 
pre-determined slavery to be easy and freedom hard," 
says Marianne Moore. One wearies, to the point of fury, 
of this brand of expressivism: 

Bring me, this evening, crimson wine 

Such as in twilight seems to keep 
Secrets of death in serpentine 

Sinuous sleep. 

At its best, however, this book is not an arid field for 
those who prefer the rewards of a discreet cultivated 
mind to the glare and quaver of more fickle if stronger 
imaginations. Glenway Wescott 

A FRENCH VICTORIAN 

Plays of Edmond Rostand^ translated by Henderson 
Daingerfield Norman. Illustrated by Ivan Glidden. 
Macmillan Co. 

In spite of certain confusions of idiom, this is a rather 
spirited translation of the most popular French play- 
wright of his day. It rhymes almost as lightly and easily 
as the original, and has a similar slam-bang movement, 
and the same flavor and color of swashbuckling, noisy 

romance. Rostand "put it over" adroitly with the 
crowd, almost persuaded his audiences that VAiglon 
was tragedy and Cyrano high comedy; and now that he 
is dead we have him Englished in extenso^ and majestically 
enthroned in an octavo edition, with illustrations of a 
naive sentimentality worthy of 1850. 

But already the tinsel is tarnished, and the loud fame 
of the dead poet slinks around the corner into the past. 
These plays, though of French origin, seem as Victorian 
as The Princess — they bear no relation to modern poetic 
or theatric art. 

The translator, in his preface, is at some pains to 
explain the meaning of Chantecler^ that subliminal 
mystery: "Like so much great poetry," he says, "its 
application is at once local and universal." We refer the 
faithful to his guidance; if anyone has failed to under- 
stand Chanteclery now is the time for enlightenment. 

"He meant much to the French," remarks one who 
knows them. Yes, he stressed certain conventions, 
certain traditions, as dear to the hearts of Frenchmen 
as the pioneer-cowboy convention, stressed by Service 
et al., is to our own. That he should further artifi- 
cialize these conventions was inevitable — a temperament 
of such romantic ardor must glamourize and melodrama- 
tize, must repay not only principal but interest. The 
public is always grateful for this service — great was 
Rostand's reward in his day. But the day was short — 
already it is a quaint yesterday. H. M. 


CORRESPONDENCE 

NOTES FROM THE P. S. JL. ANNUAL DINNER 

"Which way to the dinner?" we asked of the doorman 
at the Hotel Astor. 

" Which dinner do you want to go to ? ** he said, unrolling 
a long scroll; "the Shoe-lace and Ribbon Manufacturers' 
banquet, the wedding on the ninth floor . . . ?" 

"The Poetry dinner,'* we told him. 

"Central ballroom straight ahead." 

Stopped by a jazz band and loud applause, we asked 
again if that was the Poetry dinner. No, we were told, 
that was the Flower and Feather Manufacturers' banquet. 
The Poets' opened with organ music — their music was 
over. Centre door straight ahead. 

Yes, music for a long time was over — through a redun- 
dant parade of meats and sauces, and the polite murmur 
of poets and friends of poets; broken now and then by 
loud clapping from without, perhaps from the hip flasks 
of the Flower and Feather Manufacturers of America. 

A guest at the table where we sat, an army captain, 
suddenly wished the dinner might be reported as Rabelais 
would have done it. We wished so too, though it seemed 
a petition for the moon. If Rabelaisian eyes and ears were 
there, what could they do but sleep beneath so decorous 
a murmur of two hundred and fifty poets and friends of 
poets, all in standardized evening array? 

Readings and speeches, and more speeches: in which 
we were told that poetry in the last twenty years had 
become a practical traditional force in the life of America, 
that the Poetry Society of America was starting young 
poets on the right road, creating a more catholic art 
(" In fact anything now is poetry," one speaker permittqil 
himself to say), was breaking down the standardized 
patterns, giving the individual a show, making the country 
safe for poetry, turning out vital, valiant, normal, prac- 
tical poets; that the poets were too humble; that we live 
in a glorious age for poets; that they are a force for good 
against preachers, reformers, business men . . • etc., etc. 
In the course of which one was glad to meet refreshing 
honesty in the Nebraskan voice of Edwin Ford Piper, 
light skill in the humoresques of Wallace Irwin, flame in 
the rhymes of John V. A. Weaver. 

And in the five-hour program there were three numbers 
in higher relief, moments of waking for any Rabelais 
present — those of Chang Peng Chun, Amy Lowell, and 
Carl Sandburg. 

Early in the evening Chang Peng Chun brought a 
stillness into the room, a brief mood of contemplation. 
He wondered if American poetry today was just ^'a 
passing phase of trenchant curiosity, or the poetry of 
power, poignancy and mist." To the Chinese, he said, 
poetry meant something '* leisurely, unhurried, seriously 
seeking the depths, enjoying the feeling of pain-happi- 
ness." He thought of it as an art that might bring about 


Notes from the P, S. A. Annual 'Dinner 

in this country a new way of judging values — according 
to human satisfaction and not material gain; it might 
correct the evils of mechanization. He ended on an 
evidently bitter note — a hope that "China might be 
made a paradise for China, and not for pirates and 
profiteers." He gave these as classic definitions: 

Poetry is like the sound of the rhythm in the void; is like the color 
in phenomena; is like the moon in the water; the image in the mirror. 
There is an end in words, but the meaning will waft on forever. 

Two hours more of speakers, and Miss Lowell rose, and 
curdled some of the guests by the acid of her anathema 
against the trend of the evening. With the one Chinese 
exception, she damned it as a kind of benefit performance, 
"a phonograph repeating encores." She called for "the 
sharp clash of critical emotional insight;" but in vain 
that evening. 

At length at midnight Carl Sandburg did what seemed 
beyond doing — brought a maimed and dying audience 
to life again by magnets of the art which after all they 
must have come for. The room at last began to take 
on an air of enjoyment, extending even to the two sur- 
viving head-waiters in the wings. The definitions he 
submitted stood beside those fished from Chinese lore: 
poetry — "a mystic sensuous mathematics of fire, smoke- 
stacks, wafHes, pansies, people, and purple sunsets; a 
kinetic arrangement of static syllables; the capture of a 
picture, a song or a flair in a deliberate prism of words." 
The mathematics of a long deliberate supple poem, The 

Windy Cityy held his audience through its number of 
changing themes — a far blend, annealed in music, of 
movement, color, noise, mood, shape and fact; likely 
to baffle critics who label this poet as either "lyrical" 
or "rugged." Three songs to a guitar — one of them Jay 
GouU^s Daughter^ an ironic railroad caprice — perhaps 
lightened the intensity of this number, and perhaps deep- 
ened it. 

An hour of values contemplative and exciting, to four 
hours of futility ! An unfair ratio, it seemed to some of us.

IMPORTS FROM AFRICA 

To the Editor: Speaking of your Southern Number, 
have you seen the Imports from Africa contributed 
recently to The Reviewer^ of Richmond, Va., by Mrs. 
Julia M. Peterkin, who lives on an old plantation near 
Fort Motte, S. C. ? Here is one of these Negro carvings 
—it's called The Plat-eye: 

£f you trabble roun* at night, 'specially in de spring, endurin' de 
small o' de moon, you mor'n likely to see a plat-eye. Long up yonder 
by Gilliken's sto' at de ben' o' de road close by de two notch mile pos', 
a lil dog'll come a runnin' up by you an' kinder rub hisse'f up on you 
leg. You shoot at em, an' it'll tu'n to a hawg. You shoot 'em agin 
an' it'll tu'n to a boss. Shoot em agin, an' it'll tu'n to a man 'thout 
no head. But you keep on ashootin' an' it'll tu'n to a fog, jus' somep'n 
nother kinder like a cloud. Den you run. A cowardly man don' 
tote no break bones.

NOTES 

The May number of Poetry will be issued from a different address, 
232 East Erie Street. Our new office will be a few blocks north-east of 
the present one; being across North Michigan Avenue, and a quarter of 
a mile nearer Lake Michigan. 

We hope that our friends, new and old, will find us no less accessible 
and hospitable than we have endeavored to be in the abode which has 
sheltered us since Poethy began. "Flve-forty-three Cass Street" has 
become an important part of our history, and we hope that the bright 
south room in Erie Street will welcome as many guests and gather as 
many memories. 

Mr. DuBose Hey ward, of Charleston, who is secretary and one of the - 
founders of the Poetry Society of South Carolina, has been a contributor 
to Poetry and other magazines. Together with Mr. Hervey Allen, he 
will publish next autumn a book of local ballads and descriptive pieces, 
Carolina Chansons. 

Beatrice Ravenel (Mrs. Francis G.), of Charleston, S. C, is a well- 
known contributor to this magazine and others; a writer of stories as 
well as verse. 

Mr. Marx G. Sabel, of Jacksonville, Fla., also requires no introduc- 
tion to our readers. Nor does Miss Josephine Pinckney of Charleston, 
or Mr. Henry Bellamann, of Columbia, S. C, author of /f Music- 
Uacher*s Note-Book (N. Y. Poetry Book-shop). 

The other contributors appear for the first time in this magazine: 

Mr. Hervey Allen, of Charleston, is the author of Wampum and Old 
Goldy recently published by the Yale University Press in the YaU Series 
of Younger Poets. 

Mrs. Frances Dickenson Pinder, a member, like Mr. Sabel, of the 
Round Table group at Jacksonville, Fla., has contributed verse and 
prose to various magazines. 

May Thomas Milam (Mrs. J. C.)> of Atlanta, Ga.« has also contributed 
to the magazines. 

Elfrida De Renne Barrow (Mrs. Craig B.), a member of the Prosodists 
group in Savannah, Ga., has published little as yet. Ditto Miss Louise 
Jones, who was last year a student at the University of South Carolina 
in Columbia.

ALONG OLD TRAILS 

LOS LLANOS 

A GAIN, O plains, 
^^ I go your windswept ways. 
With Indian, trapper, trader, pioneer — 
Gray shadows all 
On gray grass. 

I am companioned — 
Miracle most strange — 
By youth 
And its high dreams. 

West, with the sun, 
From rim to rim; 
And then, 
Beyond ken, 

Tired miles of trails 
On sod fresh trod. 

So new 

The billows of your grass — 

So new 

Your breezes, born each morn. 

But old — so old — 
The ghosts that pass. 

HOPI SONG OF THE DESERT 

You are so beautiful ! — 

Like the face of Ta-wa-wis-ni-mi. 

I cannot speak the words 

To tell of your too-much beauty — 

You, the desert; 

You, the going down of the sun; 

You, my beloved. 

If I could hold you. 
If I could touch you! — 
But you flee from me. 
As runs the deer. 

You are so beautiful ! 

If only my song 

Could tell of your beauty!

YUCCA IS YELLOWING 



Yucca is yellowing — 

Hello, yellow! 

Cactus is crimsoning — 

Glow, glow, red fellow! 

And in the mesquite bush is seen 

A splash of green: 

As when sunset colors spill 

Their beauty down an evening hill. 

No one rides the trail today — 
Who cares if strange or lonely? 
No one goes the desert way — 
It is for beauty only. 



BAREBACK 

The winds ride bareback, 
Swinging lassos. 

Their reins hang loose. 
Their knees cling tight. 

The trees bend down . . . 
Behind, rides the rain. 

[6i] 




 

RAIN IN THE HILLS 

Were I the rain 
Coming over the hills — 

I should be glad 

That my cool fingers could ease the little fevers of dusty 

water-holes, 
And caress curled leaves of the cottonwoods. 

The herd. 

Pawing, bellowing, would let me quiet them. 

Standing in fresh pools by dusty water-holes — 

If I were the rain 
Coming over the hills. 

NAVAJO 

Your desert land is — 

An old squaw. 

Mumbling old words 

Beside dead embers of old thoughts. 

What she has told you 
Is not told to me. 
Though I ask. 



Your desert land is — 
Coyote, 




fFilliam H. Simpson 



Running alongside white horses 
As the wolves howl. 

What it has found out, running. 
Is not told to me, 
Though I ask. 



TEWA SONG 



Above the lands. 

Above the seas. 

You see, you know. 

All mysteries — 
Sun Old Man, 
Moon Old Man! 

Would I could fly 
On widespread wing 
Where whirlpools are 
And flame-tips sing — 
Sun Old Man, 
Moon Old Manl 

Die in the sea, 
And rise at mom; 
Thus would I go. 
And thus be born — 
Sun Old Man, 
Moon Old Man! 





DESERT NIGHT 



June moon of the desert, 

Sailing low — 
The ways are free 

Where God's fleets go. 

The palo verde 

You silver- tip; 
The mesquite leaves 

With your ghost-glow drip. 

Deep down in furrows 
Of wind-plowed hills 

You shine, and their glory 
Overspills. 



MAf^ANA 



Sf , sf, sefior, 

Should one ask, what for 

This slumbering 

When day is on the wing — 

There is roof overhead; 
On the table, bread; 
On the vine, 
Grapes for new wine; 
Burros two; 
And, querida miay you. 




fFilliam H. Simpson 



Tomorrow — 

Why trouble borrow? 

BURRO LOADS 

What do you carry, O burros gray, 
Heaped high with loads, at break of day? 

Pinyon for fires, when days are cold, 
And old men shiver, so cold, so old. 

Pinyon for fires, when coals are red. 
And brown-skinned bodies are blanketed. 

Pinyon for fires — like a crimson rose, 
Flaming, in camps by the early snows. 

Paisano, nifia, or sefior bold — 

Light for their souls, as bells are tolled. 

LANDSCAPE 

Quiet of November waters, 
White in the twilight— 

A narrow rippled ribbon, thrown carelessly by anybody, 
across faded fields. . . . 

Troubled March waters. 
Black in the noonshine — 

In curves, pushing against the late snows, tumbling them 
in.

TREES 

You root deep, 
And reach skyward. 

Something you say to me 
That is under the earth. 
Something you say to me 
That is over the earth. 

What it is, 

Perhaps the closed eyes know. 

What it is. 

Maybe the folded wings know. 

COUNTRY NIGHT 

Night, you have soft fur. 

And it is black; 

I hear you purr, purr. 

Night, you fly to my door, 

A tired raven 

From the world quarters four. 

(Is your nest in the hedge 

By the road. 

Or on the moon's edge?) 

Night, you are a sleepy girl — 
Arms around my neck. 
Your dark hair in a whirl. 


fFilliam H. Simpson 

INARTICULATE 



O dumbness of tree 
And of sod — 

You can say so little to me, 
So much to God! 



so LITTLE YOU ARE 



Earth! 

So little you are 
In the whirl of all worlds, 
Through the long cold 
And the long night. 

1 marvel 

That the tips of the sun-flames 

Find you 

Across wide ways of the dark. 

Or is it 

That life 

May come from its hiding? 

II 

O loved one. 

So little you are 

In the swirl of all souls. 

Through the long days. 

Through the long years! 

I wonder 

That the flames of my longing 

Find you 

Across wide ways of desire. 

Or is it 

That life 

May come from its hiding? 

DE NOCHE 

O mother of all the dark! 
Draw near, on tiptoe, 
Blindfold me, and say: 
Go to sleep — to sleep — to sleep. 

If only the hills of the night would stay in their steadfast 

places — 
Bulging bulk of the hulk of the range. 
They creep, like a she-panther, to where I rest in the 

valley; 
They come, down-tumbling, to where I lie on the pine 

boughs. . . . 

The river runs away. 

The aspens, by the runaway river, are afraid. 

THE TRAIL UP-SKY 

Too soon 

Fades that last whiteness of the moon. 


William H. Simpson 

The face of noon is wrinkled, old — 
Like Pablo's, of the sheepfold, 
Who has seen all youth go by 
On the long trail, up-sky. 

Evening waits 

At her turquoise gates 

To fondle us, 

And sing and sing. 

With croon of mothering. 

We ask not whither, 

Ask not why. 

On the long trail up-sky. 

CAMPO SANTO 

In6s, Anita, Tom&s, Jos6, 

I sup with you, on my pilgrim way; 

Craving the stillness of 'dobe walls, 
And earth-floors trod by soft footfalls. 

Yon campo santo is earthen, too; 
Room in it for me, and room for you; 

Little earth homes, for the weary — all 
Who seek their sleep by the earthy wall. 

William H, Simpson 


POETRY: A Magazhne of Verse 
ON THE ROAD 

PROMENADING 

As I went down to Baldwin's Pond, 

The mud-hens dove from sight, 
And then like corks bobbed bravely up 

And paddled with delight. 

Oh, green-blade rushes fringed the pool. 

Eye-lashes delicate; 
The waters were as calm as though 

A seer should gaze on fate. 

And reed-birds, piping holy notes, 

Inspired me with such faith 
That I walked on the shining pond 

As though I were a wraith. 

Yes, hand in hand with whitest flowers. 

My heart beat mad and high — 
I went a-walking (it was spring) 

With lilies on the sky. 

THE SCISSOR-GRINDER 

The scissor-man. tramped into town. Ding-a-dong! 

ding-a-dong! 
He set his little grindstone down, and to its music hummed 

a song. 


Carlyle Mclntyre 

Old Grandma Dumpkins' scissor-shears, he edged their 

blades so finely 
That she cut off her children's ears and made them sing 

divinely. 

And Gaffer Smither*s pruning-hook he whetted to such 

keenness 
That Gaffer trimmed the town, and took the shade away 

for meanness. 

But furthermore, the butcher's knife he rounded off so 

dully. 
That cattle now enjoy their life and fill the milkpails fully. 

Then — ding-a-dong! ding-a-dong! I saw his red hat top 

the hill; 
But all night long I heard his song played by his brother 

watermill, 

THE VISIT 

My latch was lifted — a tall light crept in. 

His wings were bleeding and his feet were sore. 

His eyes were vacant as a wind-swept moor: 

Most pitiful of glorious cherubim. 

I fed him, as I thought an angel must 

Be weary from a way so long and hard; 

I bathed his feet and balmed his wings with nard. 

Then sat before him, nibbling my poor crust. 

"Oh, are you Death?" I asked him.— "I am Faith." 
"Then shall I be exalted?" "Nay, brought low." 
"What shall I have" — for he had risen to go — 
"To prove I have not succored a fell wraith?" 
"You shall have doubt and bitterness," he said. 
And hence it is that I am worse than dead. 

Carlyle Mclntyre 



TWO POEMS 

I HAVE WAITED FOR YOU LONG 

I have waited for you long: the sun withdraws 
To covert under the hills; I am alone; 
No bell disturbs the evening monotone; 
I seem to merge with those implacable laws 
Which left the pyramid a graven pause 
In some gigantic attitude of stone. 
There is an advent I have never known, 
There is an imminence that overawes. 

Approach me, making pallor with your feet: 

I have waited for you long, my cold white one; 

Let not another muffled night repeat 

The tragic gesture of oblivion. 

Let all death be concentred in your tread . . . 

You will not walk with me when I am dead. 


Joseph Auslander 



LITTLE LOU 



To drink where the birds drink — 

Oh, the draught's touch is tender and cool ! 

Think— 

Scattered like soft buds over the brink 

Of this delicate pool 

The birds leave their kisses for you, 

Little Lou. 

To dream where the birds dream — 

Oh, the wind on the leaves is drowsily wild! 

Stream, 

Feathers of slumber in magical number 

Over our child. . . . 

The birds breathe their pale dreams on you. 

Little Lou. 

To die where the birds die — 

Oh, why is the woodland so hushed everywhere! 

And why 

Are all the leaves listless and limp in mid-air 

Beneath a dead sky! . . . 

The birds, they are dying for you. 

Little Lou. 

Joseph Auslander 



A PSALM FOR CATHLEEN NI HOOLIHAN 

I — one of the grey sands, cousin to him that was crucified. 
Who am come from the breast of Sheba to Caesar's 

poisoned wine 
Of which no Israelite may die — 
Have not forgot the tang of grey sands 
Nor the tang of keen black grasses. 
I, who have danced in Rome, 
And known Roman women of the dances, 
I have not strayed from my tribe 
Nor am I lost to my sires. 
For today I came to an island 
Green as my mother's song of Canaan, 
Fragrant as rain on the flax by the Nile, 
And I heard Cathleen Ni Hoolihan crying. 

She silenced her grief, and when I heard her speak 

Her breath was a breeze from a hill of blue flowers; 

And though there was no crown upon her 

I knew she was a queen; 

And though she raised a queenly cheek and shoulder 

I knew she was a slave. 

Tell me who you are^ intruder on my sorrow! 

I am one of the grey sands y cousin to him that was crucified y 
Who am come from the breast of Shebay majestic for all time; 
Whose cheeks y like meat of thefigy were violet and white. 
Andy Cathleen Ni Hoolihany I heard your crying. 


David Greenhood 

She hid her white face in the sorrow of her hair. 
That fell to the white petals of her feet. 

LIBERTY 

Wantonly I've been a freed man! 
In a weary, checked freedom; 

Far from the spinning in the pure blue of air, 
Out of the hymnal curve of worlds. 

And I wish I were caught by an orbit in tune 
With the choral serfdom of stars. 

Here, beneath the tree-tops even, I find 

Among meadowing sheep random more sure than mine — 

More sure than the frolic of pennies 
And the eddy of men in the streets. 

Hear, O Democracy: 

Unless I be captive to rhythm 

I am least free; 

Unless the rose can hold me meek. 

Or tiredness of dusk put me to sleep. 

Unless I be creature of the morning. 

Sheep of a shepherd, 

I am gone far astray in liberty — 
Homesick beyond song. 

David Greenhood 
IN WESTERN MOUNTAINS 



He stood a moment at the weathered edge 

Of the highest cliff, and looked far out with me 

Upon great valleys ending in the haze, 

And mountains that from haze drove up a wedge 

Of snow in skies of lapis-lazuli. 

Then something of the littleness of days 

His life could span came to him dizzily; 

And he, who boasted of his strength with men, 

Turned back and grasped a little cedar tree 

Near by, for safety; and he shut his eyes, 

Shaken, and would not turn to look again. . . . 

Back from that cliff-edge, jutting to the skies, 

He crawled, and spoke at last with heavy breath: 

"God, what a place! What is it? Life or Death?" 

II 

Our words seemed much in vain. . . . 
How many Ages helped those heights attain 
Such silence in the sun, 
O silent One? . . . 



Ill 



Faint jingle of little bells 
And the half-heard shuffle of feet, 


Glenn Ward Dresbach 

High up on the mountain side. 

Crept down through the waves of heat; 
And a gray thread wove through the wide 
Cloth of the mountain side. 

The burro train came down 

With ores men take apart 
As the thing they love the best 

From the multitudinous heart 
Of the mountain. But all I could see 
Was a gray thread through tapestry. 

Glenn Ward Dresbach 



QUESTION 

When I make ready to go to sea 

The prairie ways keep calling me; 

And when from the deep I'd be sailing home 

I am beckoned seaward by the breaking foam. 

Why need my heart be divided so — 

Going when I stay, and staying when I go? 

Flora Shufelt Rivola

ROUGH WAYS 

BURNT OUT 

I Started laying sod along the roof 

While the smoke thickened. Blown from tree to tree. 
The fire came on. . . . At last I dropped the spade, 

And bitterly 

I watched the timbers smolder and catch fire; 

Heard the flame chuckling at the work I'd done — 
A pleasant mouthful! Even now I can't 

Quite see the fun. 

BUZZARD 

All day the wind has sent along the trail 

A cry of battle. Now night falls again. 
Swept through the dusk like horsemen spectral-pale. 

The charging snow-gusts spur across the plain. 

Beneath their onslaught fades each wagon-mark. 

The winding road is captured. Mad to slay, 
They thunder down upon me in the dark; 

They strike me, blind me — I have lost the way! 

Kemper Hammond Broadus 




A PORTRAIT 

His eyes can be quite old and stern. 
But I have often watched them yearn 
Over an animal in pain; 
And I have seen him through the rain 
Carry young Iambs into the fold. 
If a September night turns cold 
He leaves his sleep, and in the gloom 
Covers the bushes that might bloom. 
I know that when his eyes grow dim 
The first young bud will shout to him; 
For in the spring I see him kneel 
Upon the rigid earth, and feel 
With gentle hands among the leaves. 
No glistening rim of frost deceives 
His instinct for arbutus flowers. 
He sings, during his working hours. 
In a young voice a rousing song. 
And sweeps the lagging work along. 
To the delighted earth he brings 
Abounding love of living things. 
So when he climbs the slopes to meet 
The rising sun, they kiss his feet! 

Mildred Weston 


CREEDS 



Men build rough high walls 
Along straight narrow lines 
And call them — Creeds. 

Men carve distorted shapes 
Upon the rough high walls 
And call them — ^Truth. 

Men put fantastic rags 
On those distorted shapes 
And call them — Beauty. 

Men keep, forever, 

Within those rough high walls 

And call it— Right. 

Men manacle their minds. 

Fearful lest they scale the rough high walls 

And be free. 

Men blind their eyes, 

Fearful lest they see the mysterious world 

And be wise. 

Men deafen their ears, 

Fearful lest they hear 

Enthralling music calling them beyond 

And go. 


John H. Gavin 

Men creep onward 

Between those rough high walls, 

Those grotesque walls, those queer-decked walls. 

And call themselves saved. 

II 

I am not saved, 
But, friend, weep not my lot; 
For I was born of sun and earth. 
And the stars are relatives of mine. 

I am brother to the wind. 
And the sea is a sister of mine. 

I am kinsman to the wolf. 

And the lamb is a cousin of mine. 

The blood of the eagle is part of me. 

Part of me is blood of the dove. 

The blood of the lark flows through my veins, 

And the venomous blood of the snake. 

My mother nestles the pine. 
The columbine, aster and rose. 

My mother fosters the oak. 
And the violet suckles her. 

My mother gives life to the palm. 
And the poppy grows red at her breast. 

[8i] 




 

Yes, and nothing trammels me — 
Save men, my most beloved fools! 

Men would deafen my ears, blinder my eyes, 
Manacle my mind! 

Ah, my kindred, I'll have no walls around me!- 
No rough high walls, no queer-decked walls. 

IMMORTALITY 

I am immortal as a burst of song. 
That quivers from the thrush's throat 
And sinks to silence. 

I am immortal as the kiss of love. 
That wakes the world to melody. 
And leaves a memory. 

I am immortal as the laughing hour. 

That throws her leaven on the sodden heart — 

And trips away. 

I am immortal as the purple dusk. 
That drugs the weary brain to dreams. 
And fades. 

I am immortal as the wind of March, 
That woos the barren earth to life — 
And passes. 


John H. Gavin 

I am immortal as the stubborn hills. 
That breast the storms of centuries. 
And wear to sand. 

I am immortal as the living sun. 
That flames a moment in eternity. 
And sputters out. 

John H. Gavin 



SILVER POG 

Hush — hush — hush! Steady as footsteps in the sand, 

I hear two other oars crunch in their locks — 

And look now, how my boat rocks 

To feel another boat dose by — 

So close, so close, that if I reach my hand . . . 

Who are you, who am I, 

To halt each other with a cry? 

Let us continue blurred and lonely. 
Touched by each other's trembling only. 
It is so seldom two can be 
Each for each a mystery. 

tFinifred JFelles 
A YEAR 



Before the snow had melted from north slopes 
John Mortimer could feel the coming spring. 
The imp that stirs the sleeping roots of trees, 
And sends the sap up to the highest twigs. 
Was in his blood. He envied the gaudy rooster 
Who from his throne upon the leaning gate 
Shouted his challenge through the morning air 
Across the sleeping fields where snowdrifts lay. 

One morning, going townward with the milk. 

He offered Mary Allindale a ride. 

Her father was a queer old man who worked 

A little farm, and sometimes played his fiddle 

Half the night after his work was done. 

She taught the village school. John never knew 

How pretty Mary was until that day. 

Dusky horizons, deep blue skies where clouds 

Float slowly, in the distance three black specks — 

They must be horses and a man plodding 

Along the boundary line between the gray 

Of last year's life and the black earth new-plowed. 

Resting upon a bed of last year's leaves. 

At noon John Mortimer could see tall ranks 


Raymond P. Fischer 

Of ripening corn; he dreamed of growing stock 
And bigger barns, and Mary Allindale. 

The evening wind blew sweet across the fields 

Of clover when at last he went to her. 

It brought them tell-tale odors of the farms 

They passed, the faint warm smell of growing corn, 

The cool and heavy incense of the stream 

That wanders half asleep through Watson's pasture. 

A whip-poor-will was crying in the birches 

By the bridge; the stars were tiny points 

Of gold above, and the road was dim and gray. 

John Mortimer said little, for it seemed 

That Mary Allindale belonged to him 

That night; the stars and mist-hung road were his, 

And awkwardly he took her in his arms. 

All the way home he heard her stifled laughter: 

He called himself a fool and vowed that he 

Would think no more of Mary Allindale. 



II 

The mower sang from dawn until the sun 
Was overhead; from noon hour until night. 
When hay was in he started on his barn. 
He liked the sound of hammers at the work. 
And liked to see the visioned barn take form. 

August came, and turned green fields to gold. 

Now binders moved across the sunny fields; 

Men followed them and left the grain in shocks. 

The threshers crawled along the country roads — 

Great Chinese dragons. Men brought them loads of grain 

To be devoured in a cloud of dust. 

When the barn was done his neighbors came in crowds, 
But Mary did not come. Shrill fiddles scraped. 
Feet stamped and shuffled; but he stood outside. 
So she preferred to him a good-for-nothing 
Fiddling fool who scarcely owned the clothes 
Upon his back. "They've gone out west to make 
A fortune; then they'll study music." The moon 
Came from behind a cloud and grinned at him. 
A screech-owl laughed from somewhere in the dark. 

Ill 

A steady thud and clump of horses* feet; 

A single crow seemed frozen in the sky — 

Borne on the cruel wind it drifted by. 

John Mortimer plowed on from dark to dark; 

He cut his fields in furrows for the frost 

And snow to smooth. But earth had lost its goodness — 

He did not care whether it shone or rained. 

The days when sun poured down like golden wine 

Did not deceive — ^he knew the world was wrong. 


Raymond P. Fischer 



IV 



The tiniest stream is hushed when winter comes. 
It cannot whisper to the passing banks 
About the great green ocean and its ships. 
The days when it has run before the wind 
Laughing and beckoning with hands of foam, 
The nights when tired of play it has crept up 
Some distant bay and murmured round the piling 
Of silent rocks, are all forgotten now. 

And winter hushed the whispering memories. 
He swung his ax all day and had no thoughts 
Except the quiet things about his work 
That come unsought to every worker's mind. 

One morning, going townward with the milk, 
He stopped to give the new schoolma'am a lift. 
Though he had often passed her on the road 
He had never known how beautiful she was. 
Though snow still lay in drifts on northern slopes. 
Though trees and roadside brush were white with frost, 
John Mortimer could feel the coming spring. 

Raymond P. Fischer 


COMMENT 



MOVING 



POETS and prosers have discussed in many volumes 
man's relation to his environment, but how much we 
are what surrounds us is still an open question. 

For nearly ten years Poetry has been at home in the 
not-over-spacious room to the left of the entrance of 
543 Cass Street. By the time this number is issued we 
shall have torn ourselves away from this cubic box of 
memories; we shall have shifted our furniture and files, 
our books and back numbers, our gallery of poets' photo- 
graphs and other pictures, our tempers and temperaments, 
our hearts and hopes and hospitalities, to a strange place 
as yet unenriched by history, leaving this atmospheric 
chamber, doubled in the big Victorian mirror over the 
mantel-piece, to the coldly calculating advances of the 
medical department of an insurance company. 

But we cannot depart without saying goodbye, without 
consecrating our farewell by recalling the things which 
have happened, the people who have entered or lingered, 
in this old haunted and haunting room. Once it was part 
of a dwelling which, erected soon after the Great Fire of 
Seventy-one, housed the family and the books of Ezra 
McCagg, owner of the largest private library in Chicago. 
For two or three decades the house stood among congenial 
neighbors — abodes of the quality, set in spacious grounds. 
But the quality, including the McCaggs, scattered, and 


Moving 

business penetrated — at first on tip-toe, hesitatingly. 
The American Bankers' Insurance Company bought the 
place and connected it in the rear with a new building, 
the two right-angling an apartment-house on the corner. 
And while their alterations were still fresh, in the summer 
of 191 2, the inexperienced prospective editor of a poets' 
magazine-to-be, entered the Ohio Street door one morning 
in search of a North Side ofBce in the neighborhood. 

Whom should she find in possession, as president of the 
insurance company, but one of the magazine's guarantors 
— Mr. James P. Whedon of happy memory, one of the 
most generous of all because his fortune was always 
moderate. Soon the editor and her first associate, Alice 
Corbin Henderson, were hospitably installed in one of the 
two rentable rooms beside the Cass Street entrance, their 
good friend adding office-desks and chairs to their meagre 
business equipment. From this room, during that 
summer of 191 2, the first letters and circulars went out in 
search of contributors and subscribers, and hither came 
those first responses on which depended the vitality of 
the magazine. 

Ezra Pound's first letter, for example — I have often 
recorded the cordiality of his co-operation as Poetry's 
first representative abroad. Along with him came through 
the mail the other first imagists — H. D. and Aldington, W. 
C. Williams and Flint and Cannfll. John G. Neihardt 
greeted us with a tragedy; Joseph Campbell with The 
Piper; Allen Upward with his Scented Leaves from a 

Chinese Jar; Joyce Kilmer — ^long before the brutal War 
which killed him — with Trees; John Reed — heroic beloved 
vagabond — with Sangar; Mrs. Conkling with her musical- 
minded Symphony in a Mexican Garden^ which, arriving 
in the nick of time for our first number, aided us in ante- 
dating a proposed Boston contemporary who had threat- 
ened to requisition our title. And so on — those important 
early contributors who enriched the magazine with their 
own values. 

The excitement of the adventure is what I remember 
best from that first experimental year. The novel enter- 
prise hovered, in the mind of the public, on the delicate 
border-line between the sublime and the ridiculous; and 
our own minds trembled between a thrill and a laugh. If 
pride was inflated by authoritative words from poets and 
critics, it soon collapsed under expert stabs of wrath or 
ridicule. If a few new and unknown poets aroused our 
hopes of genius, hundreds astounded us with self-satisfied 
mediocrity or worse. We were dashed between extremes, 
like a rubber ball in the play of a juggler; and the thing 
least expected was what happened next. 

Who led the long procession of distinguished visitors 
whose faces and words now haunt these walls? I think 
Rabindranath Tagore was the first of the then-unknown- 
but-now-famous bards who have actually darkened the 
Cass Street door and sat in our "poets' chair." Tagore, 
the sage of Bengal, whom we had thought of as in England 
or maybe India, but who wrote to us from Urbana, 


Moving 

Illinois, upon his first appearance in English in Poetry's 
third number — December, 191 2. And the second was 
Lindsay, who followed his General Booth to Cass Street 
that first winter, sealing his hardship with the hand of 
friendship. Witter Bynner and Arthur Ficke, the Damon 
and Pythias of the art, were among the early arrivals; 
and Agnes Lee Freer, a newly married resident of Chicago; 
and Helen Hoyt, who soon graduated from her com- 
mercial post into Poetry's office; and Maxwell Boden- 
heim, then mute and inglorious. 

And so on. The magic transformation of abstract 
name-carrying entities into living, breathing men and 
women, was then, as it continues to be, the editor's high 
reward. Poets, it became evident, were not mere voices 
far away, but human beings who could come into Cass 
Street and even develop into friends. During our second 
twelvemonth there were important miracles in this kind. 
Amy Lowell, pilgrimaging from Boston to Chicago with 
poems under her arm, seemed a prophet of change — was 
East coming West at last? was an era passing, and a 
new one on the way? As if to give answer, here came 
Carl Sandburg walking solidly into the office when the 
fateful year 1914 was new or perhaps unborn; entering 
with his strong hand out and his slow rich loyal voice 
uttering words of greeting. 

In the spring arrived two British poets from opposite 
curves of the world. The illustrious William Butler 
Yeats changed from a Poet Enshrined into a living 

Irishman who could give tit for tat to George Moore's 
imaginative gossip about him which had just appeared. 
In his honor Poetry "eased out" of Cass Street long 
enough to give a banquet which has since been recognized 
as a milestone in the path of the "new movement.'^ And 
along in April or May, one afternoon when the editor was 
alone, entered, on his way home from the South Seas, a 
handsome young Englishman then still obscure — one 
Rupert Brooke, a member of the "Georgian" group 
whose first anthology had but recently appeared. How 
peaceful was the day — how remote the possibility of war — 
to this blond young poet whose spirit was to "straighten 
like a flame" at the then-so-imminent bugle call, and run 
into the war-god's deadly arms with a song! 

Sara Teasdale, John Gould Fletcher, Edgar Lee 
Masters — these and many others, from Missouri, Arkan- 
sas, Chicago, the Seven Seas, were Cass Street guests of 
those early years. Later came Robert Frost and Wallace 
Stevens — opposite poles of the renaissance. The proces- 
sion goes on still — may it find its way into Erie Street — 
the procession of shadow-shapes assuming flesh and blood. 

Nor should we forget the others — the countless visitors 
who have arrived at our doors but never in our covers. 
They come with verses, mostly by mail but often in person; 
some modestly, some over-sure. They ask for criticism 
which, if granted, rarely satisfies the urge or ache within. 
They can not be classified — they are as varied as other 
growths of the living earth. Rich and poor, bourgeois 


Moving 

and bolshevik, refined and coarse, tragic and absurd — they 
have played their different parts in Cass Street, strangely 
unlike but moved always by the same motive: the longing 
to express themselves, to reveal their naked souls. 

If these walls could speak — these walls that we are 
leaving! They have heard everything discussed and torn 
to bits — men, women, poems, theories, tendencies, the 
war, the peace, marriage, divorce, clothes, coiffures, eye- 
brows, the abstract beauty and the ultimate defeat, life, 
death and immortality, the weather and the curve bf a 
dog's tail. And they have listened through hours of 
silence, with nothing ringing but the telephone, while the 
editor wrote, in old-fashioned long-hand, countless 
breathlessly-brief notes to poets; or summoned spirits 
from the vasty deep to infuse wit and wisdom into her 
editorials, and help her come to the end with a flourish — 
as now, when she must test Poetry's personality by 
shifting its environment, as she signs a final farewell to 
old Five-forty-three. H. M. 

REVIEWS 

A WOMAN WITH A HAMMER 

The Contemplative ^arry and The Man with a Hammer^ 
by Anna Wickham. Introduction by Louis Untermeyer. 
Hftcourt, Brace & Co. 

"The most casual reading — if such a thing were pos- 
sible — of Mrs. Wickham's work reveals the strength of 

her candor, the intense singleness of her purpose," writes 
Mr. Untermeyer in an introduction that makes one admire 
the shrewdness of the gentlemen who chose him for his 
task. And without wishing to disagree, the hesitant 
reader may be permitted to wonder what candor and a 
purpose may have to do with an art. In the present 
case, they seem to resolve themselves into pugnaciously 
put platitudes, like the following: 

Am I your mate because I share your bed? 

Go thenl Find each day a new mate outside your house. 

I am your mate if I can share your vision. 

Nor is one entirely ready to question the possible 
necessity of this explanation to the person addressed. It 
is simply that one, as a male in general, has a right to 
a sort of hypothetical intelligence; for a poet is, presum- 
ably, addressing the more illuminated of mankind. 

Nor, again, should a reviewer allow himself to be too 
greatly piqued by a technical insult to his sex; and the 
present reviewer does not purpose to be so. But even 
perspicuous generalities do not constitute poetry, and 
platitudes are not perspicuous; and a perusal of this sort 
of poetry in quantities enforces boredom. This poet, 
like too many others, becomes more interested in the 
reason for her unhappiness than in the unhappiness 
itself; and, having reasons that are commonplace enough, 
there is no subtle evasion in her statement, nothing to 
disguise, however thinly, the barrenness of trodden 
ground. 


A Woman with a Hammer 

When she essays a more lyric mode, she is equally 

stale, and her staleness is even more obvious to the 

average eye: 

With other thrift I turn the key 
Of the old chest of Memory, 
And in my spacious dreams unfold 
A flimsy stuff of green and gold, 
And walk and wander in the dress 
Of old delights and tenderness. 

In The Cherry Blossom Wand she achieves something 

of a literary grace, perhaps slightly more than that; and 

in Sehnsucht an epigram that is really very hard and well 

done; but otherwise there is little in the book to commend. 

I quote Sehnsucht: 

Because of body's hunger are we born. 
And by contriving hunger are we fed; 
Because of hunger is our work well done, 
And so are songs well sung, and things well said. 
Desire and longing are the whips of God — 
God save us all from death when we are fed. 

Mrs. Wickham's handling of sex-problems is too 
obvious, coming after Lawrence, for serious consideration; 
indeed, her handling of all topics, coming after someone 
or something else, is so. Nothing is so awkward to the 
mind of him addressed as a belated irony. 

"She is, in quick succession, burning hot and icy cold; she 
is driven from fiery antagonisms to smoldering apathy; 
she is acutely sensitive, restless, harassed," writes our 
commentator, approaching his climax; and most of us 
will leave him with the field. Yvor Winters 

WOODWINDS 

We^ the Musk Chasers^ by Loureine Aber. Ralph Fletcher 

Seymour. 

The most significant men of this poetic era have sur- 
rounded themselves, like the princess who slept for a 
hundred years, with brambles of objectivity, striving to 
insure inviolableness, man being resentful of intrusion. 
All the while the women have given themselves from day 
to day without reserve. There are rare exceptions, of 
course. But in the main it is the man who is on his 
guard, and the woman generous, in poetry and in life. 
So Loureine Aber has written without subterfuge; as 
though, like Marie BashkirtsefF, for her own journal. 
She speaks not alone of and for herself, but puts in order 
the chaotic protest and exaltation of numberless in- 
articulate girl-voices. There are in this age so many 
printed, and in a measure "successful" poets, that one 
forgets how many times that number of sensitive spirits 
are more silent than the dumb. For them it is not so 
simple a matter to net the flickering moth of emotion and 
mood and preserve it in adequate expression. Quite 
often the deterrent is laziness and a Nietzschean desire to 
exhale a god and a universe in one breath. Poetry, says 
the aspirant, with eyes "in a fine frenzy rolling," is a 
matter of inspiration and she grasps feverishly at vers libre^ 
perverting it into undigested prose divided arbitrarily 
into lines, unmindful of the euphonic devices by which it 
can be given beauty and charm. Loureine Aber has done 


Woodwinds 

her service not for these, but for the thousands of girls in 
cities, either born speechless or submerged in a bedlam of 
typewriters, adding machines, and switchboards. 

Miss Aber makes use not of a niggling rhythm of 
syllable for syllable, or a subtle rhythm of vowel, but of a 
large rhythm of word and phrase, so large in swing as to 
be almost Sandburgian. In it there is more than a trace 
of the influence of popular syncopation — 

Go so far, and halt your tracks. 

Catch the first glimpse, turn your backs. . . . 

Her work is done with commendable neatness and 
frugality. I have mentioned Sandburg in connection with 
rhythm; the resemblance goes deeper than that. But 
Loureine Aber has lopped off all extraneous material and 
presented herself in the kernel. Here are no polemics or 
propaganda. One is often tempted to do with poetry as 
a friend of mine does with the drama when she divides it 
into problem plays and good plays; or, to say with Yeats 
and emph^ize well the last word: "One makes of one's 
struggle with oneself poetry ; of one's struggle with others, 
rhetoric^ The self is not in the poet, as in elementary 
forms, a simple whole like the cipher. Rather in the 
higher organism it is a grouping of rebellious and often 
anarchistic parts; and in every such being the struggle is 
both common and unique. Moreover, this is an age of 
acute self-consciousness, as witness not only its verse but 
its novel, such as it is — the more diffuse form, therefore the 
fuller evidence. In order to be authentic one must have 


the keen observation and the frank speech of a surgeon. 

One has, however, the option of distilling one's speech into 

the essence of itself. This Miss Aber does not do. She 

is very simple, but gives glimpses, as in Old Man^ of an 

elemental strength that may be developed far: 

Dawn sprang wildly to her lips, 

And the little hard breasts burst as a waterfall over the rocks. 

I, the dark pine at the precipice neck, 

Lunged and was still; 

Then swiftly, as wild birds go to the kill. 

Toppled, and ran with her youth to the sea. 

They said I was wanton and cruel 

To have taken her youth at the height. 

To have matched the great might 

Of my years 

With her slender beauty and tremulous fears . . . 

I tell you, I lunged and was still, 
Then swiftly, as wild birds go to the kill, 
Toppled, and ran with her youth to the sea . . . 
Pity mel 

Though one may disagree with the poet on "beautiful 

hills" as a necessary adjunct to the concept of God, God 

in the City is as strong an indictment against those who 

"wrought pigsties out of gauze" as though it were legally 

drawn up, witnessed, signed, and sealed. It is a universal 

confession: 

Beautiful hills. 

Valleys ... 

And all the other things we think of when we think of God, 

Are not here. 

I find myself at a loss to formulate much good, 

And so I simply say "God!'* 


Woodwinds 

Asyoucair'Fido!" 
And let it go at that. 

If Miss Aber has not yet reached her poetic majority, 
she is at any rate among the few one would have bring 
their gifts to perfect fruition through a study of the 
masters, new and old, and through the sacrifice of ease. 

I should like also to add an appreciative word to Mr. 
Seymour for the format of this book, and to Mr. Blackwell 
for his delicate decorations. Pearl Andehon 

QUAKER-GRAY AND ROSE 

Willow Pollen^ by Jeannette Marks. Four Seas Co. 

In this first book of verse, with its non-committal cover 
of quaker-gray, I like best the poems in which Miss 
Marks' clear, sharp and often whimsical mind is in the 
ascendency over her emotions. 

In some spirits pain is a flame that flares and consumes 
till the burning consciousness lights up all around it; in 
others, a smouldering ache that, however it be heaped 
with green withes, throws up a screening smoke. In the 
groping cries of some of thpse songs of pain I feel a lonely 
and proud spirit that has been hurt much, but the hurt 
has blurred instead of sharpening expression. 

The cleavage between Miss Marks' mental and emo- 
tional approach gives a curious effect of duality of per- 
sonality. Sometimes it seems as though the verses must 
have been written by two esthetically dissimilar person- 
alities. On one page you will find the innocent sentimen- 

tality of a piece of album verse, and on the other such 
acidly lovely lines as these from White Hair: 

All the warmth has gone out of white hair; 
It only answers to the wind, 
And lifts and stirs like creeping snow 
Close to the frozen scalp of earth. 

This disparity can no doubt be partly explained by the 
inclusion of early poems, but it is surprising to find such 
pallid stuff as Your Sunlit Way between the same covers 
as a sharply-faceted poem like Stars^ with its molded form 
and finely pointed thought. 

Often you feel how this southern woman loves the sun. 
In Calendar^ where the tender, intimately whimsical 
gossip about nature recalls Emily Dickinson, the sun is 
likened to "a bee, a big bee, a burning bee." 

Throughout the book are scattered delightful whimsi- 
calities, and stanzas from which luminous images leap 
like sudden lights out of a mist. Sometimes with an 
unexpected line Miss Marks can push out the walls of a 
narrow room into an unlimited horizon. Take the rose- 
gray magic of this conjured picture: 

Sea gulls I saw lifting the dawn with rosy feet. 

In Jeannette Marks' more intense moods — Sea GullSy 
from which the above lines are taken, Dragon and others 
— there is a note of hysteria, a desperate, half-fascinated 
peering into the depths where 

myriad eyes 
. . . float and sway, stab, sting and die away.

Quaker-gray and Rose 

You feel the terror and curiosity of a romantic imagi- 
nation that is drawn by the sinister-grotesque into the 
darker ways of fantasy. But always in this nature the 
romanticist is in eternal conflict with the moralist — no 
mind-made moralist at that, but one into whose quivering 
soul is bitten, as with an acid, a sense of inescapable 
responsibility for others' woes. 

For me the charm of fVillow Pollen lies in those verses 
where the poet's heart is quiescent, and the alert and 
supple mind is free to play delicately, as in Cloud: 

Tut, it is a ship as plain as anything. 

Full-spread to find the silver edges of the world 

Where ships and island daffodils 

Bum, follow sun, dip, 

Cling to the shining brim like flapping butterflies . . . 

And the "sky" . . . 

Now you tell what the sky is! 

In the last two lines you touch a certain elfin quality 
in Miss Marks' mind, a quality that is emphasized in the 
delicious sleep song. Rose Toada: 

Shoo, Rose Toada, Shoo! 
Jewelled red eyes for you. 
Shoo, Rose Toada, Shoo! 

Hoosh, Rose Toada, hoosh! 
Litde green snake in the bush. 
Hoosh, Rose Toada, hoosh! 

Bizz, Rose Toada, buzz! 
Gold on its wings and fuzz. 
Bizz, Rose Toada, -buzz!

VICARIOUS EXPERIENCE 

Clouds and CobblestoneSy by Hortense Flexner. Houghton 

Mifflin Co. 

Though Miss Flexner's poetry builds up the picture of 
an attractive and cultivated personality, and though her 
verse is always polished and sometimes sparkling, it is 
never heart- wringing. It has not, one imagines, wrung 
the heart of the poet. We find her deeply moved by a 
number of things — a newspaper account of a pogrom, a 
child's death in a charity ward, the futility of war. Her 
sympathetic scope is wide: she sees, with a pitiful vision 
devoid of mockery, the tragedy of approaching age in 
the life of a rich and shallow woman; she has a wistful 
comprehension of a child's day-dreams. But all this is, 
after all, vicarious experience. One misses the swirl and 
rush of unimpeded personal emotion. 

We find also a generous sprinkling of "poetic" themes 
and words — Helen and asphodel — with an occasional 
charming vers de societi^ of which we may instance For an 
Old Lady to whom Sonnets had been Written; and less often, 
such a skilfully wrought interpretation as The Death 
Mask of an Unknown Soldier, For the rest, we learn that 
the poet loves April blossoms, the colors green and gray, 
the little child next-door — facts agreeably but not mem- 
orably recorded. Some of the love-lyrics have fragrance 
and charm, but none of them seems deeply motivated. 
There is hardly a poem in the book that seems to have 
sprung into being because of an irresistible inner urge, 


Vicarious Experience 

Too frequently these poems are weighted down, ver- 
bose: Miss Flexner uses words unsparingly, a defect not 
excused even by the intrinsic and evocative beauty of 
many of her favorite words. This criticism does not hold 
true of her free verse, however — clever, frequently 
humorous flashes from an active mind, which serve to 
counterbalance the easy sentimentality of the lyrics. 

As a proof that the volume contains much that is lovely, 
it is only fair to let the poet speak for herself, as she does 
very characteristically in Four Things: 

Four things I cannot remember 

In the fulness of their grace, 

Wind of the spring, curve of the sea. 

The moon's pale touch on a white birch-tree. 

And your kiss upon my face. 

For though I cherish and hold them. 
The heavy winter through, 
Spring is more gay, the sea foam-wrought 
And the birch, are lovelier than I thought; 
And a kiss is always new.

JEAN COCTEAU 

Poesies — igiy'ig20y and Carte BlanchCy by Jean Cocteau. 

Editions de la Sir^ne, Paris. 

M. Cocteau has been described as the "enfant prodige" 
of contemporary French literature. As to whether this 
description conveys the whole truth about him or only 
a part, opinions will necessarily differ. His latest book 
of poems reveals both his weaknesses and his strength. 

Whatever else may be said about them, the fact remains 
that here is the expression of a very definite personality 
reacting to an extraordinary degree to visual and tangible 
stimuli, and endowed with both imagination and fantasy. 

Indeed, so vivid are the impressions this poet receives, 
and so contemptuous is he of the ordinary rules govern- 
ing the use of language, that in the attempt to fuse the 
one with the other the result is frequently baffling, even 
to the most intelligent reader, and must be often com- 
pletely incomprehensible to the majority. This must be 
counted a fault, if clarity and universal intelligibility 
are reckoned as characteristics of the greatest art — and 
most people take this view. Similarly, contempt or 
neglect of form can be pushed to extreme limits^ and this 
is a reproach to which M. Cocteau evidently lays himself 
open. But once these points have been conceded to 
the — not necessarily carping — critic, it must be admitted 
that the poems themselves merit serious attention, even 
if they fail to arouse universal admiration. 

We are conscious that the poet is, as it were, walking 
on a tight-rope all the time; or at least on some level to 
which the ordinary reader is, to say the least, unac- 
customed. To vary the metaphor, we might compare 
him to an excessively agile mountain goat who will soon 
be lost sight of by his pursuer unless the latter in his 
turn manages to reproduce, with tolerable exactitude, 
each perilous leap from peak to peak so earelessly under- 
taken by the quarry he pursues. Indeed, unless the 


Jean Cocteau 

reader possesses the power not only of making mental 
leaps, but of making the same mental leaps as the author 
of these PoisieSy fee will often find himself hopelessly 
left behind and floundering in valleys of apparent non- 
sense. 

This poetry is elusive in the extreme, obeying, it might 
almost be said, no rules but those of the author's imagi- 
native caprices. M. Cocteau reminds one at times of 
Humpty Dumpty in his treatment of words. "When 
I use a word," Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful 
tone, "it means just what I choose it to mean — neither 
more nor less." "The question is," said Alice, "whether 
you can make words mean diflferent things." "The 
question is," saidHumpty Dumpty," which is to be master 
—that's all." 

But none of this is said in condemnation. Certain 
means are proper to certain ends, and the ultimate test 
of a poem, as of anything else, is whether it achieves the 
effect intended. And it must at once be conceded that 
M. Cocteau 's poems do this in nine cases out of ten. 
Take, for example, Ascenseur (of course unpunctuated) : 

Tant de douceur 
dans notre moelle 
c'est un masseur 
graiss6 d'6toiles 
Gabriel artificiel 
en tombant du ciel 
freine un peu 

On m'a parl6 d'un ascenseur extraordinaire i New York 

il donne le baiser du vacuum cleaner 

et on vous retire en bas comme une loque 

Petite cabine vernie 
abominable douceur 

.La mort fauche avec son aile 
tous les Melons de T^chelle 

une 6bauche 
d'agonie 

Le m&t de hune 
huil6 de lune 

on touche le bouton i gauche 
4 Tangle de la vitrine 

La lune douche Testomac 
ouvre la bouche 

ut de poitrine 

Here we have, in a few lines, all the physical and psy- 
chological sensations connected with our experiences 
of lifts; and the whole poem is on a definitely imaginative 
level. 

Le Voyage en Italie is another good example of M. 
Cocteau's style, and while it is far too long for quotation, 
it is rich in happy phraseology and striking images, such 
as: 

Rome Le pape a enferm8 tout le monde dehors 

Shelley a toujours eu Tair 
d'une grande fille noy^e 

Naples A Paris ce soir 

il fait un temps de concierges dehors 

[io6] 



 



Jean Cocteau 

While the nostalgia of this most Parisian of Parisians 

amongst the monuments of Rome and the ^^ plafonds 

lourds'' is eloquently voiced in the following poignant 

lines: 

J'ai besoin de Paris et des Champs Elys6es 

j*ai besoin de Paris je ne suis pas de Rome 

je ne suis pas de Moscou Marie 

rue d'Anjou douceur ang^vine 

pauvre Marie j'ai mal i mes Champs £lys6es. 

In Batterie the poet reveals another side of himself — 
his love of the sun and of the contrast between the black 
skins of negroes and the azure skies under which they 
live and toil. This note is of frequent occurrence, but 
nowhere is it more eloquently expressed than in this 
hymn to the sun, which is one of the most formal of the 
poems in this volume: 

Soleil je t'adore comme les sauvages 
k plat ventre sur le rivage 

Soleil tu vernis tes chromos 
tes paniers de fruit, tes animaux 

Fais-moi le corps tann6, sal6 
fais mon grand douleur s'en aller 



Fais braire la cigale en haut du pin 
fais-moi sentir le four i pain. 



Fais-moi r6pandre mes mauvais r^ves 
soleil, boa d'Adam et d'Eve! 

Fais-moi un peu m'habituer 

i ce que mon pauvre Jean soit tu6. 


POETRY: A. Magazine of Verse 

The poem is too long to quote in its entirety, but it is 
one of the most striking in the collection — a collection 
redolent of the exoticism of ships and ports, American 
bars and sky-scrapers, negroes, films, ice-cream sodas 
and the melancholy of swings and roundabouts — the 
whole seen through the eyes and filtered through the 
sensibility of a highly cultured, versatile, imaginative, 
curious and extremely modern mind. 

Carte Blanche is a reprint of a series of articles which 
appeared in Paris Midi during the summer of 191 9. 
They treat of a variety of subjects, ranging from a dis- 
cussion of the latest movements in French music and 
painting to essays in sheer reporting, such as the descrip- 
tion of the Difili de la Victoire^ at the peace celebrations 
on July fourteenth, 191 9. They furnish another example 
of the versatility of M. Cocteau and of the never-failing 
lightness of his touch and the quickness of his compre- 
hension. The paper devoted to Landru is full of good 
things, and a model of this kind of topical essay. 

Landru inaugure le retour da Fait-Divers civil. Avec lui le chien 
6cras6 retrouve ses droits. . . . L'amoureux mediocre brflle des sou- 
venirs. . . . n'est-il pas plus simple de bri^ler toute la dameP ... Si 
Landru se livrait i cette liquidation, j'aime Timaginer au coin du feu, 
dsonnant les cendres de sa belle d'un air rdveur et soupirant: "Du 
courage — il ne faut plus penser i tout cela." 

Perhaps some readers will prefer M. Cocteau's prose 
to his verse: enough has perhaps been quoted to reveal 
the quality of both. Rollo H. Myers 


OUR CONTEMPORARIES 

MORE NEW MAGAZINES 

If new magazines may be assumed to indicate a certain 
vitality in the art they represent, modern poetry may be 
congratulated; for its voices are speaking everywhere, in 
organs from leaflet to folio size. Some of these organs 
are for poets only, but most of them admit him with 
writers of tales, critics, sometimes limners and composers. 

Here is The Beacon^ published in Oxford, England, by 
B. H. Blackwell, who has given so many young English 
poets their first appearance in small volumes beautifully 
made. The Beacon "aims to deal broadly and construc- 
tively with three essential and inseparable things — Educa- 
tion, Religion and Art." The first number, introduced by 
a poem by Tagore, and A Credo for a New Era by Stephen 
Graham, contains interesting articles and drawings, but 
little in our special province. 

Broom, our international Roman contemporary which 
is now in its fifth number, has lost Alfred Kreymborg 
from its staff. Harold A. Loeb now conducts it in Rome, 
and Lola Ridge has recently become its American editor, 
her office being at 3 East Ninth Street, New York. 

Another international monthly began in Barcelona, 
Spain, last February. Prisma proclaims itself ''una 
revista intemacional de poesia,* and enriches its first 
number with Opflfer's portrait of Carl Sandburg, an article 
on the latter by Louis Butcher Lee, and translations of 

nine of his shorter poems, including Jan Kubelik and 
Cool Tombs. Indeed, Spain has been sending us a number 
of magazines of late. Two from Madrid are La Plumay 
now in its third year, and the first three numbers of 
Indice (Revista Mensual). 

And another impending international is Secession^ 
which, "instigated at Paris, opens fire this spring at 
Vienna, will march on Berlin, and eventually establish 
itself in New York. ... It will, in its early numbers, 
expose the private correspondence, hidden sins, and 
secret history of its American contemporaries — The Dial^ 
Little RevieWy Broomy Poetry, etc." 

From the far antipodes comes The Australian Poetry 
Annual of ig22y published by the Melbourne Literary 
Club, and presenting poems sometimes creditable, but 
not yet exciting or suggestive of the locale. 

Youthy the Chicago monthly which we welcomed last 
autumn, must have been beloved of the gods, as it died 
with a promptness befitting its title. To The fFavey also 
published by Steen Hinrichson, we may wish a longer 
and more prosperous life. Its editor is Vincent Starrett, 
and it contains poems and prose by a number of our 
friends; also, in the second number, a group of beautiful 
wood-cuts by Birger Sandzen. 

The RevieweTy of Richmond, Virginia, now in its second 
volume, is discovering some interesting material in the 
South. We quoted last month one of Mrs. Peterkin's bits 
of Negro folk-lore.

^ ^ More New Magazines 

From here and there come tiny leaflets of local verse 
— for instance, The Bardy from Dallas, Texas; and The 
Poet's Scroll from Sherwood, Oklahoma. No strong 
evidence of genius in these, but they represent each a 
group and an aspiration. 



CORRESPONDENCE 

FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE P. S. A. 

To the Editor: Please let me say a word as to your 
correspondent's report of the P. S. A. annual dinner. 

She begins with an interested reference to other dinners 
— banquets of Shoe-lace and Ribbon Manufacturers, 
Flower and Feather Manufacturers — which may have 
been held that evening at the Hotel Astor and which 
might have appealed to the avowed Rabelaisian taste of 
your reporter more than did the dinner which she attended. 
The poets were "decorous", she complains, they were 
"all in standardized evening array." So, as far as I 
could observe, in spite of her having written verse, was 
your reporter. 

She follows with a saucily lackadaisical account of the 
program, some of it accurate. The gist of the remarks 
that bored her was very much akin to the gist of the 
leading editorial in the April Poetry: "Local loyalties 
are turning with deep enthusiasm toward the arts." 
She would evidently prefer a clever monopoly — ^perhaps 

[III] 




 

in Chicago. She missed the deliberate intimation of the 
evening. Some of us realize that New York is quite 
as provincial as Chicago; and the Executive Committee 
deferred at the January dinner, all along the line, to 
speakers from the other provinces. 

She instances with relish Miss Lowell's challenge to 
the Society. Miss Lowell, a critic who has quaintly 
and ably won for herself the right to be blunt, assumed 
an absence of "sharp clash" and "critical emotional 
insight" from the Society's meetings and announced her 
preference, as one often does, for her own judgments and 
methods of expression. Miss Lowell was largely wrong 
in her assumption. Her "clash", this time, was rather 
flat than sharp, for the reason that she was recklessly 
judging, by meetings of other poetry groups, the regular 
sessions of the P. S. A., where there has certainly been 
more "sharp clash" than at any smaller contemporary 
gatherings of poets anywhere, whether public or private. 
As to "critical emotional insight", it is easier to talk 
about than to exhibit, especially at a dinner. 

Miss Dudley concedes "an hour of values contempla- 
tive and exciting." That seems to me a fair ratio in a 
professional program. She complains of "four hours 
of futility." During two of those hours, she and the 
"army captain" she mentions were free to contribute 
at their own table whatever they desired of Rabelaisian 
stimulus and general interest. If they chose to contribute 
"futility", it was their own fault. 


From the President of the P. S. A. 

Large dinners, whether social or professional, are not 
ideal means of intellectual or emotional exchange. In 
lieu of something better, they have become an occasional 
method of assemblage for the membership of organiza- 
tions. The P. S. A., in addition to its monthly meetings 
of give and take, chooses to listen quietly once a year 
to some group or other of members and guests. This 
year all the speakers, except Mn Chang Peng Chun, 
were Americans, from widely different parts of the country. 
There were no expatriates even. Only one of them had 
been heard before by the Society. Some of them may 
have been dull. So were some of their critics. But 
none of the speakers, if you will forgive me, made the 
lapse of mistaking mere smart distemper for "critical 
emotional insight." 

That sort of lapse, if you will forgive me again, is becom- 
ing too frequent in the pages of Poetry. Miss Dudley is 
not the only offender. Are there no stages, dear editor, 
between the stodgy and the supercilious? Are there 
no happier ways of avoiding one kind of emptiness than 
by substituting another? Is sharp crash valuable to you? 
Must a crackling of thorns boil the pot and the poet? 
Is even prose less important than pose? Should a 
magazine which has shown signs of health permit itself 
these amusing but unlovely sounds of literary indigestion? 

Incidentally let me thank you for printing in a recent 
issue an honest and thoughtful article by Mr. Baker 
Brownell. Witter Bynner 



A WORD FOR MR. GUEST 



To the Editor: I suppose you will hardly care to print a 
brief protest against your condemnation of Mr. Guest. 
Let me say at once that I entirely agree with you that 
his verses are not poetry, perhaps not even literature, 
in your and my sense of the term. Neither is the bulk 
of Longfellow. Yet both Longfellow and Mr. Guest 
touch the human heart in a fashion quite out of the 
reach of most of the estimable writers who monthly 
adorn your pages. Mr. Guest's trivial little poems impart 
something — perhaps not much, but something — of the 
sweet high consecration of rhythmic ecstasy to the 
common things that make up the daily experience of 
millions of readers who would be quite insensible to 
Ezra Pound and Amy Lowell. Also, I think you vastly 
over-estimate the importance of Mr. Guest's reward. 
It is precisely proportioned to his production: dull, sordid 
dollars, and the loud vociferation of the thick-breathed 
vulgar which your finer-natured poets would instinctively 
disdain. And I disagree totally with your view that Mr. 
Guest is a menace to literature. On the contrary, I do 
not believe that his verses distract one single reader from 
a better order of poetry, while they may lure many 
readers, through the medium of his rather obvious music, 
to something much more worth while. Surely you do not 
imagine that, if Mr. Guest were altogether eliminated 
from a world of which I esteem him a considerable bene- 
factor, the circulation of Poetry would be increased by 


A Word for Mr. Guest 

a single subscriber. Those who read Guest will never 
read Sandburg, and those who read Sandburg will never 
read Guest. Why not let each reader have what appeals 
to him and helps him ? Gamaliel Bradford 

NOTES 

The initial Blindman Prize of J250 has been awarded by the Poetry 
Society of South Carolina to Grace Hazard G)nkling, for Variations on 
a Themey which was named by Miss Lowell^ the appointed judge, as 
the best of many poems submitted in a contest open to all poets 
writing in English. 

Mr. William H. Simpson, of Chicago, who has appeared in Poetry 
before, has been for years in the service of the Santa Fe railroad, of 
which he is advertising manager. Extensive travels on and from this 
road have interested him in our south-western wonderland and its 
aboriginal life. Mr. Simpson used to write verses in his youth, and 
of late he has resumed the art more seriously. 

Mr. Carlyle Mclntyre, of Los Angeles, has also appeared in Poetry, 
but has not yet published a volume. A book, published some years 
ago by a poet of almost identical name, is not his. 

Mr. Glenn Ward Dresbach, of El Paso, Texas, will soon issue his third 
book, In Colors oj the West (Henry Holt & Co.). 

Mr. David Greenhood, now a resident of San Bernardino, Cal., 
was a member of Witter Bynner's poetry class at the University of 
California a few years ago. 

Flora Shufelt Rivola (Mrs. Charles) of Yankton, S. D., is another 
familiar contributor. 

The other poets of this month appear here for the first time. 

Mr. Raymond P. Fischer, formerly of Chicago, is now in Upland, Cal. 

Winifred Welles (Mrs. H. H. Shearer), of New York, is the author 
of The Hesitant Hearty published last year by B. W. Huebsch. 

Mr. Joseph Auslander, born in Philadelphia of Spanish and Russian 
parentage, and a graduate of Harvard, is now studying at Oxford, 
England. His poems have appeared in various magazines. 

Mr. Kemper Hammond Broadus is the young son of Edmund Kemper 
Broadus, of the faculty of the University of Manitoba in Alberta, who 
appeared in early numbers of Poetry, and who has just published a 
book on the Poets Laureate of England. 

Mr. John H. Gavin lives in Chicago, Miss Mildred Weston in Pitts- 
burgh, Pa.

For a verse-writer to be printed in POETRY is about the 

most honorable of recognitions. 

Ford Madox Hueffer in the New York 
Evening Post Literary Review: 

This monthly pubh'cation is an exhibition of literary faith 
and bravery that belong to the heroic age. 

The Daily Journal, East St. Louis. 

The varied interest and beauty presented are typical of 
POETRY'S quality. Thanks to a rare coincidence of 
poise and generous imagination, of sense and sensitiveness, 
it ranks easily as the best vehicle of poetry in the English 
language. 

From an editorial in the New York Sunday Tribune. 

POETRY has become a significant force 
in the intellectual life of America. That 
astute observer, the late William Marion 
Reedy, wrote: *Trobably Miss Monroe has 
done more for the high art of song than any 
other person in the United States" — a state- 
ment which has been generously supported 
by other commentators of similar prestige.

CONVERSATION 



SUPPOSE," he thought, " there are invisible beings, 
fairies, elves; 
Suppose rheumatism is nothing but Robin-pinches; 
Suppose a wind is only the beating of fairy wings 
And fairy fingers dofiing your hat to invisible majesties." 

He sat on the bench motionless. 

The dust sifted upon him, 

Leaves caught upon his clothing, 

Vagrant sheets of paper wrapped about his feet. 

"Chance is decent and does not leave the silent things 

exposed. 
She covers the stone with moss, and spreads 
A coverlet of mold upon the unmoving things. 

"Suppose I stayed here a year? 

Would the elves come and cover me with leaf drift, and 

dust 
Carefully shaken over me? 
Would they sow seeds under my feet? 
Would the moss grow from the clay on the soles of my 

shoe? 
Would I be wound in spider-webs?" 

II 

Another one sat down beside him 

And cut his world in two. 

He moved back as if to drag back the severed half. 

But the other one held it tenaciously. 

His very shadow was a seal of possession, ineffaceable. 

For a moment they sat still, taut. 

Like two who tug at a rope. . 

"Pleasant day?" 

"Pleasant day!" 

And so they fused their world with sticky speech. 

" I was wondering how it would be 

To be a year in one place — 

For the rain to soften you, and the wind to mold you. 

And the dust to fill in your cracks." 

"You would be a tree then: 

["8] 



 



Isidor Schneider 

Your toes would drip into roots; 

Your arms would be long brown branches 

Holding leaves like cups to fill with sunlight and dew." 

"If I were silent 

The ininsible realms would open about me; 

The unseen people would buUd a road between my feet — 

They would build a city in the shadow of my knees. 

Like cities built below mountains. 

I might be their sphinx, satiate with questions." 

"There is no invisible world 

Except the worlds you do not see. 

These can be reached by travel. 

Your stillness will not be inviolate — 

All things using life will apportion you 

With shrewd husbandry: 

The birds will inherit your head and your shoulders; 

Hungry things will hot spare you; 

Insects and beasts will dispute your flesh, 

And bound your body for dwelling-places." 

"There is no need of travel — 

Stillness will invite these other worlds 

That are delayed by distance. 

The wind will plant about my feet 

Their final flowers; 

The rivers will wash their soil under my roots; 

The travel-urge will throw 

Their curious sampled people out to me. 
The other worlds I mean are mixed with this — 
They course within our life 
Like floods within the ocean." 

" I do not think these things — 

They walk like strangers out beyond my mind; 

Only of this world, which I see suddenly 

Like clouds disclosed by lightnings. 

Love came to me suddenly; 

Hatred armed my hands once, 

And I knew remorse. 

Hunger and a red wound 

Taught me the thin texture of life." 

"They say the sky is distance only. 

And the color of distance is blue. 

And that is why violets, who have the distance of fragility. 

Are blue. 

Since there are larger worlds around us 

There must be smaller other-worlds within us. 

If one could find them." 

"We who are within the waiting-rooms of existence 

Should not peer into the deeper halls. 

Nor tempt the attendants with our lauding curiosity." 

"Can you not watch how the ceilings and the walls 

Mark the backs of other rooms? 

Can you not let your mind tentatively therein?" 


Isidor Schneider 

"No — I would still suspect it." 

"Well—?" 

"Well— ni be going; good-day?" 

"Good day!" 

And one man walked away, brushing from ^im crawling 

words; 
While the other sat still, 
Wiping from his world 
The stains of conversation. 



THE MIST 

Is death a mist 

In which life becomes invisible? 

Yesterday 

The world ended in mist. 

It lay shrunken by immobility 

Into a gray cofEn. 

The steeple rose. 

Prodded and pricked the mist 

Like a question 

Investigating doubt. 

Its dim spire 

[I2lj 




 

Found the horizon new arranged 

In stories. 

The world became strange, 

Ungrateful 

Of the jagged lights 

That seamed its veils. 

To me, walking. 

The long road unravelled 

A guiding string; 

And my eyes 

Carried before and behind 

Its constant small visibility. 

I faced the mist-made microcosm — 

Where pebbles are boulders, 

Puddles lakes, 

Sidewalk-cracks long chasms. 

The curb a precipice; 

Where towers flew. 

Roofs floated like rafts; 

And smoke wreaths 

Were like dark veins 

Under a skin. 

Is death a mist 

In which life becomes invisible? 

Isidor Schneider 

[122 J 



 



A MOOD 

I am sad for the beauty that is dead: 

For the sunset that I saw tonight 

As I walked on a hill. 

For the tangle of clouds in the light 

Where the rim of the sun was showing still. 

For the breath of a lily slim and pale 
That I brought from the forest yesterday. 
For the song of a lark on an old fence rail; 
For a ground-wren's nest in the last year's hay. 

For three slim dogwoods on a mountain-side. 
Like ghost trees whitely nodding at the grass; 
For a field of buttercups upon a river bank — 
For a jaybird jeering shrilly as we pass. 

For a wild rose by an alder tree — 
For a ginger bloom more fragrant than the rose. 
For a swallow sailing by with sapphire wings 
Where a waterlily in the shallows grows. 

For all the things that are passing and are fair; 
For the shortness of the hour that gave them birth. 
For the paucity of human hearts that care; 
For all the things that are only of the earth. 

I am sad for the beauty that is dead. 

Joseph Andrew Galahad 

NIGHT ABOVE THE TREE LINE 

You berries^ that are full of the dark dusks 
Of mountains and the moisture of chill dews. 
Swell on your stems and break your ripened husks 
For lips which it would wither you to lose — 
If there are lips to what is wandering here 
Feeling you underfoot in the rocky night. 
Moving about like "wind, blowing you clear 
Of mists, hanging your leaves with drops of light. 

Listen! There is a sound of water falling 
Down the dark-shafted night into the trees. 
Wild birds that should be quiet now are calling. 
How shall I sleep tonight, troubled with these? 
The cool wind through the moon's invisible strings 
Blows like a striking of dear silver bars; 
The great black peak shudders and leaps and swings, 
And I am blinded by the fall of stars. 

I cannot rest. I cannot quiet my limbs. 
A sense of climbing keeps my body burning, 
And the white flame sweeps over me and dims 
All that inclines within me toward returning. 
Did I see only earth once long ago. 
And only flesh in faces turned to me? 
Sleep? Rest? With my senses shaken so 
And the world's valleys lost so dizzily? 


Raymond Holden 

Why have I come so near the fearful stars 
When what is in me is so much a want 
Of utter dark too thick for any wars 
Of flesh and spirit dazzlingly to haunt? 
I do not know. I do not want to know; 
Only to make a fire of weariness 
And fling myself upon it» and burn, and go 
Thinly, like smoke, to wind-walled quietness. 

Raymond Holden 



THESE FIELDS AT EVENING 

These wear their evening light as women wear 
Their pale proud beauty for some lover's sake, 
Too quiet-hearted evermore to care 
For moving worlds and musics that they make; 
And they are hushed as lonely women are — 
So lost in dreams they have no thought to mark 
How the wide heavens blossom, star by star, 
And the slow dusk is deepening to the dark. 

The moon comes like a lover from the hill. 
Leaning across the twilight and the trees; 
And finds them grave and beautiful and still. 
And wearing always, on such nights as these, 
A glimmer less than any ghost of light. 
As women wear their beauty through the night. 

David Morton 

MAXIXE 

Los enanitos 
Se enojaren 

{Old Mexican Song) 

The Mexican dwarfs can dance for miles. 

Stamping their feet and scattering smiles; 

Till the loud hills laugh and laugh again 

At the dancing dwarfs in the golden plain. 

Till the bamboos sing as the dwarfs dance by 

Kicking their feet at a jagged sky. 

That, torn by leaves and gashed by hills. 

Rocks to the rhythm the hot sun shrills. 

The bubble sun sketches shadows that pass 

To noiseless jumping-jacks of glass 

So long and thin, so silent and opaque, 

That the lions shake their orange manes, and quake, 

And a shadow that leaps over Popocatepetl 

Terrifies the tigers, as they settle 

Cat-like limbs cut with golden bars 

Under bowers of flowers that shimmer like stars. 

Buzzing of insects flutters above. 

Shaking the rich trees' treasure-trove 

Till the fruit rushes down, like a comet whose tail 

Thrashes the night with its golden flail. 

The fruit hisses down with a plomp from its tree. 

Like the singing of a rainbow as it dips into the sea. 

Loud red trumpets of great blossoms blare 


Osbert Sitwe/l 

Triumphantly like heralds who blow a fanfare; 
Till the humming-bird> bearing heaven on its wing» 
Flies from the terrible blossoming, 
And the humble honey-bee is frightened by the fine 
Honey that is heavy like money, and purple like wine; 
While birds that flaunt their pinions like pennons 
Shriek from their trees of oranges and lemons. 
And the scent rises up in a cloud, to make 
The hairy swinging monkeys feel so weak 
That they each throw down a bitten cocoanut or mango. 
Up flames a flamingo over the fandango; 
Glowing like a fire, and gleaming like a ruby. 
From Guadalajara to Guadalupe 
It flies; in flying drops a feather . . . 
And the snatching dwarfs stop dancing and fight together. 

Osieri Sitwell 



FRIENDSHIP 

No foe could strike this blow — 

Could draw this blood, this tear! 
By the deep wound I know 

A friend was here. 

Daniel Henderson 
COCKLE SHELLS 

THE SHIP 

"The sky is great and the land is great and the ocean is 

great," said he; 
''And a bird is a lovely thing in the air, and a supple fish 

in the sea; 
And a horse is a beautiful thing to watch, running so 

gay and free. 

"But a ship that is built of land-grown oak, with her 

sails in the wind," said he, 
"And who goes and comes in the very thick of the calm 

and storm of the sea. 
Is light as a bird and swift as a fish, and like a horse runs 

free!" 

THE cows 

I have seen cows that lay in the summer meadows. 

Hearing the sound of breezes amidst the grass 

While every hair in the sunlight glittered with rainbows. 

Oh, but they were bland and placid and smooth and 

beautiful! 
Their mates were great bulls with curl-matted horns 
And the bellow of lions. 
Their offspring were playful and gay, 


Elizabeth Coatsworth 

With innocent staring eyes. 

Laborers toiled in the fields to find them food for the 

winter, 
And built them against the wind dark temples scented 

with hay; 
While women eased them of milk 
That swelled their udders at twilight. 
I have seen cows that lay in the meadows like gods, 
Breathing forth peace that smelled of dampness and 

clover. 

STREAM 

Like a troubadour riding to battle, 

Flinging his sword in the air 

And catching it 

As he sings. 

The stream comes in white armor down the hillside. 

BROADWAY 

That man has the head of a goat and the paunch of Silenus, 
As he walks down the sidewalk alone conventionally 

going to dine. 
His little bright eyes are glancing, his little hard feet are 

prancing 
As though all the crowd about him were maenads and 

fawns in a line. 

The horns of the motors for him are puffed by the cheeks 

of centaurs; 
The buildings and shops are cliffs, draped and festooned 

with the vine. 
The little cane that he swings he has used on the ribs of 

his donkey 
When the ground was rocking with laughter and the trees 

were reeling with wine. 

AT VERSAILLES 

I have watched the hours pass along the walks of Versailles 

Among the drifting autumn leaves: 

Madame Four-O'Clock a tumble of silken skirts and smiles, 

On a donkey her lover lured forward with brown southern 
pears. 

Madame Five-0'Clock, pouting among the petunias; 

Flower-face, flower-hands, flower-breasts barely sheathed 
in her bodice. 

Madame Six-0'Clock languishing by a balustrade, 

Her thin yellow hand on the head of a black page. 

And Madame Seven, a white shadow among the tree- 
trunks. 

As still and as arch as the statues upon their p>edestals. 

Elizabeth Coatstoorth 




PORTRAIT OF A HOUSE 

Far from a town 

I know a house that's a girl's dream come true. 

And there is one room done in blue> 

In queer still blues, with shades drawn down. 

In a room near 

Are candles, thick as a man's arm, 
Of yellow wax, and then a warm 
Great golden bowl of burning bloom; 
And past, there is a little room 
For tea, and being glad and proud 
One is alive. There is a crowd 
Of tall flowers shaken as with fear 
Outside a door. And walking by 
Three great windows filled with sky. 
We came to a Chinese room 
Where a Buddha sits in gloom. 
He is as still as witchery 
But in his eyes weird things I see. 
Like the waiting to be wild 
In the eyes of a young child. 

Past this room arc wonders still — 
Altar vestures from Brazil, 
Blue and silver ones and red; 
She loves old rich things. She said, 
"Cream or lemon in your tea?" 

In a strange laughing voice. She has 
Dusk eyes, I think, or maybe blue. 
And a heart for telling secrets to. 

A bear-skin out of- Russia yawns 

On her wide hall. There have been dawns 

A-many on her waiting lawns. 

The rocky cliffside, glacier-scarred, 
And mountain trails are in her yard. 
The widest river of the west 
Goes past her door. There is a jest 
In all she does, and a greatness too. 
And little gardens hidden where 
Her guests find them unaware. 

Gravely in the court beyond 
Her gardeners have made a pond 
Where waterlilies were, and where 
They are gone now, except two rare 
And perfect ones, like trembling young 
Shy things; and deep and red among 
The lily roots the goldfish go 
In a discontented row. 
Breaking and wheeling. A white wall 
Bears bowls of trailing vines. There fall 
Out of the air great seagulls. High 
Cliffs and rough crags break up the sky. 
Across the river; and beyond 



 



Mary Carolyn Davits 



The level lawn, the level pond, 

The mountain rises menacing; 

And a great waterfall comes down 

Like a sullen tiger's spring. 

I have watched her calm eyes cling 

To the waterfall — while slow 

And sweet she spoke, in her still way, 

Of books and men that we two know. 

Prisoner in her house she dwells. 
As do we all. Our rooms are cells. 
Loveliness is only bars 
To shut out faces from the stars. 



THE LAST OF THE COWBOYS 

They have gone down like the sunset, who like the sun 
Were mighty and high and scornful; their hour is done. 
Slowly into the night they ride, each one. 

They have gone down like the sunset, sharp on the hill. 
A moment against the sky they stood, until 
The dark came down and they met it, stoic and still. 

Mary Carolyn Davies 



YOUR WORDS 

God gave you wordSy so you must give them to me. 

Let me lie here on the ground 

Breaking brittle pine-needles with my fingers. 

You have no right to keep a gift — 

God gave you words ^ so you must give them to me. 

Your words are perfect things — 
They are birds with full smooth breasts. 

That fly in wide clean skies 
And sleep in warm brown nests. 

Your words are little globes 

Of glasSy or ruby-flake; 
They tinkle in the air 

And whisper as they break. 

Your words are little ships 

With silver shining sails, 
That sing against the winds 

Like purple nightingales. 

Your words are colored fruits 

In crystal jars, and tail. 
You break them with your lips; 

I catch them as they fall. 

So give me your words. Let them slip 
Cool fingers through my hair. 


Athena McFadden 

There is no world but me, no heaven but you. . . 
Somewhere outside of these there may be birds y 
And fruity and ships y and little crystal globes. 

For me there are only your words. . . 

Athena McFadden

Everywhere they flee: 
Emptier than air 

Are the world and we." 

Who has heard the madmen 

Shall remember long 
AU their goblin music 

And their goblin song.

POETRY; A Magazine of Verse 

FA>rrASY 

High in the cloudy skies. 

Along the barren hills. 

Where short brown grass grows sparingly and spots of 

orange earth shine forth, 
Where trees of sombre brown uprise. 
Fantastic horses roam. 

Cropping the scanty grass. 

Their full white tails blown outward by the wind. 

They move about majestically with slow and tranquil step. 

Their necks are strangely thin and beautiful. 
Their fiery eyes, fixed steadily on the ground, 
Seem to be contemplating inward wonders. 
With their unshod hoofs they leave no mark on the 
bare hard earth. 

Slowly they move. 

With their heads bent downward 

Munching the short spare grass, 

While the passing clouds, grey with incipient storm, 

Hang low over the hills. 

They know no day nor night, 

Those pale fantastic horses; 

For daylight on the hills is but a cloud-grey shadow. 

And night is faintly luminous with livid mist. 


Helen C, Russmann 

Slowly they roam, 

With their unsleeping eyes fixed inward. 

Treading with easy step the inaccessible heights, 

Moving in tranquil peace 

Along the cloudy hills.

TWO POEMS 

MOONLIGHT 

It has covered the earth as this sheet my knee 
Where my body lies like a reed in snow. 
It has altered my room to a satin tomb. 
It has made of my soul a silver flute — 
A silver flute in a white case, mute; 
A silver flute filled with prisoned song. 
Long shrill song for your lips to free. 

CONVENT 

As into a blue lake 

The little drops of days 

Fall quietly. 

The lake fills but does not stir.

THREE POEMS 

OLD AGE 

Drink. 

The fountain is bending low. 
It is being filled with emptiness. 
The day is spilling its light. 

Drink, 

Bending the unyielding knee. 

There's a tremor 

In the thought of height — 

The snow of the years is fallen. 

Drink. 

The black shadows are toppling 

Over into thin waters. 

In the night. 

When thou art removed 

From the fountain. 

Thy thirst will cease to be 

A burden. 

A vision shall fill the night. 

OUR SORROW 

Your sorrow died, 
And you buried it; 

ri38j 



 



Aha N. Turner 



And then you dried 

Your tears 

As you went your way 

Forgetting it: 

While mine lives through the years. 

Men understood your sorrow 

Because it died, 

And pitied your tears. 

Which you have dried; 

But they leer at my sorrow 

And sneer, 

Because it lives through the years. 



MARGARETTE 

She's a clever little witch. 

And knows it; 

But it has not spoiled her heart. 

The beauty of her tressed head 

Is enhanced by the cunning of her fingers. 

Her piquant and mobile face 

Reflects 

The sunshine of her soul. 

And betrays the clouds of it. 

I like to study her face. 

[139J 




 

Her sky-blue eyes 

Vie with the softness 

Of the summer heavens, 

When the nimbus has fled 

And cumulus dreams on the sky-line. 

The naif beauty of her white teeth 

Remains intact, 

And laughs 

At the dedal ruse of the dentist. 

Last Sunday, at the spring 

Which pours its potable silver 

For the mendicant town of Spring Garden, 

She said with a smile. 

Before Lillian and the others. 

That she believed 

She'd made a great hit with me. 

I mocked the smile of her. 

And confessed that she had. 

She's twenty and Fm forty — 
But that's no difference to her; 
For she's a clever little witch. 
And knows it.

Furious little bit of curis 
Struggling against the gale! 

Mad at God because the wind 
Is stronger than her tiny body. 

But little girl. 

You do not have to! 

Turn about, • 

And let it take you. 

Fluttering, laughing, 

Over the prairie, 

Butterflying through the air.

Shall we worship you 
As god of Laughter 
And Good-nature — 
Or shall we crisp your flesh 
As sacrificial offering

"Is mine," says the sea. 

"I bring birds what makes trees." 

"I pile sand for to make beaches." 

"Is mine what for I love it." 

"Is mine what for I marry it." 

Typhoon takeit island by trees. 
Sea grab at the beaches. 
Un when they is through — 
Palms piled like jack-straws, 
Beaches pulled to pieces.

COMMENT 

PROSODY 

A RECENT discussion of prosody in The Freeman 
brought so many disputants to the fore, each with 
a different point of view, as to remind at least one of 
them of the welter of chaos and confusion in which that 
so-called science finds itself foundering today. Since poets 
and scholiasts are so at loggerheads about the funda- 
mental technique of the verse-art practiced by the one 
group and analyzed by the other, it may be well to 
remind ourselves of the basic origins of rhythm, and of 
the history, not of poetry itself, but of the system of laws 
formulated and developed by grammarians from the study 
of poetry. 

Rhythm is of course a universal principle, the very 
pulse-beat of life and of all the arts. From the amoeba 
to man, from the atom to the star, rhythm, or power 
moving regularly in time-beats, is a recognizable law 
which all creation must obey. The more closely modern 
science studies the universe — through microscope, tele- 
scope, or the naked eye and brain of man — the more 
astonishing and magnificent becomes this infinite har- 
mony: an intricate weaving of small patterns within 
great ones, a march of ordered melody, outreaching 
human eyes and ears, outracing even that "only reality" 
the human imagination. The arts are an effort to join 
in, to weave little imitation patterns, sound little imita- 


Prosody 

don tunes. Even the static arts must respond with 
balanced form and color in painting, sculpture, architec- 
ture — else their manifestations are temporary and in- 
congruous, part of the perishable scum and waste. 

Music and poetry seem to have been among the earliest 
and most direct human manifestations of the universal 
rhythmic impulse. At first they were united — lyric rap- 
ture instinctively fitted words to melody, as it does still 
in certain forms of spontaneous folk-song like keening 
over the dead or other primitive rhapsodies of prayer and 
praise. But as life became more complex, the two arts 
separated, developed each its own imaginative and techni- 
cal expression of the rhythmic instinct. Literature began 
in the creation of poems too beautiful to be left to chance 
memories and tongues, and therefore committed to writ- 
ing. After the passing centuries had heaped up an 
accumulation of these masterpieces, the analysts took 
hold of them; and out of the practice of dead poets 
grammarians began to make rules for poets yet to come. 

Thus prosody was born. And thus gradually it 
developed into a rigid science of verse-structure, a science 
about as scientific, from the modern point of view, as 
the astronomy or chemistry of the classic and mediaeval 
periods. For a brief review of its history one need go 
no further than Edmund Gosse's article on Verse in the 
Britannica. It was Aristoxenus of Tarentum, a gram- 
marian contemporary with Alexander the Great and 
therefore much later than the golden age of Greek poetry, 

who "first laid down definite laws for prosody as a depart- 
ment of musical art.'* From his time 

The theories of verae tended to release themselves from the theories 
of music. Rules, often of a highly arbitrary nature, were drawn up 
by grammarians, who founded their laws on a scholiasdc study of the 
ancient poets. 

One Hephaestion wrote a manual of Greek metres in 
the second century A. D., which became an authority 
in both the Byzantine and the Alexandrian schools, and, 
printed at last in 1526, carried on his influence into 
modern languages. Of the elaborate system of classic 
verse-structure set forth by these and other analysts Mr. 
Gosse reminds us: 

It must not be forgotten that the prosodical terminology of the Greeks, 
which b often treated by non-poetical writers as something scientific 
and even sacrosanct, dates from a time when ancient literature had lost 
all its freshness and impulse, and was exclusively the study of analysts 
and grammarians. 

However, the classic nomenclature — the dactyls, ana- 
paests, spondees, iambs, etc., of Greek and Latin, languages 
whose syllabic quantities were fairly rigid — was carried 
over into modern tongues of much more changeable 
quantities and emphatic stresses. Naturally it has proved 
a misfit; especially in English it is inaccurate and mis- 
leading — a mediaeval remainder strangely anachronistic 
in this age of scientific research. It has been a hampering 
influence, and would have be^n perhaps a destructive one 
if the poets, most of them, had not preserved either an 
invincible ignorance or a cold-hearted indifiFerence against 


Prosody 

all the wiles of prosodic theory. I know two or three of 
high distinction who don't know an iamb from a cellar- 
door, and couldn't scan their poems according to formula 
to save their necks from the Lord High Executioner. 

But this virginal innocence, however desirable in the 
face of a false prosody, might learn much to its advantage 
from a prosody as accurate and scientifically complete as 
the system of musical notation which has so enormously 
stimulated musical production. As I said in the Freeman: 

In any inquiry into poetic rhythms, one is seriously handicapped 
by the ineuctness of the old terms. Prosody, regarded as the science 
of versfr-notation, is today about as scientific as pre-Galilean astronomy. 
Its inherited ancient terms — ^iambic, trochaic, anapaestic, dactylic, etc. — 
deserve no better fate than the scrap-heap, after which a modern science 
of prosody might be built upon sound foundations. Indeed, a begin- 
ning has been made. There is quite a bibliography of scientific articles 
by philologists, chiefly German, on the subject of speech-rhythms 
and verse-rhythms; and Dr. William Morrison Patterson, formerly of 
Columbia University, has made a most valuable contribution in his 
volume, The RhytJsm of Prose^ and in the phonographic researches 
which led up to it. In reviewing thb book in April, 191 8, 1 said: 

"I am quite out of sympathy with those sensitive poetic souls who 
resent this intrusion of science. The truth can do no harm, and in 
this case it must do incalculable good in the enrichment of our sense 
of rhythmic values. The poet of the future, discarding the wilful 
empiricism of the past and proceeding upon exact knowledge, will greatly 
develop and enrich our language-rhythms just as music-rhythms are 
being devebped and enriched by composers fully educated in their art, 
who add knowledge and training to that primal impulse of heart and 
mind which we call genius. The poet hitherto has worked in the dark, 
or at least in a shadow-land illumined only by his own intuidon. 
Henceforth science will lend her lamp; she unll hand him the laws of 
rhythm just as she hands to the painter the laws of light and color, or 
to the architect the laws of proportion and stress." 

Of course modern investigators, including Mr. Bridges, recognize 
that even common human speech falls necessarily iiSto what Sievers 
calls SprechtakUy or speech-bars, rhythm being a universal law which 
prose must obey as well as poetry. So Nfr. Bridges b in accord with 
the scientists in declaring that "in English accentual measures the nat- 
ural speech-groupings must be supreme." 

Prof, Patterson's researches were interrupted a few 
years ago, unfortunately, by his resignation from the 
faculty of Columbia University. At present he is living 
in old Charleston, where, according to a recent letter, he 
hopes soon to resume his study of this subject. The 
work of a progressive scientific mind in this much-befc^ged 
specialty cannot fail to be illuminating. H. M. 



REVIEWS 

CHARLOTTE MEW 

Saturday Market^ by Charlotte Mew. Macmillan Co. 

A slim book of verse laden with so much observation, 
knowledge, passion, sentiment, that it is like an apple-tree 
burdened by the excess of its own beauty. Almost each 
poem has the material in it for innumerable poems, and 
almost each poem is weighed down with words. Yet 
though Miss Mew lacks simplicity, she never lacks interest. 
I think, in fact, that this book would appeal to a larger 
audience than any book of verse published in the past 
two years, with the possible exception of Edna St. Vin- 
cent Millay's Second April; because the poems tell stories, 


Charlotte Mew 

and tell them with genuine dramatic feeling. For in- 
stance. The Farmer* s Bride: 

Three summers since I chose a maid, 

Too young maybe — but more's to do 

At harvest-time than bide and woo. 

When us was wed she turned afraid 

Of love and me and all things human; 

Like the shut of a winter's day. 

Her smile went out, and 'twasn't a woman — 

More like a little frightened fay. 

One night, in the fall, she runned away. 

"Out 'mong the sheep her be," they said — 

Should properly have been abed. 

But sure enough she wasn't there, 

Lying awake with her wide brown stare. 

So over seven-acre field and up-along across the down 

We chased her flying like a hare 

Before our lanterns. To Church-town 

All in a shiver and a scare 

We caught her, fetched her home at last, 

And turned the key upon her fast. 

She does the work about the house 
As well as most, but like a mouse; 
Happy enough to chat and play 
With birds and rabbits and such as they. 
So long as men-folk keep away. 
"Not here, not here!" her eyes beseech 
When one of us comes within reach. 
The women say that beasts in stall 
Look round like children at her call, 
/'or hardly heard her speak at all. 

Shy as a leveret, swift as he, 

Straight and slight as a young larch tree, 

Sweet as the first wild violets, she. 
To her wild self. But what to me? 

The short days shorten and the oaks are brown. 
The blue smoke rises to the low grey sky, 
One leaf in the still air falls slowly down, 
A magpie's spotted feathers lie 
On the black earth spread white with rime. 
The berries redden up to Christmas time. 
What's Christmas time without there be 
Some other in the house than we I 

She sleeps up in the attic there 

Alone, poor maid. "Tis but a stair 

Betwixt us. O my God! the down. 

The soft young down of her, the brown. 

The brown of her — her eyes, her hair, her hair! 

The above, I think, shows Miss Mew at her best. She 
has taken one idea and has handled it with restraint. In 
the longer poems, such as Madeleine in Church and The 
^uiet Housey she is in danger of becoming melodramatic 
and verbose. And frequently she loses all sense of word- 
sound, as in the cacophanous ending of this stanza: 

Red is the strangest pain to bear: 

In spring the leaves on the budding trees; 

In summer the roses are worse than these, 

More terrible than they are sweet — 

A rose can stab you across the street 

Deeper than any knife. 

And the crimson haunts you ever3rwhere — 

Thin shafts of sunlight, like the ghosts of reddened swords, have 

struck our stair, 
As if, coming down, you had split your life. 

The final lines are as unpleasant to the ear as a finger- 

Charlotte Mew 

nail drawn across a blackboard; particularly as they 
follow lines of accurate beauty. 

Almost all of the poems are objective, which, in itself, 
is refreshing in this age when so many poets emphasize 
the diminutive iHutterings of their colossd ego. And the 
fact that Miss Mew successfully subordinates her own 
personality to that of the characters in her poems proves 
her a mature artist. There is nothing slap-dash about 
her, nothing young — her sophistication has mellowed to 
wisdom. And when she does not try to impart too much 
of her knowledge, we are exalted by it: 

Tide be runnin' the great world over: 

T'was only last June month I mind than we 

Was thinkin' the toss and the call in the breast of the lover 

So everlastin' as the sea. 

Here's the same little fishes that sputter and swim, 

Wi' the moon's old glim on the grey wet sand; 

An' him no more to me nor me to him 

Than the wind goin' over my hand.

A SPIRIT OF QUEST 

ExplorationSy by Robert McAlmon. Egoist Press, London. 
If poetry is an easily understood, self-fulfilling bead- 
string of so-called beautiful images that he who runs may 
read; if it implies not a continual rebellion to standardized 
beauty; if it should be simple and naive; then this bitter 
burning caustic stuff, the broken rhythm of it, the laby- 
rinthine sophistication of it, have nothing to do with 

[iSS] 




 

Pegasus. The old venerable horse would lose his head in 
it and get his hoofs scorched. McAlmon seeks — it is hard 
to say just what he seeks; there is a spirit of quest in this 
book. We might call it the struggle of the poet versus 
his own sophistication. For that he is a poet some lines 
tell even to the skeptical: 

Between sunrise and sunrise any life is left pendulating. 
What if a few stars are stitched 
To the hem of the garment one cannot throw ofF— 
The sky one cannot look far into? 

and 

I have been a vermilion geyser breaking into petals of hot mist that 
A'eeze to crack, clink ing on the too thin-ringing glass of silence. 

The very spirit of quest and struggle is in this book and 
it is that which makes McAlmon say: 

Wind, wear yourself to stillness, to death — do not listen to the careful 
ones. Do not subside. You inevitably shall be made to, but 
never degrade yourself with ingratiation. 

These are essentials to that spirit which prompted 
Prometheus* theft — the poetic spirit. 

The tedium and the nausea of sophistication, with the 
struggle thereof, are emphasized in this slim book. Yet 
McAlmon is sometimes simple and direct. Witness his 
book of short stories and "momentary" essays — thus he 
calls them — A Hasty Bunch: stories which are plotless, 
unfinished and sketchy, but always honest, always inter- 
esting and often very free; with a dark sullen trend of 
fatalism running through them. What is best in Explora-

A Spirit of ^uest 

tionSy The Via Dolorosa of Art (a beautiful title!), is a 
rather simple song of the mood that precedes artistic 
conception; indeed it is rather adolescent, taking the word 
not to mean derogation but a rather charming insecure- 
ness and transparency. The same could be said of Mood 
Decisions and Prose Sketches^ which are, like the face of 
the artist of Via Dolorosa^ "sullen with youth," often 
boisterous and sometimes bombastic. In striking con- 
trast these are with some other poems which sound like — 
did you ever hear a vaudeville actor string a lot of high- 
sounding nonsense words? In the Via Dolorosa there is 
perhaps too much nomenclature, and nomenclature means 
a vain effort at conception. McAlmon makes an impres- 
sion. It may be unpleasant — it all depends: a youth, 
agile and attractive, passing by without taking his hat 
off to anybody. Emanuel Camevali 

A PROMISE 

The Golden Darkness, by Oscar Williams. Yale University 
Press. In Gossamer Grey, by Oscar Williams. The 
Bookfellows, Chicago. 

The ghost of tradition no longer walks, insinuating 
repetition; conventionalities of form have been cast aside 
as snares and delusions. Yet anarchy also is being ruled 
out — it has begun to be remembered that discipline is one 
of the duties of the artist, for of what virtue the title 
"artist" if selection and organization are to be left to 

the public? The new generation of poets, studying the 
French symbolists, going to school in technique to William 
Butler Yeats, H. D., and Wallace Stevens; infusing a new 
jflexibility into old forms with Edna Millay — the new 
generation has done with the inchoate. Perfection has 
again become the grail: subtlety is demanded of rhythm 
and rhyme, and profundity of observation. One says 
what one has to say and ends. Above all, no digression 
or elaboration for the sake of the mechanics. 

Oscar Williams, however, is no disciplinarian. His is a 
gift-horse into whose mouth he has not looked. He has 
taken it, been duly grateful, cherished it, and spared it 
heavy burdens. 

Nature, naively as in primitive religions, is his protag- 
onist. She is his lady, and he is her troubadour. In a 
rhythm subtle only by instinct, in facile rhyme, in image 
and execution varying from the painfully beautiful to the 
painfully mediocre, he sings without affectation and in a 
single strain like a bird. The beauties of dawn, of stars, 
of the palpable dusk of twilight, and the palpable darkness 
of night, prick him like needles, urging him to his single- 
noted song, and his gyrations, as of a dancing dervish, 
ever and ever around in the same spot. One is aware, 
however, above all, of an authentic urge, aware that 
Oscar Williams is a poet and no mistake. In spite of an 
endless repetition of grandiloquent abstractions — ^mystery, 
darkness, vastness, strangeness, grandeur, glamour — in 
spite of banal rhythm and rhyme, one realizes that when 


A Promise 

Oscar Williams arrives at the maturity promised by the 
isolated lines quoted below, he will be a far better poet 
than he is now. 

One does not demand great depth of thought of one's 
lyrists. We shall be satisfied if Oscar Williams but plucks 
consistently: 

And far away the poised gray mountains, 
Like billows caught in a trance. 

The tears within the twilight's eyes. 

Fantasy is lithe like a hound. 

And he compares the emergence of the earth at dawn to 
"a clenched fist, knuckled with crags." 

The Golden Darkness {In Gossamer Gray is in eflFect 
supplementary) is a promise and not a fulfilment. The 
young poet has just awakened; he stands before life 
rubbing the mist from his eyes. He has experienced 
little. He has not yet begun to sing of love, that primal 
theme of lyrists. Life hides behind a fog, secretive, 
illusory. When he has done rubbing his eyes, he may 
come into that clarity of vision one demands of good 
creative work, no matter how subjective or how mystical. 
At present he is a novitiate who has taken his first vows. 

Ruminations is perhaps the poem that oflFers most in 
quotation: 

"So," I said, "I am feeling 

What I shall always feel— 
The sharp toe of a stone, 

And a shadow's heel." 

"So," I said, "I am seeing 

What I shall always see — 
The snow blossoms of moonlight 

Blowing on a tree." 

"So," I said, "I am hearing 

What I shall always hear — 
The winds with hair of starlight 

Crying wild and clear." 

"So," I said, "I glory in 

What shall always be mine — 
The flowers flushing red 

In the sky's blue wine." 

"So," I said, "I am living 

What I may not be — 
A dusty masterpiece, 

A mouldy biography." 


SLIGHT SONGS 

Songs from the Journey^ by Wilton Agnew Barrett. Geo. 

H. Doran Co. 

Unfortunately for Mr. Barrett, one feels an almost 
irresistible impulse to review the publisher's blurb upon 
the slip-cover of this volume rather then the relatively 
unimaginative poems which the volume contains. The 
advertising agent who could speak of these frail and some- 
what crudely made vessels for an evident sincerity and 
almost painful earnestness as the "strange songs vibrant 
with passion" of a poet "humanly great, yet clear of 
eye for the little things" (why "yet," we wonder?) 
deserves individual attention. It is a pity that the 

[i6o] 



 



Slight Songs 

blurb is so conspicuously placed as to demand a readings 
since it gives a distorted idea of the poems within. 

These are the work of a poet, seemingly young or 
inexperienced, who sings without much originality of 
how youth intoxicates itself with the sights and sounds 
of the city at dusk or refreshes itself under the country 
pines. Mr. Barrett pauses to pay appropriate tribute to 
Francis Thompson, to A. £. Housman, to Stephen 
Phillips; and his work gives back now and then a faint 
echo of the two last-named poets, and even of Alfred 
Noyes. His verse lacks the smoothness that one expects 
from an admirer of Housman, however. One observes a 
gift for inept metaphor: "a bouquet of young clouds," 
**the scarf of evening sea flows far adown the grassy 
beach," "Trees with fretted stars In their lacy hair"; 
and a disregard for the assonances of English speech, 
which leads him into such phrases as "the love-loveli- 
ness of leaves." Nor has he any great respect for the 
mot juste: here are adjectives of almost inconceivable 
clumsiness — "unbefrenzied laughter"; adjectives long 
since threadbare — "impenetrable, obliterating years"; 
and adjectives that set one's teeth on edge — "his cozy 
spouse." 

Yet in spite of these defects, most of which are due to 
immaturity and are therefore excusable in a first book; 
the poems have the charm of sincerity and of a sympa-

Dead Man. Some of his pictures are skilfully constructed, 
even if unmagical; there is vividness in Miriam — a 
white birch in a pine forest — and in his portrayal of 
tanagers in a city square, 

Where toiling Adam stops to watch, 
Tired Eve forgets her apple. 

Mr. Barrett says somewhere "I am looking for stars"; 
and in that voicing of his determined search he has 
revealed his worst trespasses against poetry — self- 
consciousness and straining after e(Fect. Are not stars

A JAPANESE COSMOPOLITE 

Seen and Unseen: or Monologues of a Homeless Snail^ 
by Yone Noguchi. (New ed.) Orientalia, New York. 
Selected Poems of Yone Noguchi, selected by himself. 
The Four Seas Co. 

With the publication of Seen and Unseen in 1898, in 
San Francisco, Yone Noguchi came into being, and with 
him came a new tide of oriental influence into our litera- 
ture. Ethical teachings, philosophy of life manufac- 
tured by human intellect, and long narrative stories 
were entirely absent from his poems. He wrote as he 
felt — this is the essence of oriental poetry. While the 
West was busy preaching to the people through its 
poetry, the East discarded intellectual discussions and 


A Japanese Cosmopolite 

devoted itself to creating mood; if philosophy entered 

at all, it was the result of the poet's feeling and not of 

his intellect. Although the poems in Seen and Unseen 

were a little nebulous and undefined, they were the first 

poetry of an oriental expressed in English. 

Reading through selections from Voice of the Valley 

we find this passage, in Song of "Day in Yosemite Valley: 

The shout of hell wedded to the silence of heaven completes the 
valley concert. 

To feel that strange silence of the mountains and the 
sky in the roar of the fall is typically Japanese. To feel 
and create this poetic silence, and through it to suggest 
the roar, the power, and the majesty of the fall without 
describing it, is the mission of Japanese poets. And if 
such a poem is successfully written it has infinitely 
stronger expression, at least to a Japanese, than hun- 
dreds of adjectives piled upon each other by western 
poets. Yone felt this silence, and had he been completely 
a Japanese poet, he would have centered his effort in 
the creation of the silence, instead of in describing the 
sublimity of the fall as he did in the opening of this 
poem: "O thunderous opening of the unseen gate!" 

But this is not a Japanese poem. Yone felt the mood 
of Japanese poetry, and expressed it to a certain degree 
through the western medium. Should western readers 
discover that strange silence in his poetry, his mission 
will be fulfilled. Whether they do or not, time alone 
will tell. The so-called oriental influence in western 

literature today, I am afraid, is taking the form it has 
assumed in the other arts, which, to a great extent, have 
adopted the carcass of Japanese pictures and missed the 
essence. In this respect Tone's Japanese HokkuSy pub- 
lished in 1920, is misleading. For example: 

Speak not Again, Voice; 
The silence washes off sins* 
Come not again. Light. 

This is written in a hokku form, seventeen syllables 
in three lines. But the form does not make a hokku. 
Some of the best hokkus are written without this form. 
Where is that fine and illusive mood, big enough to 
illuminate the infinity of the universe, which is essential 
to the hokku? I cannot find it. This verse may be 
poetic, but perhaps it should have more words, more 
lines, and stronger expression. The hokku is not con- 
densed milk; condensed milk never becomes cream. 
Most of Tone's hokkus sound almost like those of Amy 
Lowell, which miss the essential quality of the type. 
Miss Lowell is of course ignorant of Japanese, but Yone 
has no such excuse. 

• The free verse of today has moved far away from the 
example which Yone set during the nineties; but it owes 
something to him; it acknowledges frankly enough the 
oriental influence. Jun Fujita 




Dante in English Rhyme 

DANTE IN ENGLISH RHYME 

The Divine Comedy of Dante Alighieri (line for line trans- 

Iation)> by Melville Best Anderson. World Book Co., 

New York. 

No translation of The Divine Comedy can be altogether 
acceptable unless in rhyme. Prose, however faithful, is 
wholly inadequate; blank verse, however skilful, is not 
much better. And the rhyme ought to be (titanic achieve- 
ment!) the terza rima of the original — that endless chain 
which imposes poetry upon those pedestrian passages 
that occur even in Dante. 

Furthermore, no version of the Comedy^ not even the 
original, is fully intelligible and effective without notes. 
These need not be detdled, nor need they busy themselves 
over minor points; but they must be present for the sake 
of a broad and general guidance through the intricacies 
of Dante's great conception and the labyrinth of an 
erudition which drew upon all the learning of the time. 
And if these notes be marginal, rather than at the bottom 
of the page or at the end of the volume, their usefulness 
is increased threefold. 

These requirements are met in the newest translation 
of the Comedy — that of Dr. Melville B. Anderson, now 
presented after twenty years of labor. This translation 
is in the triple rhyme of the original, and is practically 
line for line. Dr. Anderson has favored the strong, 
simple, direct words of our English speech, with scant 
dependence upon Latinized "limbs and outward flour- 

ishes." Though the employment of terza rima was 
discouraged by such a Dante scholar as Charles Eliot 
Norton, its use here may be pronounced highly successful. 
The rhyme-scheme is maintained with considerable 
taste and skill throughout, and many lines equal the 
concision and impressiveness of the original ones, with 
no loss of poetic quality. 

The nub of the Comedy is the thirtieth canto of the 
Purgatorioy with the appearance of Beatrice in the car; 
and the climax of the work is the Beatific Vision, in the 
last canto of the Paradiso. Brief excerpts will show 
Dr. Anderson's treatment of these crucial passages. 

"Blessed be thou that comestl" cried that band, 
Filling the air with flowers along the way; 
"O give ye lilies all with liberal hand!"— 

is assuredly a satisfactory equivalent for — 

Tutti dicean: "Benedictus qui vents** 
e fior gittando di sopra e dintomo: 
"Manibus o date lilia pienis!" — 

and is none the worse for being in one language. 

With Hallelujah on requickened tongue 
is a noble equivalent for — 

la rivestita voce alleluiando; 

and 

Angels and ministers of life eteme 

stands effectively for — 

ministri e messaggier di vita eterna, 

[i66] 



 



Dante in English Rhyme 

unless a stress, perhaps undue, be laid on the fact that 
"ministers," scripturally, form but one of the general 
order of "angels." 

In the Beatific Vision of the Trinity, the translator 
employs hendacasyllables — speaking roughly, our so-called 
"weak ending." This is of course in high conformity 
with the scheme of the original — I believe there are but 
six ten-syllable lines in the entire Comedy: 

To me within the luminous deep being 

Of Lofty Light appeared three circles, showing 
Three Colors, and in magnitude agreeing; 

And from the First appeared the Second flowing 
Like Iris out of Iris, and the Third 
Seemed fire that equally from both is glowing. 

Truly, in English, the eleven-syllable line leans heavily 
on the present participle. 

Immediately afterward comes a passage in which the 
line-for-line principle is set aside. 

O luce eterna, che sola in te sidi, 
sola t'intendi, e da te intelletta 
ed intendente te ami e arridi! 

becomes: 

O Light Eterne, who dost thyself include, 
Who lovest, smiling at thy own intents. 
Self-understanding and self-understood! — 

a departure which is more than justified by the splendid 
success of the concluding line. 

The notes, as I have indicated, are placed where they 
do the most service; and they often have a touch of un- 

conventionality and informality which makes them not 
only serviceable but enjoyable. For minor detailed 
points the translator refers us, properly enough, to well- 
known and easily accessible handbooks. 

In make-up the volume b handsome and intelligent. 
Cover, jacket, and the few illustrations are highly apropos. 
However, the number of the canto might have shown in 
the running heads; and it would have done no harm if 
the lines themselves had been numbered by the usual 
threes or fives. 

On the whole, a great achievement. Possessing 
Scartazzini in Italian and Anderson in English, one is 
well equipped; indeed, other editions and versions might 
even be cUspensed with, Henry B. Fuller 



CORRESPONDENCE 

A WORD FROM MR. UNTERMEYER 

To the Editor: The few of us who have been worried 
about the sometimes monotonous heresies of Poetry's 
younger critics are grateful for the catholicity exhibited 
in your May number. The magazine threatens to become 
what it used to be: an adventure in excitement. Where 
else in one journal, I wonder, could one hope to find so 
scornful an attack on feminist poetry as Yvor Winters' 
querulous review of Anna Wickham's book, and so 

[i68] 



 



A Word from Mr. Untermeyer 

incongruous a defense of the jingle of chronic optimism 

as Gamaliel Bradford's laudation of "Eddie" Guest? 

Because of a personal thrust in the first review, I am 

appending an expostulation to these congratulatory 

sentences. Thus Mr. Winters, banning his review of 

The Contemplative ^arry: 

"The most casual reading — if such a thing were possible — of Mrs. 
Wickham's work reveals die strength of her candor, the intiense single- 
ness of her purpose," writes Mr. Untermeyer in an introduction that 
makes one admire the shrewdness of the gentlemen who chose him for 
his task. And, without wishing to disagree, the hesitant reader may be 
permitted to wonder what candor and purpose may have to do with art. 

The spectacle of an author championing his publishers 
is so rare that I take a double pleasure in asking Mr. 
A^nters, as courteously as possible, what secret agents 
led him to believe that Harcourt, Brace and Co. "chose" 
me to introduce Mrs. Wickham to the American public? 
The truth is exactly the opposite; for better or for worse, 
I "chose" them. For many years an enthusiastic reader 
of Mrs. Wickham's work as it appeared in England, I 
suggested and prepared a condensed edition of two of 
her books, offering, brashly and with malice prepense, 
to supply an appreciatory foreword which I had written 
for The New Republic. Mr! Winters, in all fairness, 
should attribute to the "gentlemen" who publish no 
more "shrewdness" than they actually possess. 

But my chief quarrel with your reviewer is based on 
his second sentence. Mr. Winters is a poet, and he is 
sensitive enough to know that art, like beauty, is not a 

thing but a relation. And yet he writes about it as 
dogmatically as though he were using a sacrosanct 
capital A, as if art were a static property or a fixed form 
which one could violate as easily as breaking a vase or 
dropping the fourteenth line of the sonnet. The term 
itself tends increasingly to such confused thought and 
cloudy writing that I would like to see an insurgent 
movement which had for one of its objects the elimina- 
tion from the language of certain words. I refer partic- 
ularly to the tag-ends of literary jargon which have be- 
become as full of contradictions and as empty of meaning 
as: Arty Beauty ^ Magic ^ Rhetoric ^ Design ^ Lyric ^ etc. Mr. 
Winters should remember, what he undoubtedly knows, 
that the desire to write definitely of definite things (if 
Mr. CabeU will pardon the realistic paraphrase) is as 
much a prbvince of "art" as the most subtle interweaving 
of nuance and overtone. And for such creation, " candor " 
and "purpose" are not wholly negligible. 

Louis Untermeyer 

Noie by the Editor: It is hardly necessary to remind Mr. Untermeyer 
that the editors are not responsible for opinions printed in our cor- 
respondence section. That is partly a protest department, and even 
Mr. Guest may find a defender there. 

Reviews are a different matter. If the editor were to permit only 
her own exact opinions to be expressed in reviews, she would needs 
write them all herself. In a general way she endeavors to print reviews 
which agree, on the whole, with the feeling and attitude toward the art 
which the magazine seeks to encourage. The reviewer's ardor may 
sometimes carry him too far, but to insist on meticulous modifications 
might destroy all ardor. 


Robert Bums Wilson 

ROBERT BURNS WILSON 

To the Editor: Many of my friends and myself were 
interested in the editorial in your southern number en- 
titled Poetry South. The treatment of southern literature 
seemed to center chiefly about the southeastern states, 
but as passing mention was made of certain Kentuckians, 
we wish to call your attention to the omission of the name 
of the poet-painter, Robert Burns Wilson. 

To any Kentuckian, it is almost anathema that our 
greatly beloved and distinguished poet should be missed 
from any discussion of southern letters; and I venture 
to say that in the coming revival of interest in southern 
literature, his name will be prominent. The contem- 
porary and friend of Madison Cawein, James Lane Allen, 
Henry Watterson, James Whitcomb Reilly, Richard 
Watson Gilder and a host of other American men of 
letters, there is hardly an event in the literary history of 
his time with which he was not connected. Few Americans 
who went through the Spanish-American War can forget 
his Remember the Mainey and To a Kentucky Cardinal the 
children of the South learn in their readers. In 1909 he 
received the Memorial Medal for his commemorative poem 
at the Poe Centenary held at the University of Virginia 
(his home state — he migrated to Kentucky); and his 
tribute to Robert £. Lee is immortal. In the cemetery 
at Frankfort his monument stands side by side with 
Daniel Boone's, overlooking the Elkhorne River, and his 
bust is in the State House. 

Wilson's name was familiar in the magazines and he 
left three books of verse: Life and Love^ The Shadows 
of the Trees and The Chant of a Woodland Spirit. Another 
book is to be published shortly. His daughter has once 
contributed to your magazine, I believe; her name b 
Anne Elizabeth Wilson. A Kentuckian 

NOTES 

Ceruin problems of editorial poliqr may perhaps be oonfided to our 
contributors and readers. Of late we have been informed of cases of 
disappointment and irritation due to our hdding accepted poems too 
long before publication. 

This impatience is hardly to be wondered at, but these poets might 
be still more disappointed if we should refuse their poems merely because 
we have no immediate room for them. The greatest editorial difficulty 
we encounter is the temptation to accept more poems than we are able 
to publish promptly. It seems an injustice to send back a good poem, 
but delay is the only possible alternative. We cannot enlarge the 
magazine, as each copy printed, being partly paid for by endowment, 
already costs more than its retail price; moreover, a monthly sheaf of 
verse should be discreedy small. 

Apparently there is but one thing to do — we must be less hospitable. 
The editors will be compelled hereafter to draw a more stringent line 
in the acceptance of poems. We have too much advance material on 
hand, but the' conquest of soft moods may enable us to begin our next 
volume in October with a cleaner slate. Hereafter we must try to keep 
the edge of resolution sharp, even at the risk of errors of exclusion. 

We deeply regret to announce the recent death, in Portland, Oregon, 
of Joseph Andrew Galahad, whose poem, ^ Mood^ appears in this 
number. 

For years this poet has fought gallantly his deadly enemy — tubercu- 
losis. In his last letter to the editor, written February 17th, he said: 

"Vm much better, and the old dragon has run away for a whole year, 


Notes 

the doctors tell me. Vm going to believe them this trip, and work as 
no one ever dreamed of working for that year." 

His was a heroic spirit, and his death means the loss of a friend whose 
letters were as warm and personal as a hand-clasp. His poems reflected 
the spirit of the man; one of the best of them, Argosy y which was first 
printed in the North American Review^ presented allegorically his own 
struggle for life and beauty. 

Of the poets represented this month, eight have appeared before in 
Poetry. These are, besides Mr. Galahad, Mr. Isidor Schneider and 
Mr. Raymond Holden, of New York; Miss Elizabeth Coatsworth, of 
Pasadena and many other places from China to Buffalo; Kathryn 
White Ryan (Mrs. Edward R.), of New York; Miss Mary Carolyn 
Da vies, author of Youth Riding and other books (MacmiUan Co.), 
whose present New York address will be gratefully received; Mr. David 
Morton, author of Ships in Harbor (G. P. Putnam's Sons); and Mr. John 
McClure, author of Airs and Ballads (Alfred A. KnopO- 

The others are new to our readers: 

Mr. Osbert Sitwell, author of Argonaut and Juggemauty is a well 
known young English poet, one of "the three Sitwells" — sister and two 
brothers^— who were first published by B. H. Blackwell, of Oxford, a few 
years ago. 

Mr. Alva N. Turner, who first appeared in Dr. Williams' mimeo- 
graphed magazine Contaet^ is now living in Mendota, Wis. Mr. Mere- 
dith Beyers lives mostly in Chicago; and Helen Russmann (Mrs. Felix 
R.) in one of its suburbs, Palos Park. Miss Athena McFadden, of 
Granville, N. Y., is finbhing her course at Smith College. 

Mr. Robert J. Roe, now living in Hohokus, N. J., "worked as line- 
man, factory hand, sailor and newspaper hack" before he was twenty, 
went to the Mexican border with New Jersey militia in 191 6, and the 
next year took up a claim in Arizona. Mr. Roe writes: 

" 4 Sailor's NoU-hook b an attempt to interpret the sailor in terms of 
his own choosing. 

"Michaelis Kerek was my shipmate on a four-masted schooner for a 
nine-months' trip in the South Pacific. He is Lettish by birth, but by 
profession he is an alien, a wandering man, at home everywhere and 
nowhere at ease; in short, a sailor. 

"He is unlettered but not uncultured. His poems were spoken to 
me without his understanding what they were, and without my realiza- 
tion at the time. They were pitched in a key that the sea knows, 
whispered to me at night in the lantern-lighted forecastle; confided to 
me on the forecastle head when I came to relieve him and he lingered 
a moment, loath to quit the comfort of a seat on the anchor windlass, 
the mysterious peace of the hushed water under the forefoot, and the 
aching lunge of the jib-boom at the stars. I set down what he told me 
in my journal, and months after my return, on rereading his phrases, I 
said to myself. This is the stuff of which poetry is made.* And I 
set myself to interpret it. 

"I may not have done justice to Michaelis. Surely, if you do not 
get the impression of a wistful soul longing beyond the possibilities of 
his intelligence (which is what we all are doing) I shall have failed; but 
at least I shall have the satisfaction of knowing that I have done my 
utmost."

PIANISSIMO 

An Intef7nc2zo 

For Bee KnuJsen 

^ # fFO elderly gentlemeity in clothes even older than them- 
-^ selveSy are just sitting down — with the outward aid of 
crooked canes and the inward support of sighs — on what is 
presumably a park bench^ shaded by mountain laurels y with 
a swan-pond for a background. The men also carry the 
venerable pipes of tradition: in this case, heavily crusted 
corn-cobs. Their speech, very slow and gentle, gives them the 
sound of impersonal instruments improvising a harmless duo: 
prosaic music blown into the air at the end of smoke spirals, 
the re-lighting of pipes necessarily frequent. The only 
apparent difference between them, traceable perhaps to the 
unconscious bias of habitual meditation and perpetual com-- 
parison of ideas, has reduced itself to a slight wagging of the 
head on the part of the one as opposed to a slight nodding on 

the part of the other. Speech and movement coincide almost 
as caressingly as the effect produced by lips brushing wood- 
instruments. 

Henry: Nay, but I insist 

that the quick sharp touches the rain 

and slower titillation the sun 

put upon those flowers we saw 

have in them the same heedless passion, 

heedless of all save the self, 

which envelops unconscious adolescence. 

That isn't the type of caress I'm seeking. 
Hodge: Those flowers were pale indeed 

with a suggestion of pink and beginning of blue! 
Henry: Early degrees of coloration 

solely indicative of the mood 

of self-interest of rain and of sun; 

alternately shaping something, 

like a left hand and right 

of one and the same conjurer 

reproducing his own vague image: 

the flower somehow a captive, 

clay just as we are, 

subject to the next modulation 

towards the next helpless state of being. 

I've had my share and enough 

of such no longer magical passes. 
Hodge: Nearer to red and closer to purple! 


 






Alfred Kreymborg 



Henry: That is the type of caress 

which has made of what I was 

the droning instrument I am, 

played upon in the one tonality 

of a careless self-love so long 

that the grave itself 

will simply be the final effort 

of the same somebody using me 

to express himself in a minor cadence — 

his little alas but a sigh 

that his composition closed so shabbily. 
Hodge: And still you cannot recall, 

stubborn lad that you are, 

a single variation, a dissonance, a brftve? 
Henry: Neither can you, Hodge, 

with your eye pointing forward! 
Hodge: Let us try just once more agsdn — 
Henry: Folk-song of the hopeful! — 
Hodge: And perhaps — 
Henry: Da capo of the hopeless! 
Hodge: Possibly the shade of this laurel, 

itself the design of accident, 

angle of sun and of tree 

meeting, rounding, spreading, 

will quiet your melancholy, 

and some quaint caress have room to stir, 

your memory mislaid? 
Henry: Memory is a cupboard 

[177I 




 

I have gone to myriad times 

and have returned the one time always 

with relics so tedious 

I find them heavier than boulders. 

Since you who persist must try once again, 

pray, take down the future if you can. 
Hodge: Let us then sit here and wait, 

and the strange, the new, may yet transpire. 
Henry: You nod your head and I wag mine, 

that is the difference between us: 

you have verticals left in you, 

I am all horizontal. 
Hodge: But we fire breathed into moving 

in accordance with the odd, 

delicately reciprocal nuance 

of our one and the same — 
Henry: Bassoonist! — 
Hodge: You dub him lugubriously! — 
Henry: Accurately! — 
Hodge: Henry! 

[Henry looks at Hodge. Hodge smiles. They smoke in 
silence. Hodge points with his pipe-stem.] 
Hodge: That swan, 

a white interrogation 

embracing the water, 

and being embraced in response — 
Henry: Their eyes reflecting each other, 

their bodies displacing — 


Alfred Kreymhcrg 

Hodge: That swallow cleaving the 8ur, 

trusting his wings to the waves of ether — 
Henry: And the wr trusting him 

with room in her body, 

relinquishing just enough space 

for him to fit himself into — 
Hodge: Or the worm underground, 

digging cylinder channels — 
Henry: And the earth undulating 

to the pressure of excavation — 
Hodge: Caresses like these, simple Henry — 
Henry: Caresses like those, simpler Hodge, 

have been clapped in my ear 

by your credulous tongue 

with such affectionate fortitude, 

Tm a bell attacked by echoes 

each time the sea moves. 

[Hodge looks at Henry and wags Us head. Henry nods, 
and smiles. Hodge turns away.] 

Henry: You also remind me of evergreens 

refusing to acknowledge the seasons, 
or unable to distinguish 
between white flowers and snow. 
You're as old and as young as romance. 

Hodge: It's you who fall redundant, 
you who fondle the rondo — 
why not have done and call me senile? 

[179I 




 

Henry: Senility is a sling 

invented by cynical youths 
who envy and would rob 
the old of their possessions. 

Hodge: You admit possessions? — 
you contradict yourself? — 

Henry: My property 

comprises the realization, 

stripped bare of hope or hypothesis, 

that I own neither things nor persons; 

least of all these, myself. 

Nor am I longer deluded 

with even the thought of touching 

a body that pirate youth would filch, 

who cannot rid his blood of desire. 

Hodge: Then you must be that youth, 
since you crave — 

Henry: A type of caress? 

Hodge: How do you wriggle out of that? 

[Hodge and Henry relight their pipes.] 

Henry: The type of caress I crave 
must have in it 
no desire to make of me 
aught of what it would make of itself. 
It must not say to me, 
"I would make of you 
more of me and less of you — " 

[i8o] 



 



Alfred Kreymborg 



Hodge: Nor must it lure me^ 

by virtue of the bounty 

of its body or the beauty 

of its mind, to sigh, 

^^I would make of myself 

more of you and less of me — ** 
Henry: I have had enough 

of such juxtaposition — 
Hodge: The immortal dialogue 

of life and of death — 
Henry: The recurrent symbol 

of being and reflection — 
Hodge: Of Narcissus 

in love with himself— 
Henry: Of God chanting a solo 

to comfort His loneliness, 

like an aged woman 

knitting things for her children to wear 

in her own image, 

singing: "This is I, 

and you are mine; 

so wear my love as I love you." 

[Pause. Henry lowers his head; so does Hodge.] 

Henry: If it is 

God who fashioned me, 

is it He 

who asks, is He pleased? 

Hodge: Does my prayer, 

which is His 

ifFmHis, 

move or leave Him unmoved? 
Henry: It is He 

who lifts these questions, 

or am I 

to blame for thinking? 
Hodge: If He, 

noticing me 

at last, notices Himself— 

what's wrong with Him? 
Henry: Really, 

Fm not r^etting 

what I am, 

nor be^ng, make me better. 
Hodge: If I 

have a sense of the droll, 

surely 

He has one too. 
Henry: Asking Himself 

to pray to Himself— 

that is, 

if He fashioned me? 

[Pause.] 

Hodge: Does it comfort you? 
Henry: A little — for a moment. 


Alfred Kreymborg 

Hodge: Farther than last time? 
Henry: A tiny stretch beyond. 

[They raise their heads.] 

Hodge: It*s still a wee mad melody — 
Henry: Innocent blasphemy 

of the inner 

frantic to grow to the outer, 

to the more than itself — 

the molecule a star, 

the instant universal — 

the me a trifle closer 

to the you that gave it life. 
Hodge: You recall how you composed it 

years before we came to this? 
Henry: As clearly as a brook, 

and you sitting in its midst 

like a pebble nodding assent 

to the foolish reckless sound — 
Hodge: Strange that we return to it! 
Henry: Stranger still, we do naught but return! 

[They continue smoking j Htnry wagging, Hodge nodding.] 

Hodge: Did you feel something stir? 
Henry: Only another breeze — 
Hodge: But didn't you see that cloud alter? — 
Henry: The cause of the breeze — 

Hodge: Caressing us? — 

Henry: Leaving me colder — 

Hodge: Me warmer. 

Henry: When the temperature in a room 

is higher or lower than normal, 

it is needful to open 

or to shut a window — 
Hodge: Which? 
Henry: A west wind 

urges me to shut a west window, 

an east an east — that is all. 

And I have known the same touch 

to thrill and leave me cold, 

and this monotonous heart of mine 

to open and close in childish acquiescence 
Hodge: Button your coat about you — 
Henry: We have no business 

gadding around in the spring — 

it was you who suggested it, 

you with your nodding. 
Hodge: It was the look of the world outdoors — 

let us try another place, 

or wander back home again. 
Henry: And try just once more? 
Hodge: Perhaps, providing — 
Henry: We are like twin philosophers, 

phrase-practitioners 

who argue with slender 


Alfred Kreymborg 

tapering sensitive beards 

which each lays persuasive hold of, 

pulling first the one the other 

and the other the one in turn, 

till their heads collide and rebound 

back to the starting-point, 

with if or suppose or providing or but — 
Hodge: But you have more msdom? — 
Henry: And you more happiness! 

And thus the moon pursues the sun! 

[Hodge touches Henry. \ 

Hodge: Are you angry? 
Henry: Angry with you? 

[They eye each other^ smile faintly y and turn away,] 

Henry: Your talk comes to me from afar, 

though you are only an elbow away; 

like rain making an arid soil 

intimate with better things. 

They, perhaps, are what are left me. 
Hodge: If I say, I love thee, 

in some guise or other — 

this is more than talk? 
Henry: The gesture of a lonely spirit 

reaching out to a lonelier. 

[They methodically shake out their pipes and stuff them 

away, Hodge nudges Henry ever so gently. Henry tries to 
rise. Hodge has to aid him. They move away haltingly^ 
Hodge* s stick tapping a little in advance of Henry* Sy and 
Hodge* s arm through Henry's. Henry tries to shake off 
Hodge y but the latter persists. They move slightly faster^ 

Henry: Was it yesterday I said — 
Hodge: What, Henry? 
Henry: I love thee? 
Hodge: In actual words, nay — 

but the day before — 
Henry: Then let them have been said 

yesterday as well, 

for if words ever fail me — 
Hodge: They never fail you. 
Henry: Nor you, Hodge. 

[They nod together.] 

Henry: Let us go silently 

the next pace or two — 
Hodge: As you will — 
Henry: And let other things speak — 
Hodge: For us? 
Henry: For themselves. 

[They disappeoTy Hodge* s stick still sounding in advance 
of Henry* s\

IN THE DARK CITY 

There is a harper plays 

Through the long watches of the lonely night 

When, like a cemetery, 

Sleepathe dark city, with her millions laid each in his tomb. 

I feel it in my dream; but when I wake. 

Suddenly, like some secret thing not to be overheard. 

It ceases — 

And the gray night grows dumb. 

Only in memory 
Linger those veiled adagios, fading, fading • • . 
Till, with the morning, they are lost. 

What door was opened then? 

What worlds undreamed of lie around us in our sleep. 

That yet we may not know? 

Where is it one sat playing 

Over and over, with such high and dreadful peace. 

The passion and sorrow of the eternal doom? 

John Hall Wheelock 


NOTES OF TRAVEL 



ON THE TRAIN 



The lady in front of me in the car, 

WixHi little red coils close over her ears, 

Is talking witli her friend; 

And the circle of ostrich foam around her hat. 

Curving over like a wave. 

Trembles with her little windy words. 

What is she saying, I wonder, 

That her feathers should tremble 

And the soft far of her coat should slip down over her 

shoulders? 
Has her string of pearls been stolen. 
Or maybe her husband? 

II 

He is drunk, that man — 

Drunk as a lord, a lord of the bibulous past. 

He shouts wittily from his end of the car to the man in the 

comer; 
He bows to me with chivalrous apologies. 
He philosophizes, plays with the wisdom of the ages. 
Flings off his rags. 
Displays his naked soul — 
Athletic, beautifal, grotesque. 


Harriet Monroe 



In the good time coming. 

When men drink no more, 

Shall we never see a nude soul dancing 

Stript and free 

In the temple of his god? 

Ill 

She comes smiling into the car 

With iridescent bubbles of children. 

She blooms in the close plush seats 

Like a narcissus in a bowl of stones. 

She croons to a baby in her lap — 

The trees come swinging by to listen. 

And the electric lights in the ceiling are stars. 



AT O NEILL S POINT 

Grand Canyon of Arizona 

Cardeflas, I salute you! 

You, marauding buccaneering Spaniard! 

You, ragged and sworded lordling, slashing through to the 

Seven Cities of Cibola; 
You, athirst in the desert, seeking to drink from the great 

river — 
The mother of western seas, dear to your Hopi guides! 
You, Cardeflas the Spaniard, three centuries before the 

next first white man, 

You with your handful of starvelings stood on this Rim 

of the Canyon, 
And looked down at flecks of water in the deeps, 
Like yellow petals fallen. 
You scrambled a few hundred feet down the sheer rock 

wall, 
And knew you would never drink of that tawny torrent. 
You gave it up, and thirsted, and cursed your guides. 

And your leader, Coronado the adventurer. 
Thought you mad when you told your story — 
Mad of thirst in the desert. 
Dreaming of loud deep rivers 
In demon-haunted caverns. 

But I believe you. 

Here where I stand you stood — 

On the rim of the world. 

You saw these sky-wrapt towers. 

These terraced purple temples august and terrible. 

And over them — over — 

You gazed at the Celestial City, 

And counted the steps of gods on its ramparts. 

And saw the Great White Throne, all pearl and moonstone. 

Beyond, through the turquoise gates. 




Harriet Monroe 



IN THE YELLOWSTONE 



Little pin-prick geysers, spitting and sputtering; 

Little foaming geysers, that spatter and cough; 

Bubbling geysers, that gurgle out of the calyx of morning- 
glory pools; 
'Laughing geysers, that dance in the sun, and spread their 
robes like lace over the rocks; 

Raging geysers, that rush out of hell with a great noise, 
and blurt out vast dragon-gulps of steam, and, 
finishing, sink back wearily into darkness; 

Glad geysers, nymphs of the sun, that rise, slim and nude, 
out of the hot dark earth, and stand poised in 
beauty a moment, veiling their brows and breasts 
in mist; 

Winged geysers, spirits of fire, that rise tall and straight 
like a sequoia, and plume the sky with foam: 

O wild choral fountains, forever singing and seething, 
forever boiling in deep places and leaping forth for 
bright moments into the air. 

How do you like it up here? Why must you go back to 
the spirits of darkness? What do you tell them 
down there about your little glorious life in the sun? 



UTAH 



It was a queer country your harsh Lord gave you. 
Great Brigham, whom I see coated and curled 

In bronze before me in the public square! 

It was a scraped and shining skeleton, 

Gnawed to the bone long since at God's first breakfast 

And thrown away to bleach out in the sun. 

Yet here He led you — 

The Lord and his vicegerent Joseph Smith — 

He ordered you 

To take the dead earth from His niggard hand 

And set His Throne up by the salty sea — 

The little bucketful of ocean, poured 

Over the desert's feet between the hills. 

And so you starved and prayed, 

Thirsted and starved and prayed through the lean years, 

Keeping the faith, digging your little ditches. 

Making the desert blossom as the rose. 

You married many wives. 

And got you many children to fulfil 

The special order whispered in the night 

To His apostle by the Lord Himself— 

The God of Abraham, of Saul and David, 

Of Solomon and other lustful kings. 

And here, tithe upon tithe, stone upon stone. 
Your saints built up His throne unto the Lord 
From plans the angel taught your hand to draw: 
His new Solomon's Temple, heaven-remembered. 
To rise again here at the western gate. 
And prove His glory in these latter days! 


Harriet Monroe 



Great Brighaniy sleeping now under the desert 
With all your wives. 

What summary vengeance have you meted out 
To that ironic angel? 

He alone builds 
Who builds for beauty ^ shrining his little truth 
In stones that make it fair. 



IN HIGH PLACES 

My mountains, God has company in heaven — 

Crowned saints who sing to him the sun-long day. 

He has no need of speech with you — with you, 

Dust of his foot-stool! No, but I have need. 

Oh, speak to me, for you are mine as well — 

Drift of my soul. I built you long ago; 

I reared your granite masonry to make 

My house of peace, and spread your flowered carpets. 

And set your blue-tiled roof, and in your courts 

Made musical fountains play. Ah, give me now 

Shelter and sustenance and liberty. 

That I may mount your sky-assailing towers 

And hear the winds communing, and give heed 

To the large march of stars, and enter in 

The spirit-crowded courts of solitude. 

Harriet Monroe 

THE WHITE MOTH 

Every night 
At my windy, when 

I quench the light 
Between nine an' ten, 

A White Moth 

Soars through the trees, 
Light as the froth 

Blown off of the seas. 

At the same time 
It flutters, white 

In the scented lime — 
Every night. 

Seems-like it is. 
When I draw the blind, 

As if the hair riz 
Straight off me mind. 

For, how do it come 
Just to the minute? — 

As if it heard some 
Clock strikin' in it. 

Seems like the spell 
Of some Mighty One, 

Come for to tell 
Of some thing I done! 


Rosamond LangMJge 

Seems like a sign 

I done him some hurt, 
When I whipped from his line 

Quilty's white shirt. 

Me heart wouldn't crack — 

But the spell would break 
If I took it back 

As a little mistake. 

Still . . . Fm no debtor 

To a bit of light froth: 
Maybe 'twould be better 

To crush the White Moth! 

THE GENTLE HOUSEWIFE 

There's the first white butterfly dancing abroad! 
There are wild wind-flowers dotting the sward; 
There are wild green breakers combing the bay; 
There's a red ferret darting over the way! 

But I am chiding the children for being so wild; 
I am chiding the nurse for chiding the child; 
I am careful to lay down tea-leaves in the hall; 
I am gazing at that spot of mildew on the wall — 
And my heart is breaking, breaking, 
With the hatred of it alll 

Rosamond Langbridge 

FULL OF LAUGHTER 

Very fall of laughter is the old man. 

The air is fall of wings 

Of the little birds of laughter. 

Which the old man flings 

From his mouth up to the rafter 

In the white-washed ceiling 

That vibrates with his laughter 

And quivers and sings; 

Till the little birds come stealing 

To the lips whence they came, 

And you only hear the laughter 

In the shaking of the flame, 

In the tapping of the leaves. 

And you only hear the laughter 

Very faintly if at all; 

Until, as you drowse, suddenly, once more. 

He awakes with a roar, 

And the laughter goes flapping from the ceiling to the wall. 

Very fall of laughter is the old man. 

Very full of laughter is the old man? . . . 

I know not what I say, 

I mistrust what I hear. 

There's an evil tongue licking where the log-fires play. 

The round cat heaves with a laughter and a fear. 

There are wells lying deeper 


Louis Golding 

Than the laughter in his eyes. 

There are glooms lying deeper 

Than the lost lands of the sleeper, 

There are sounds behind the laughter 

Which I dare not follow after, 

There's a choked heart tolling and a dumb child cries. 

There's an old mouth full of laughter, 

But a dumb heart cries. 

Louis Golding 

SYNCRASY 

I am a reed 

Wind-throated and rain-tuned. 
You are the player, 
VWse as the world. 

What will you blow through me, Softmouth? 

What sorrows must I echo 

From your honied lips 

To learn the sweetness of pain? 

What lachrymations must I silver 

To learn the bitterness of love? 

I am a reed 
Waiting and silent. 
You are the player. 
Searching your heart. 

A, A. Rosenthal 

KING ALFRED AND THE PEASANT WOMAN 

Throw me from the house — did he? 
Well, to new chivalry that is no great thing! 
I am my father's daughter, lady! 
And he*s a pretty figure in the ring. 

But my man, my master, there he sat a-dreaming 
While all the house might burn and he'd not sorrow; 
Nor had I any warrant that his scheming 
Would bring us any victory on the morrow. 

And I spoke to him! Oh, I informed him! 
He'd be a dead man if he were not stung; 
Could any man keep hands down, and me lashing? 
Friend, you insult my tongue! 

I'd rather he fought me than missed his combats. 
Though I'm not built for blows upon the heart. 
Give me a breast-plate, and I'll at 'em. 
Though that's fool-woman's part! 

I love him; and when he comes back with honor 
After the fight I drove him to is won, 
He'll find his woman with her glory on her. 
Please God, the child's a son! 




Anna Wickham 

A POET ADVISES A CHANGE OF CLOTHES 

Why wears my lady a trailing gown, 

And the spurious gleam of a stage queen's crown? 

Let her leap to a horse, and be off to the down! 

Astride, let her ride 

For the sake of my pride. 

That she is more ancient than Diana — 

Ancient as that she-ape who, lurking among trees, 

Dropt on a grazing zebra, gript him with her knees 

And was off across the breadths of the savannah; 

Barking her primal merry deviltry. 

Barking in forecast of her son's sovereignty. 

My timeless lady is as old as she. 

And she is moderner moreover 

Than Broadway, or an airship, or than Paris lingerie. 

O my eternal dominating dear. 

How much less dated thou than Guinevere! 

Then for your living lover 

Change your gown, 

And don your queenship when you doff your crown. 

Anna Wickham 



PREDICTION 

In some inimical starry night 
When the worthies are abed, 
Suddenly will come a flight 
Of baleful things about your head. 
These will not be simply bats 
(These, imponderable as leaves). 
These will not be timid gnats — 
These will be audacious thieves: 

Devils of the midnight's action. 
Wrong ones of the twisted spheres, 
A fluttering unholy faction 
Of Port Havoc mutineers. 

In your spirit's corridors 
There will, that night, be strange things: 
What were dances will be wars, 
There will be vain imaginings — 
Slaughter and knavery and laughter, 
Sights to make a man afraid. 
Boozing, cajoling, boasts^ and after 
(I need not say) you'll be betrayed. . . . 

Since the story is so bitter 
The quaint world will find its proofs — 
What is left of you will flitter 
Like a grey cat on the roofs. 

Morris Gilberi 


IN RUSSIA 

THE SPILLING OF THE WINE 

The soldiers lie upon the snow. 

That no longer gyrates under the spinning lights 

Night juries in her fat black hands. 

They will not babble any more secrets to loose-mouthed 

nights 
Expanding in golden auras, 
While sleigh-bells jingle like new coins the darkness 

shuffles ... 
They will not drink any more wine — 
V^ne of the Romanoffs, 
Jewelled wine 

The secret years worked slowly at 
Till it was wrought to fire, 
As stones are faceted 
Until they give out light. 
The soldiers lie very still. 
Their shadows have shrunk up close 
As toads shrink under a stone; 
And night and silence, 
The ancient cronies, 
Foregather above them. 

But still over the snow, that is white as a ram's fleece. 
Arms swing like scythes . . • 

[20I] 




 

And shadows in austere lines 

Sway in a monstrous and mysterious ritual — 

Shadows of the Kronstad sailors 

Pouring blood and wine. . . 

Wine 

Spurting out of flagons in a spray of amethyst and gold. 

Creeping in purple sluices; 

Wine 

And blood in thin bright streams 

Besprinkling the immaculate snow; 

Blood, high-powered with the heat of old vineyards. 

Boring . . . into the cool snow ... 

Blood and wine 

Mingling in bright pools 

That suck at the lights of Petrograd 

As dying eyes 

Suck in their last sunset. 

The night has a rare savor. 

Out of the snow-piles — altar-high and colored as by a 

rosy sacrifice — 
Scented vapor 

Ascends in a pale incense . . . 
Faint astringent perfume 
Of blood and wine. 




Lola Ridge 



SNOW DANCE FOR THE DEAD 



Dance, little children ... it is holy twilight . . . 
Have you hung paper flowers about the necks of the ikons ? 
Dance soft . . . but very gaily ... on tip-toes like the 

snow. 
Spread your little pinafores 
And courtesy as the snow does . . . 
The snow that bends this way and that 
In silent salutation. 

Do not wait to warm your hands about the fires. 
Do not mind the rough licking of the wind. 
Dance forth into the shaggy night that shakes itself upon 

you. 

Dance beneath the Kremlin towers — golden 

In the royal 

Purple of the sky — 

But not there where the light is strongest . . . 

Bright hair is dazzling in the light. 

Dance in the dim violet places 

Where the snow throws out a faint lustre 

Like the lustre of dead faces . . . 

Snow downier than wild-geese feathers . . . 

Enough filling for five hundred pillows . . . 

By the long deep trench of theMead. 

Bend, little children, 

To the rhythm of the snow 

That undulates this way and that 

In silver spirals. 

Cup your hands like tiny chalices . . . 

Let the flakes fill up the rosy 

Hollows of your palms 

And alight upon your hair, 

Like kisses that ding softly 

A moment and let go . . . 

Like many kisses falling altogether . . . 

Quick . . . cool kisses. 



THE WHITE BIRD 

Man of the flame-eyes 

And mouth with the bitter twist of in-grown laughter, 

And little bald man . . . whose seeming stillness 

Is akin to the velocity of a spinning star 

Holding its perfect poise — 

You two yea-sayers 

Beetling over the little deniers. 

Two great levelers, building from the earth up, among 

puttiers and pluggers of rotten piles — 
You of the rich life, running in ample measure, amidst 

life deleted of its old raw fire as earth b deleted 

of its coal and iron — 
You be mighty hunters and keepers, 
Trotsky and Lenine — 


Lola Ridge 

Yet can you hold . . . the unconstrainable One 
Of the slow and flaming deaths 
And multiple resurrections? 

Hands, reaching in hundreds of millions, 

Backs, straightening under the keeling floor of the world, 

Can you hold the great white bird? — 

She that sweeps low over the chain-gangs 

When they glance up from their stone-breaking 

Into morning's burning gold; 

She that goes down into underground cells. 

Sending the cool wind of her wings 

Through unsevering stone . . . 

And departs, unbeknown, from those who announce her. 

Saying : " Lo, she is ours !" 

Ah, what a mighty destiny shall be yours. 

Should you persuade her — 

The Unconstrainable One 

Who has slid out of the arms of so many lovers. 

Leaving not a feather in their hands! 

Lola Ridge

COMMENT 

SHELLEY 

IN these days of revolutionary changes it is appropriate 
to be reminded of Shelley by the centenary of his 
death; and the reminder may well lead us to a deeper 
study of the man and his work than a casual reading of 
The Cloud and The Skylark. For of all the ranking 
English poets, Shelley was preeminently the poet with 
a message — a type somewhat decried by modern esthetic 
theorists, who would not permit the muse to stiffen her 
lips with didactic emphasis. Even Milton, the Puritan 
partisan of Cromwell, pleader for free speech, free thought, 
free divorce and other heresies, was a conservative con- 
formist beside Shelley, whose stark idealism accepted no 
compromise, whose ardor for a complete revolution in 
human society would have been, like Lenin's, " the same 
in act as in desire" if he also could have faced the tragic 
. ironies of fate by achieving political power. 

Of course we have only the beginning of Shelley's think- 
ing, for he was under thirty, and young for his age, when 
he died. Yet there is a kind of finality about it, for he 
seems youth incarnate, youth immortal, and perhaps, as 
with the great mystics among whom Mr. Yeats classes 
him, old age with him would have been but a diviner 
childhood. Aflame with reformatory zeal, he theorized 
with complete conviction; and his theoretic picture of a 
perfect world was as untroubled by common sense as a 


Shelley 

cubistic painting, and as unaffected by the humane 
perspectives of humor. He had youth's singlemindedness, 
single-sigh tedness; perceiving a vivid truth, he struck out 
toward it through all obstacles, no matter how many 
conventions, laws, or even human hearts were broken on 
the way; only to be deflected from the immediate goal by 
the more flaming ardor of a newer revelation. 

His creed was essentially Godwin touched by emotion, 
eighteenth-century radicalism transfigured by a poet's 
dreams. Freedom, sacrosanct and glorified, 'was its 
cardinal principle: evil is an accident; could man always 
have been free he would never have wandered from 
virtue — "government is but the badge of his degrada- 
tion." Lift from his past history the incubus of the law, 
with its consequences of obedience, "fear, faith and 
slavery"; grant him through all his course freedom of 
thought, of action and of love, and man's career would 
have been one long millennium of universal justice. And 
now this long-delayed peace on earth must be invoked on 
the instant by chosen souls. Live out your life, fulfil all 
natural impulses so long as your heart is pure, restrain 
neither thought nor deed, and "neither change nor falter 
nor repent" — such was the counsel of perfection which his 
impulsive "practicalness" urged upon his puny neighbors 
and flaunted brightly in the face of the canting world. 
He had no time to wait or think. If his intellect built too 
slowly, his imagination lightly overleapt logic and perched 
upon cloudy ramparts for a sunrise song. 

The lyrics by which he is chiefly remembered were mere 
tangents from the rounding circle of his message — he 
would rather have destroyed them, probably, than let his 
fame rest upon such slight sparks of personal emotion, 
such flashes of joy or love or despair, thrown oflF casually 
while, from ^een Mab to The Triumph of Life^ he was 
summoning to action the hosts of a happier world. The 
language of his summons was clear. In The Masque of 
Anarchy and certain more directly political poems of 
anathema his faith in the power of the human soul utters 
a command to the proletariat of his time: 

Rise, like lions after slumber, 
In unvanquishable number! 
Shake your chains to earth like dew 
Which in sleep had fallen on you. 
Ye are many — they are few. 

In Prometheus Unbound this faith becomes an assertion of 
man's ultimate supremacy, when **the painted veil . . . 
called life ... is torn aside": 

The man remains — 
Sceptreless, free, uncircumscribed, but man: 
Equal, unclassed, tribeless and nationless; 
Exempt from awe, worship, degree; the king 
Over himself; just, gentle, wise — but man. 
Passionless? — no; yet free from guilt or pain, 
Which were, for his will made or suffered them; 
Nor yet exempt, though ruling them like slaves. 
From chance and death and mutability — 
The clogs of that which yet might oversoar 
The loftiest star of unascended heaven. 
Pinnacled dim in the intense inane. 


Shelley 

With a zealot's precision Shelley demanded the absolute. 
His was a religious spirit^ always fascinated by the super- 
natural, seeking communion with an impalpable divine 
essence. Therefore, in spite of the buffetings of fate, 
he stands for the revelation to men of ineffable spiritual 
realities beyond the reach of sensuous experience. His 
soul flamed upward like Blake's, though with less detach- 
ment. He explored the empyrean, he touched the 
intangible; his poetry brought down to earth the vision 
of supernal beauty which had eluded even the blind 
eyes of Milton. Through him the vitality of mystical 
abstractions, the power and sweep of subtle unseen 
forces, the loveliness of secret beauty, the glory of naked 
truth, and the upward reach of the human mind 
toward the infinite splendor, are given the fiery proof of 
song. On earth he was ill at ease; in the highest heaven 
of imagination his poise was perfect. He never wavered 
in his flight, never stooped to catch the popular ear, never 
d^aded for the sake of transient rewards a mission which 
seemed to him the holiest of all confided to mortal man. 
For poetry he held to be the noblest and most universal 
of the arts by which truth is made manifest to men, 
language being "as a mirror which reflects," and the 
materials of other arts "as a cloud which enfeebles, the 
light of which both are mediums." 

One is tempted to quote whole pages of his magnificent 
Defence of Poetry in this connection, an essay which makes 
a royal progress through the universe, and shows that the 


spirit of poetry is the manifestation of the eternal order 
and harmony, the vitalizing and regenerating principle, 
the exemplar of wisdom and the revealer of love, the soul 
of aspiration, "'the echo of the eternal music"; the 
destroyer, too, of wrong — a "sword of lightning, ever un- 
sheathed, which consumes the scabbard that would 
contain it." As an art, "poetry redeems from decay the 
visitations of the divinity in man," being " the record of 
the best and happiest moments of the happiest and best 
minds." He defends these happiest and best minds, who 
"make immortal all that is best and most beautiful in the 
world," from the charges the world has brought against 
their lives; insisting that their frailties are merely the 
rebound of what is animal and passionate in their nature 
from a spiritual exaltation they experience and express 
but do not understand. 

Poets are the hierophants of an unapprehended inspiration; the 
mirrors of the gigantic shadows which futurity casts upon the present; 
... the trumpets which sing to battle and feel not what they inspire; 
the influence which is moved not, but moves. Poets are the unacknowl- 
edged legislators of the world. 

He at least would be true to his high office. He would 
illumine a path for men's hopes to travel even though they 
mocked him. The glorious vision of an exalted destiny 
for his race was before him, and in the fit disclosure of that 
vision he felt secure of immortal influence, even though 
the world rejected him in life. And the world did reject 
him. He threw down the gauntlet and his country took

Shelley 

it up. His name was the synonym for unspeakable 
crimes, his poems were a target for the wrath and ridicule 
of reviewers, their small editions lay unsold with his 
publisher, and his sympathetic readers could be counted 
on the fingers of one hand. It was long after his death 
that the song of "the nightingale who sat in darkness" 
began to penetrate to men's ears. 

For in form, as well as in feeling, Shelley was a 
revolutionist, and therefore unwelcome. English poetry 
was but newly awake from its eighteenth-century trance. 
Coleridge, Bums and the quiet Wordsworth had brushed 
away forever those reams of rhymed eloquence with which 
Pope and his kind had smothered the goddess; but the 
world was as yet scarcely aware of it, preferring the old 
heroics. Though Byron was forcing down its throat his 
modern message, Shelley and Keats were still exotics — 
outlandish birds singing a wild strain. Perhaps Shelley 
himself scarcely realized how diflFerent his style was from 
all that had been so long in vogue. Like every true poet, 
he had an instinct for form; and it was probably by 
instinct, rather than deliberate intention, that he followed 
Coleridge in breaking the long reign of the iambic measure, 
that he played with anapaests and trochees, and surpassed 
in delicate complexity of rhythm even the gay Eliza- 
bethans. For the expression of modern subtleties he 
added more strings to their instrument, and passed it on 
to us enriched with new notes and capable of a broader 
range. 

Beauty, love and freedom are the triune chord at the 
basis of Shelley's song. We hear it agdn and again, like 
the Holy Grail motive in Parsifal. Prometheus Unbound 
is the spirit of freedom, braving omnipotent tyranny for 
love of the human race, who still declares, after aeons of 
agony: 

I would fain 
Be what it is my destiny to be. 
The savior and the strength of suffering man, 
Or sink into the original gulf of things — 

and at whose release and reunion with Nature, when 
Eternity has conquered the evil principle of Power, all 
earth and her children rejoice in the ecstasy of inextin- 
guishable love and holiness and peace. Shelley is at home 
in the heaven of heavens; the Prometheus soars like livid 
flame, and its choruses reach a celestial height of lyric 
exaltation. Whether spirits or echoes or furies speak, 
they speak with eternity behind and before them, reveal 
to us birthless and deathless minds. 

Prometheus and Adonais and the lyrics are the best of 
SheUey ; for in most of the longer poems, as even occasion- 
ally in these, he does not escape grandiloquence. With 
Coleridge and Burns and Keats he restored the lost 
Elizabethan tradition, resumed the grand manner, even 
though his one deliberately Elizabethan experiment was a 
failure. It is curious that this radical could not carry his 
radicalism into the theatre. The Cenci is an imitative 
dramatic essay rather than a drama, an experiment in the 
Elizabethan manner modified by classic austerities. It 


SheUey 

out-Wcbsters Webster in horrors, but misses Webster's 
vitality; its characters are premeditated types rather than 
suffering men and women. 

Shelley met the world of men and women with the 
solemn, unquestioning belief of some flower or child, 
and when things proved not what they seemed he thought 
they must be the exact reverse. The strength of the recoil 
was the natural result of the violent eagerness of the 
attack, and it was all a part of his passionate youthfulness. 
For not only the glories of youth but its weaknesses were 
his — its irreverence, its fiery impatience, its haughty 
intolerance of the work-a-day world, its reckless daring in 
the first onset flagging under prolonged effort. Thus it is 
by his upward reach more than his capacity for sustained 
flight that Shelley wins his place among the masters. 
For this reason his lyrics are the most typical expression 
of his genius. These are the record of his vdent emotion- 
alism; each one comes fresh from a burning mood. There 
b no time for inconstancy, for the dulling of the fine edge 
of inspiration, such as makes even the Prometheus 
strongest in its first act, a thing which can not be said of 
a faultless work of art. 

If he had lived to be old the record might be different. 
But as yet his thinking had not passed through youth's 
sense of dissonance and unreality. When he died he was 
still aloof from life: '"As to real flesh and blood," he said, 
"you know I do not deal in those articles;" and he called 
himself "the knight of the shield of shadow and the lance 

of gossamere." Humanity disappointed him, and even 
the momentary joy of dreams brought despair in its wake. 
It was because of the very ardor of his ecstasies that life 
was for Shelley a series of disillusions. One after another 
the raptures of his youth went out, and his path grew 
darker and more lonely to the end. He died at a crucial 
point in his development, when everything seemed to be 
falling away from him, when the stru^le with despond- 
ency was tempting him to suicide, "that golden key to 
the chamber of perpetual rest." If he had lived longer he 
must either have withdrawn more and more from actual- 
ities or have emerged into a more mature and humane 
wisdom. 

But we need not quarrel with his fate, or lament that 
his eager, restless, baffled spirit found swift repose in 
death. Life could scarcely have satisfied him — in the 
very exaltation of his purpose lay its doom. As it is, we 
may recognize in him the spirit of immortal youth, who 
had scarcely time to cry, "Then what is life?" before fate 
sealed his lips. In Adonais he prophetically praises death 
as if for his own burial, but in that last moment of the 
storm on the Gulf of Spezia he might have sung a still 
grander song. For he was glad to die. He was one of 

... the sacred few who could not tame 
Their spirits to the conqueror, but as soon 
As they had touched the world with living flame 
Fled back like eagles to their native noon.

A New Pulitzer Prize 

A NEW PULITZER PRIZE 

The award of a Pulitzer Prize of one thousand dollars 
to the Collected Poems of Edwin Arlington Robinson is 
a most agreeable surprise, as this is the first Pulitzer 
Prize ever granted to a poet. 

Four years ago, when the Poetry Society of America 
gave its first annual five hundred dollars to Sara Teas- 
dale's Love SongSy the award, being made in conjunction 
with the Pulitzer prizes, was falsely attributed to the 
same origin. An editorial in Poetry for August, 191 8, 
called attention, as follows, to the omission of poetry 
from the will: 

Mr. Pulitzer's will, creating a school of journalism at Columbia 
Univeruty, with annual thousand-dollar prizes for a novel, an editorial, 
a book of science, etc., omitted poetry. Probably he never thought 
of ib— nobody was thinking of poetry during the period when his will 
was drawn. Of course the omission of poetry from any prize-list which 
included at least two literary products, the novel and the play, was 
preposterous; and we may hope that the present donor, or other donors, 
may permanently atone for the slight with an annual prize as large as 
the other prizes. 

The poem of each year — or book of poems — ^must be, we submit, 
at least as prize-worthy as the editorial of the year. It may be, of 
course, of a value immeasurably greater, for, by the favor of the gods, 
it may be a masterpiece, an enduring work of genius — a distinction 
which could scarcely be claimed for any editorial. 

When this year's awards were announced, with Mr. 
Robinson's book among them, the editor wrote to Colum- 
bia University a letter inquiring about the improved 
status of poets; and received the following answer: 

To the Editor: • In reply to your letter of May 24th I beg to say that 
the poetry prize to which you refer was established by the Advisory 
Board of the School of Journalism at their meeting in May, 1921, at 
which meeting it was on motion unanimously 

"Resohed, That a prize of One thousand dollars be established for 
the best volume of verse published during the year by an American 
author." 

The Board at the same time discontinued another prize for which 
there had been no competition, which action set free sufficient funds 
to establish the poetry prize. Frank D. Fackenihal 

The initial award is of course worthy of all praise, 
though the committee may have regretted that they 
could not honor also Miss Millay's Second April. Indeed, 
the year 1921, presenting two such books, was singularly 
rich. The three members of the poetry jury were Wilbur 
L. Cross, Richard Burton and Ferris Greenslet. Though 
we cannot criticize the verdict in this case, we must 
repeat once more our plea that all juries should be strictly 
professional, and that poets alone have the right and the 
authority to award honors in their art. H. M. 

REVIEWS 

CARLOS WILLIAMS* NEW BOOK 

Sour GrapeSy by William Carlos Williams. Four Seas Co. 
This is, I believe, the fourth book that Dr. Williams has 
published. The Tempers^ which came first, was a bit thin, 
but contained two fine poems of their sort. Next came 
Al ^ue ^uiere, a hard-bitten book that attempted to 
create poetry out of urban modernity. Sour Grapes 

 



 



Carlos fViUiatns* New Book 

develops, more or less, the manner of Al ^ue ^uiere, and 
probably contains a greater number of successful poems. 
In between these two came Kora in Hell, a mass of prose 
fragments of Flaubertian precision, that as a whole got 
nowhere. 

Dr. Williams has a considerable leaning toward the 
'"conceit," and some of his finest poems are examples of 
it, although at other times he drags this structure in by 
the heels. By "conceit" I mean an intellectual relation- 
ship between two objects physically unrelated, one of 
which fuses with the sound and takes on an image 
existence. For example, the poem called To fFaken an 
Old Lady: 

Old age is 

a flight of small 

cheeping birds 

skimming 

bare trees 

above a snow glaze. 

Gaining and failing, 

they are buffeted 

by a dark wind. 

But what? 

On harsh weedstalks 

the flock has rested, 

the snow 

IS covered with broken 

seedhusks, 

and the wind tempered 

by a shrill 

piping of plenty. 

Such poems as this and Tlu NightingaleSy as the Love 
Song in Al^ue ^uiere beginning "Sweep the house dean," 
are as perfect and as final as Herrick; they make a reviewer 
feel ridiculous. But in A Celebration the method is 
worked to death — perhaps because it was a bit tired 
before it got under way and then had a long way to go; 
and in Primrose the conceit is superfluous. If we had 
been given the images without the explanatory yellow, 
they would have hit harder. 

In such poems as The Widofxfs Lament in Sprinpimey 
however, one finds the simple physical image — the image 
without ulterior "meaning" or even metaphor — ^used with 
great power: 

Today my son told me 

that in the meadows, 

at the edge of the heavy woods 

in the distance, he saw 

trees of white flowers. 

I feel that I would like 

to go there 

and fall into those flowers 

and sink into the marsh near them. 

Dr. Williams concerns himself with certain phases of 
American life, which he seems to feel acutely; and up to 
date he is not the dupe of his material. That is, he knows 
that stenographic reports of snowbirds or hawthorns do 
not suflice, even when smeared with pretty language. He 
looks for relations and the sharpest way to get them 
down. 

Despite all Dr. Williams' passion to the contrary, he is 
greatly influenced by his contemporaries and predecessors 


Carlos JViUiams^ New Book 

— by which I do not mean to condemn him, but simply to 
indicate that he, like any good writer, is inextricably 
caught in Mr. Eliot's "'tradition." His prose is obviously 
of the school of Flaubert, and his verse has gone through 
various influences. The poems in this book have, for the 
most part, worked away from the earlier jagged bitterness, 
into a certain serenity of manner that one associates with 
Mr. Pound's Chinese translations — a manner that Mr. 
Pound (among others) has used consciously and success- 
fully. How conscious Dr. Williams' use of it may be, I do 
not know; but if it is used unconsciously, it may be 
dangerous — the poet may cease to be able to see his 
material through the sticky haze of his manner. Anyway 
one has a right to wonder, when so many of Dr. Williams' 
trivialities {Springs Epitaph^ etc.) have become sweet 
instead of censorable. His grapes are not so sour as they 
once were, although this may be no great matter. 

There are more fine poems in the book than one can 
mention in a short review, among the most extraordinary 
being Romance ModemCy despite a few low spots. Occa- 
sionally a good poem is marred by some unnecessary 
triteness, as Overture to a Dance of Locomotives by its title 
and last line. Several fine poems have been omitted, 
among them Wild Orchard and A Coronal. I choose to 
end by quoting one poem without comment — The 
Nightingale: 

My shoes, as I lean 

unlacing them, 

stand out upon 

[219\ 




 

flat worsted flowers 

under my feet. 

Nimbly the shadows 

of my fingers play 

unladng 

over shoes and flowers.

A SUNLIT CLEARING 



Dreams OtU of Darkness, by Jean Starr Untermeyer. B. 

W. Huebsch. 

Jean Starr Untermeyer is so completely a mistress of 
form, that, though at times her content is weak, one still 
admires. To have pinned down form in these days of 
wavering outline! Lake Song realizes the lake suggestion, 
the rush forward and the sudden restraint, through toning 
down, becoming almost prose but subtly avoiding prose. 
The rhythm grows upon one, but since the matter is 
slight and inapt, grows upon one as a pattern woven of 
air, such an intangible pattern as the wind might have 
woven above her lake. In Sinfonia DomesHca and many 
other of the 'Voman" poems the poet is fundamental. 
These poems, when they do fail, fail for lack ofle mot juste; 
they are always psychologically poignant. Mastery of 
form is one achievement; of spirit, another; of diction, 
word and image, still another. Although I can understand 
how one might call Sinfonia Domestica a fine poem for its 
theme and passion, for me, although I grant the theme 
and passion and call them fundamental, it is a '* beating 


A Sunlit Clearing 

about the bush": there are many words but few clear-cut 
images, so many words that the essential motive is almost 
submerged. For me the two lines in the poem are: 

And bank my flame to a low hearth-fire, believing 
You'll come for warmth and life to its tempered gtow. 

From the Road in November is a good example of poetic 
paradox: expressing a thought in such a fashion as to 
create an atmosphere belying it. The first stanza is The 
Road in November^ no questioning that; the second and 
third stanzas are comfortable pictures having nothing to 
do with either November or death, so completely depart- 
ing from the keynote that the last two lines of the third 
stanza, in which the primary mood recurs, are rendered 
impotent. 

But then the last line of Little Dirge — 

My youth is slipping through the door — 

is SO complete and so profound that it might be one of 
Yvor Winters' Musterbook poems, and stand alone. 

In Berkshire Twilight, again paradox. The first stanza 
is inconsequential; I quote the second: 

Evening drops over their peaks 
And chars their flame. 
Their cok>r sifts into grajmess. 
With me it is the same. 

A preponderance of r% voluptuous sound that nullifies 
the negativity of even such a word as chars. There are 
certain words that, in spite of their accepted definition, 

one may not use in writing in certain contexts. Flame 
and color here outweigh not only grayness and sifty but the 
three dulling periods. The poem has the effect of a double 
negative. Impressionism understands the art of juxta- 
position of word as of sound and of color. I am put in 
jmind of two lines of an autumn poem by Janet Lewis: 

The deer, the deer, among the withered asters. 
The spider making tight his web. 

On Temples y though propagandistic, is apt. Eve Before 

the Tree I should call a brave failure. The story scarcely 

lends itself to psychological treatment. It has in fact 

been told perfectly in the third chapter of Genesis. 

Consciousness is the anathema of this generation. Let 

us pray that our children will not be introspective. Eve 

analyzes, digs up motives; she is more the Eve of after the 

eating than before it. Not to mention such anachronisms 

as: 

If there was life before 
I have forgotten it, nor can remember 
Father nor mother, sister, nurse, nor friend. 

Dreams Out of Darkness is in truth uneven in texture. 
Throughout one finds an abundant womanly sympathy, 
the power of nice observation, and a deftness in the 
employment of metrics. The rhythms are plastic and 
comfortable. If one objects to the paucity of idea in, 
say. Misty one finds oneself instantly refuted by the 
authenticity of Anti-erotic and Little Dirge. Throughout 
one finds vacillation between the naturalistic method and 


A Sunlit Clearing 

the conventionally poetic. The tone is muted, always in 
a low key. There are no new words, no significant digres- 
sions, no discoveries. But one has a sense of having gone 
into a woman's heart, found it lovely and understandable, 
and come out satisfied with womankind. The tiptoe of 
rapture, however, is not there. Two and a Child is perhaps 
representative: 

Does the spring night call little boys 

As it calls their wild young mothers? 

But what can a child know of us — or others? 

He has different joys. 

A tree that bend? and almost smothers 

Two in the road who clasp and quiver, 

To him is only a swing by the river — 

One of his outdoor toys. 

Put him to bed and let us flee 

Out in the night with other lovers. 

It will not be long till he discovers 

What's known to you and me. 

And then when a desdned maiden hovers 

Near for what only he can give her . . . 

No! Close the door. What makes me shiver? 

I will stay here. Let me be.

TARNISHED GOLD 

Paul Verlaine^ by Harold Nicolson. Houghton Mifflin G). 
This book is a dispassionate appraisal of the life and 
work of the greatest French symbolist poet. The reader 
who delights in a good biography should follow step by 
step through his dark byways of struggle this poet of the 

'* shifty Mongolian eyes/' should apprehend his pitiful 
weaknesses and failures. He was like other boys con- 
stitutionally, although perhaps handicapped by the fact 
that he was the only child of parents who were already 
middle-aged when he was born. It is interesting to read 
of his days of schooling, of how at eighteen he obtained 
his degree at the Sorbonne, "like other ordinary French 
schoolboys, with no brilliance, but quite creditably." Mr. 
Nicolson tells us that in general Verlaine's childhood had 
little effect upon his future development. The great factor 
in his life was alcohol, and this had not menaced him 
before the age of eighteen. 

Verlaine's life is the story of hopes and disappointments 
not unknown to other poets. But in his case the green 
of absinthe spread its taint over everything. He made 
great efforts at reform, notably once when for a year the 
influence of his young wife kept him sober. But the evil 
days returned invariably, and he became an habitual 
inebriate. It is hard to believe that in spite of the devils 
which were dragging him down his literary output did not 
seem to suffer, and that some of liis most beautiful poems 
were born of these times. 

And yet many of those which he wrote before this 
period have touched the human heart more poignantly 
than those of his maturer years; indeed in the last few 
years of his life his work sometimes showed Symbolism 
gone wrong — it was so steeped in intimate details as to be 
banal. But Verlaine at his best can throw us into an 


Tarnished Gold 

atmosphere: if he writes about a mist, the hair feels wet 
with mist; if he writes of a garden we actually inhale the 
warm perfume, so subtly does he use intimacy, suggestion, 
association — the fundamentals of Symbolism. Other 
poetry has had these qualities, from the Greeks down; 
but, as Mr. Nicholson points out: "The Symbolists were 
the first to raise what had been an accidental virtue in 
others to the level of a doctrine for themselves." And he 
says also: "Verlaine did not invent Symbolism — he 
certainly did not direct its future development; but he 
was able at the psychological moment to catch and reflect 
the floating aspiration, and to give to it a definite cadence 
and a form." 

A comparatively large portion of the book is devoted to 
the life of Arthur Rimbaud, and after reading these 
chapters we realize that to have given less space to the 
subject would have been to omit what is a valuable con- 
tribution to a true understanding of Verlaine's character. 
Mr. Nicolson has scant liking for Rimbaud, and his 
picture of this writer is not attractive. A large, red-fisted 
boy, with filthy hair that hung down lank between his 
shoulders, a snub nose and a damp fleshy mouth. He 
regards his entrance into the life of Verlaine as the greatest 
influence for evil that ever came near it. He tells us how 
Rimbaud forced himself upon Verlaine, how Verlaine 
forced Rimbaud upon his literary intimates in Paris — a 
very tactless performance, and how he dragged him to 
gatherings where he behaved like the boor he was and 

JFrotn which he was promptly excluded. He became linked 

with all his friend's doings: he drank with him, helped 

him to spend his poor mother's capital, left him when 

there were no resources, and reappeared when he found it 

to his profit to do so; and he enticed him on the fateful 

and ever to be regretted trip to London. 

Yet the most enthusiastic followers of Rimbaud cannot 

accuse Mr. Nicolson of having failed to estimate his work 

at its true value. In speaking of the Bateau Ivre he calls 

it an astounding production: 

That is should be the work of a boy of sixteen is well-nigh incredible. 
In the glare of its inspiration the glib architecture of the Pamasaans, 
the cadence of Verlaine's own poetry, assume but a paltry complexion. 
No wonder that the generation of today looks for stimulus to Rimbaud 
rather than to Verlaine or even Mallarm^ — to Rimbaud, who at nine- 
teen was forever to fling literature behind him. 

He designates Saison en Enfer as an acid human document, 
and speaks at length of Les Illuminations^ which, after the 
former, is most typical of Rimbaud's "unpleasing genius." 
Aube^ in this collection, he considers to be as fine a prose 
poem as exists in any language. 

Mr. Nicolson explains that he had hoped at first to give 
in an appendix a translation of the poems quoted in the 
text. We are glad that he abandoned the plan. Doubt- 
less he, if anyone, could express Verlaine's poetry in 
English. But attempts by others to render into our 
language even French poets more easily translated are 
almost sure to be disappointing, few of the results rising 
above libretto English. Mr. Nicolson has decided wisely, 


Tarnished Gold 

and it is a pleasure to find that he has given us almost all 
of the poems which are the most exquisite or the most 
characteristic in the tongue in which they were meant to 
exist. The author says: "Verlaine of all poets is too 
elusive to admit of translation^ and above all of a literal 
translation into English prose.'' This is what I have 
maintained whenever I have spoken of Verlaine's work in 
other articles in this magazine. The peculiar music is 
purely an emanation of his own atmosphere — perhaps 
more so than in the case of any other foreign poet. His^ 
syncopation is of the sort to be found in no other language 
than his own. To omit it, or to try to approach its like, 
could hardly fail to be a distortion. 

This whole book is carried through with a subtle, yet 
firm and often audacious touch. Scholarly it certainly is, 
but not in the sense of that word which restricts the 
pedagogic mind. There are a few inaccuracies — the 
American reader will be surprised to learn that Stuart 
Merrill is an Englishman! — and there are occasional 
phrases which startle; but these are slight flaws. 

The author bares Verliune's weaknesses and gives his 
mitigating characteristics, without a hint as to his own 
opinions regarding them. He lays the facts before you, 
and it is for you to conclude. He tells us, incidentally, 
in the Rimbaud chapters, that Verlaine had no spark of 
jealousy or personal ambition, and that he flung himself 
with real generosity into the task of helpings other poets. 
Those who derive from this poet's work only an aroma of 

the wine-shop, who picture him first of all as a vulgar sot, 
will have a change of heart after reading this biography. 
Paul Verlaine had noble traits, he had lovable traits; and 
these went into his poetry. Agnes Lee Freer

An Anthology of Jugoslav Poetry. Edited by Dr. B. S. 

Stanoye^ch. Richard G. Badger. 

The vigor and elegantly tutored violence of the Russian 
ballet, the drastic investigations and discoveries of Rus- 
sian fiction, the naive splendor of Russian piunting, and 
Russian music with its delicate French soul in a rioting 
body, may lead you to expect, in Russian poetry, some- 
thing equally vivid and fresh, a balancing surprise. You 
may be prepared, as I was, to add to the French and 
English — the only modern literatures, so far as I can dis- 
cover, that have a life and character of their own and 
enjoy the distinction of possessing masterpieces — a Rus- 
sian literature embodying that figment of the European 
imagination, the Slavic Soul. 


Slavic Poetry 

Modem Russian Poetry j if approached with such expec- 
tationsy will bring a somewhat chilly disillusion. For 
until the last pages there are no particularly arresting 
poems. And the last poems, while they deal with events 
that may be localized, have fortunately no local flavor. 
They are written in the tone and from the attitude of 
the modern man everywhere in the world; in the same 
idiom and with the same ratiocination. 

In many ways the haunting anachronism of Russia's 
political machine has stalked and parried its poems. One 
feels not only confusion, but even evasion, of realities. 
Russian poets have been led to sentimentalize their atti- 
tude to the land, to life, to the peasantry, to the misery 
of Russia. Patriotism and Revolution trespass continu- 
ally, and are unpleasantly immobilized in figures of speech. 
And foo often the poets' exaltation is the rapid breath of 
running away; their simplicity, the content of hasty 
refuge. 

Russian life is too tentative, too provisional. If stands 
stark in the thinking; the hurdle of every decision. To 
my mind, it has been the reason for much of the mysticism. 
Much of the pessimism and despair is also traceable to 
this ghastly warning. To be faced continually with this 
lean and quick-legged and always outstripping 7/" is finally 
to lose hope. 

Alexander Blok in his wonderful Scythians repeats it. 
Russia is undecided, wavering. She is between East and 
West, between a beloved betrayer and his foe ambushed 

by her elbow. Magnificent and challenging is the poem; 
a clue to the instability of Russian life. 

As this anthology reveals it, we have the poetry of a 
troubled minor literature, exceedingly rich in promise. 
Unless it is a mere activity of sick nerves, the intensity 
of life in Russia today should bring great poetry — is 
bringing a hint of it in the poetry of the minute. 

The book may be r^arded also as a fine contribution to 
English literature. Never is one conscious that the work 
is a translation. For the approximately one hundred and 
twenty Russian poems which have been rendered, parallel 
English poems have been created. 

The notes are perhaps too copious. They make of the 
book almost a guide to Russian literature, with excerpts 
for illustration. The method betrays itself most keenly 
when, in the case of Baratynsky, a closely printed para- 
graph of two hundred words introduces a verselet of six 
puny lines whose banality too impudently satirizes the 
expectations raised by the fattening preface. 

To realize that nationalism has made a great master of 
Pushkin is to appreciate the unhappy effects of this 
virtuoso emotion, proud of the iridescence of stagnation. 
Reports come that young poets are harking back to Push- 
kin — it is pitiful, with so many powerful men about them. 

To me the book's area of interest begins with Valery 
Brusov, although stray poems before him paint the desert. 
Ivanov, Blok, Byely, Kluyev, Yesenin, Oreshin, and 
Marienhof — these shouting, a bit strident, a bit knowing, 


Slavic Poetry 

but independent and conscious young poets are the poets 

of Russia. The buzzing Pushkin, the crooning Lermontov, 

the ballyhooing Konstantin Balmont, are the bad starts 

of Russian poetry. 

These young men write as original poets are writing in 

England, France and America. Marienhof might almost 

be a Russian visit of Ezra Pound: 

Jesus is on the Cross ag^ain, and Barrabas 
We escort, mealy-mouthed, down the Tverskoi Prospekt. . . 
Who will interrupt, who? The gallop of Scythian horses? 
Violins bowing the Marseillaise? 



Pile rubbish, all the rubbish in a heap; 
And like Savonarola, to the sound of hymns. 
Into the fire with it. . . Whom should wc fear? — 
When the mundiculi of puny souls have become — ^worlds. 

A quatrain from Yesenin contains an image that has 
obsessed me: 

From empty straths, a slender arch ascending: 

Fog curls upon the air and, moss-wise, grows; 

And evening, low above the wan streams bending, 

In their white waters washes his blue toes. 

These whbpers will not give any suggestion of the full- 
throated singing of the two poets quoted. For these, 
and their splendid company in the last half of the book, 
redeem the whole book; make it about as valuable as 
any book of poetry recently issued in America. 

Mr. Selver's Anthology of Slavonic Literature attempts 
too much, and therefore the results are negligible. The 
job might as well not have been done. To represent 

adequately the prose of Russia, Poland, Bohemia, Jugo- 
Slavia, etc., in one ordinary volume, and pack in the 
poetry of these peoples as well, is so obviously futile that 
it is a wonder to me that so accomplished an editor and 
critic tried to do it. 

Mr. Selver's book of Czech verse is admirable, however. 
The translation flavor is sometimes on these verses, but 
it gives an exotic aroma which makes one pleasantly 
aware of tasting something foreign. One feels that the 
pre-contemporary Czech poets were stronger and more 
robust than their brothers in Russia. This little book 
will serve as a companion to Modem Russian Poetry ^ 
although different in spirit . and manner, and even in 
format. The original texts are included. 

Space is lacking for extracts, which indeed would give 
scarcely a hint of the quality of some of the poetry in 
this book; but I wish to call attention to a remarkable 
nationalist, whose utterance has the stark obsessive 
simplicity of frenzy, and is extraordinarily effective: Pietr 
Bezruc, whose poems are too long and continuous for 
quotation. They are written somewhat in the sweeping 
manner of Whitman, who has strongly influenced Czech 
poetry. 

The Stanoyevich anthology is mentioned last because 
it has so little affinity with the others. Its title is 
anomalous, for all the poetry given is folk-song. The 
specimens given are melodious, charming, but a bit one- 
stringed and monotonous. Isidor Schneider 


NOTES 

Mr. Alfred Kreymborg, author of Mushrooms^ Blood of Things, 
Plays for Poem-mimes , Plays for Merry- Andrews, founder of Others of 
happy memory, has often appeared in Poetry. Since his retirement 
from the editorship of the international monthly Broom, Mr. and Mrs. 
Kreymborg have left Rome and at last accounts were sojourning at 
Rapallo. Pianissimo will be included in a book to be published this 
autumn — by which of his numerous publishers the author does not 
. state. 

Miss Lola Ridge, now once more in New York, has recently become 
the American editor of Broom, with an office at 3 East Ninth Street. 
Her books. The Ghetto and Sun-up, are published by B. W. Huebsch. 

Mr. John Hall Wheelock, of New York, author of Dust and Light 
and earlier books of verse, will publbh, through Charles Scribner's 
Sons, a new book this autumn. 

Mr. Morris Gilbert is now once more in New York, after his naval 
service in the war and later experiences in the Near East and elsewhere. 
His first volume, A Book of Verse, was issued privately in 19 17. 

Mr. A. A. Rosenthal is now living in Birmingham, Ala. 

Of the three English poets represented this month, two have appeared 
before in Pobtry: 

Mrs. Anna Wickham's first book. The Contemplative Quarry, was 
first published in London, by the Poetry Book Shop, in 191 5, when 
Padraic G)lum reviewed it in our pages. Last year Harcourt Brace 
& Co. issued a larger volume under a double title. The Contemplative 
^arry and The Man with a Hammer, with an appreciative introduction 
by Louis Untermeyer. A new volume will appear this aiitumn. 

Mr. Louis Golding is the author of Sorrows of War (E. P. Dutton 
& Co.) and Shepherd Singing Ragtime, Mr. Golding, usually in Lon- 
don, is now sojourning in the Austrian Tyrol. 

Miss Rosamond Langbridge, a resident of Hambrook, Hampshire, 
England, is the only poet of the month who is new to our readers. 

Mr. E. K. Broadus requests the correction of an error in the Notes 
of our May number. He is of the faculty of the University of Alberta, 
Canada, not the University of Manitoba.

The Daily Journal, East St. Louis 

The varied interest and beauty presented are typical of 
POETRY'S quality. Thanks to a rare coincidence of 
poise and generous imagination, of sense and sensitiveness, 
it ranks easily as the best vehicle of poetry in the English 
language. 

From an editorial in the New York Sunday Tribune. 

POETRY has become a significant force 
in the intellectual life of America. That 
astute observer, the late William Marion 
Reedy, wrote: **Probably Miss Monroe has 
done more for the high art of song than any 
other person in the United States'' — a state- 
ment which has been generously supported 
by other commentators of similar prestige.

THESE ARE BUT WORDS 

THE SONNET 

WHAT Other form were worthy of your praise 
But this lute-voice, mocking the centuries 
In many a silvery phrase that hallowed is 
By love not faltering with lengthening days? 
A lute that I have little worth to raise 
And little skill to sound — yet not amiss 
Your love may find it, since my heart in this 
Only one thing for your heart only says. 

These are no perfect blossoms I offer you, 
No rose whose crimson cup all longing slakes. 
Not moonflowers, sunflowers, flowers rich of hue, 


Nor silver lilies mystical with dew — 

No more than bluets, blown when April takes 

Millions of them to make one meadow blue. 



I have been happy: let the falcon fly, 
And follow swiftly where the light wings whir — 
Let him bring down the reckless wanderer. 
Snatch back that es^er rapture from the sky! 
And I have been contented: let me cry 
My discontent, until, like reeds astir 
Before the swift, the tragic whisperer. 
Broken are these frail dreams that satisfy! 

I have khown laughter: make me blind with tears. 

\ have loved silence: make me deaf with sound. 

For every joy set vengeful grief above. 

I will not shrink before the threatening years; 

I will not falter, I will not give ground; 

And I will love as you would have me love! 

II 

I have a thousand pictures of the sea — 

Snatches of song and things that travellers say. 

I know its shimmering from green to gray; 

At dawn and sunset it is plain to me. 

Like something known and loved for years will be 


Muna Lee 



That sight of it when I shall come some day 
Where little waves and great waves war and play. 
And little winds and great winds fly out free. 

Of love I had no pictures: love would come 
Like any casual guest whom I could greet 
Serenely, and serenely let depart — 
Love, that came like fire and struck me dumb, 
That came like wind and swept mc from my feet. 
That came like lightning shattering my heart. 

Ill 

Life of itself will be cruel and hard enough: 
There will be loss and pain enough to bear; 
Battles to wage, sorrow and tears to share. 
We must know grief — the bitter taste thereof; 
Must mark the Shadow towering above; 
Must shut our eyes to gain the strength to dare. 
And force tired hearts to face the noise and glare 
Though it is dusk and silence that we love. 

Life has no need of stones that we might heap 
To build up walls between; no need of tears 
That we seek out and proudly make our own. 
O my beloved, since we have alone 
These brief hours granted from the hurrying years. 
Be patient — life itself will make us weep! 

IV 

There have been many Junes with larkspur blowing. 
Many Octobers with crimson-berried haws, 
When from my heart regret like smoke withdraws, 
Wreath after wreath, to watch the sunsets glowing, 
And see tall poplars make so brave a showing 
Against pale skies at dusk. There were no flaws 
To mar the summer for me; never pause 
In my delight for winds and waters flowing. 

Yet was all beauty beauty uncompleted. 
Vaguely perceived, not truly heard and seen; 
Or seen as are the hills with mist between, 
Or heard as song thin echoes have repeated; 
Until you gave earth meaning, giving me 
The love that lifts the heart to hear and see. 



You have not known the autumns I have known. 

November for you has bloomed as bright as spring. 

With tropic suns to glow and birds to sing. 

And flowers more vivid than mine in August blown. 

You have made, beside, those autumns half your own 

That come with ice and sleet and wind, to sting 

The blood itself to ruddy blossoming — 

Such autumns as the bleak North knows alone. 


" Muna Lee 

My autumns are merely quiet, and they show 

Straight trees that are bared alike of leaves and snow — 

Yet it is only thus you can know the trees. 

Love proud enough to forego bloom and song. 

To strip the boughs of foliage; bare and strong 

To bide your judgment, would be most like these. 

VI 

It would be easy to say: ''The moon and lake 
Made wizardry — how could we see aright? 
That was a world unreal in silver light. 
And we were lovers for the moment's sake. 
It was youth spoke in us, quick to mistake ' 
Earth-lamp for dawn, the mirage for true sight; 
Hailing a hill-crest as the long-sought height. 
Swearing such oaths as honors us to break." 

That would be easiest: then no regret 
Could chill a heart grown happy to forget, 
Nor touch a soul that sophistry sufficed. 
There was a man once, in a hall of trial. 
Thrice before cock-crow uttered such denial — 
And knows forever that he denied the Christ! 

VII 

I make no question of your right to go — 
Rain and swift lightning, thunder and the sea, 


POETRY? A Magazine oj Verse 

Sand and dust and ashes are less free! 

Follow all paths that wings and spread sails know; 

Unheralded you came, and even so 

If so you will, may you take leave of me. 

Yours is your life, and what you will shall be. 

I ask no question: hasten or be slow! 

But I who would not hold you — I who give 
Your freedom to you with no word to say; 
And, watching quietly, with my prayers all dumb, 
Speed you to any life you choose to live — 
Shall ask God's self, incredulous, some day. 
Why in the name of Christ He let you come! 

VIII 

No love can quite forego the battle-field; 
Since life is struggle, and love and life are one. 
No soul is quiet and sheltered enough to shun 
The tireless foes at work to make love yield. 
Not flowers and samite, but lance and shield 
Were dower of love; not wreath but gonfalon; 
And while the bitter struggle is unwon 
Not even to faith is all the truth revealed. 

Each heart its own most dreaded foe must meet; 
Each heart its own conspiracies must lay. 
And fight what it finds hardest to defeat. 
Mine is it to meet Doubt in serried mass 


Muna Lee 

Stronger and subtler with each toilsome day; 
Yet steel my soul to swear, "They shall not pass." 

IX 

It will be easy to love you when I am dead — 
Shadowed from light and shut away from sound, 
Held deeper than the wild roots underground, 
Where nothing can be changed and no more said. 
All will be uttered then: beyond the dread 
Of failure in you or me, I shall have found 
Most perfect quietness to fold me round. 
Where I can dream while all Time's years are sped. 

But now Life roars about me like a sea. 
Sears me like flame, is thunder in my ears. 
There is no time for song, no space for tears. 
And every vision has forsaken me. 
In a world earthquake-shaken, lightning-charred, 
Love is the hardest where all things are hard. 

Muna Lee 


AT NIGHT 

THE SLEEPER 

Night, O heavy breather in the surf of sleep. 
What is that strange and rosy slenderness 
You hold against your heart with so much tenderness? 

The Sleeper. It is my wife I hold — 
I love her more than life. 
She has hair of bronze and gold. 
And in twin strands divides it; 
It lies across her bosom surplice-wise. 
This I know to be true though darkness hides it. 

Night. Now all things false dissolve beneath the moon! 
This is a sheaf of whispering dreams you hold. 
Bound by the tawny sinews of your arm. 
They nod together with plumes of bronze and gold. 
They breathe and are warm; 
They speak together in a sibilant tune. 

The Sleeper. It is my own wife. 
Her mouthy that is merry and wise, 
Is shut; and the lids are shut that cover 
Her faithful eyes. 

Night. A sheaf of dreams — hush ! 

The First Dream. She is untrue, 

Brother and brother! 
This one is new — 
Where is the other? 

T242] 



 



Jessica Nelson North 



The Second Dream. 



The Third Dream. 



The Fourth Dream. 



I hear men say 
He had ceased to love her. 
Even today 

His voice can move her. 
I have seen her tremble 
When she meets his eyes. 
She is deft with lies. 
She is (|uick to dissemble. 
How is this done. 
Brother and brother. 
To sleep with one 
And dream of another? 



Night. A sheaf of dreams, of dreams 
The Sleeper. My wife. 
My wife. 



FIRST AUTUMN 

All in our pearl-pale window 
The moon's aroma hung. 

My love and I together 
Our heads upon one pillow, 
Looked out where an elm upflung 
A branch like a peacock feather. 

Heigho, first autumn weather! 

DREAMS 

You curve your body into a vibrant ball, 
Dead drunk with sleep. 
I have no part in your slumber-scheme at all, 
I cannot strike that deep. 

You hold me insecurely in your life 

As a sand-dune holds' trees. 

I say, "It is five months — I am your wife." 

What shadow facts are these? 

I put my hand into your breast. It lies 

Unowned, apart. 

While more familiar hands . . . and lips . . . and eyes 

Press close around your heart. 



SUDDENLY 

We have a gray room. The walls are gray and bare. 
I have hung pictures and set flowers there. 
I have made curtains with wide and snowy hem 
For our tiny windows to make the best of them. 

You look at me. Your look is still and gray. 
Your look is cool and dim and far away. 
I cannot open the stubborn husks that shut 
Your heart away like the kernel in a nut. 


Jessica Nelson North 



I am afraid of what is in your heart. 

I mus,t probe deep; I must tear your mood apart. 

Suddenly like a rocket, unaware, 

Your eyes blossom and flare! 



BOGIE 

The black rain settles in our empty block. 

The drunken street-lamps leer with sidelong eyes, 

Dim and unholy. 

Old newspapers, grown restless in the gutter, 

With flap and flutter 

Rise and subside and rise. 

It is half-past-twelve-o'clock. 

The night — ^goes — slowly. 

I am awake again. I cannot sleep. 

I light the lamp again, and draw the shutter. 

I light the lamp against the feet that creep, 

The sounds that mutter. 

I draw the shutter against the lids that peep. 

Something goes crouching at the dripping flank 
Of the broken wall! Something in tatters slips 
Down alleys dank! 

Something from door to door before the rain 
Dodges and whines! Something with twisting lips 
Terribly smiles outside my shuttered pane! 



BOATMAN 



Boatman, leaning on your pole on the Secret River, 
Will you tarry for a soul who never knew a lover? 
She is very young and cold, her beauty makes me shiver. 
I will give you coins of gold to take her softly over. 



TO THE MAN WHO LOVES TWILIGHT 

Why do you go along the street caressing with quiet eyes 
Gray walls, bleak houses, and the dull wet skies? 
Have all things gray your blessing? 

We do not love your twilight, God and I. 

He pelts the rainy heaven 

With gorgeous autumn, — hangs the dripping trees 

With yellow apples of Hesperides 

In lines 

Sweetly uneven. 

Loops every sodden fence with scarlet vines. . . . 

And where you sit 

Sufficient to yourself, hugging the gloom, 
I prance with rustling silk and candles lit 
To make an orgy in our quiet room. 

Jessica Nelson North 




YOUR HANDS 

Hands, your hands, quite calm now 

At the day's end, 

You are not delicately molded, not exquisite. 

Not gentle always. . . • 

You are scarred, 
With broken lines — 
Sultry lines of passion. 
There are grotesques in you, 
Like forests after fire. 

You hold valleys of renunciation. 
And crags shaken by the storm. 
That only faiths like wild goats know. 

Yet now rises, within that dark repose. 
Beauty, as she comes hooded at twilight. . . 

Ah, do not touch me, yet . . . 



FROM THE TELEPHONE 

Out of the dark cup 

Your voice broke like a flower. 

It trembled, swaying on its taut stem. 

The caress in its touch 

Made my eyes close. 

Florence Ripley Mastin 
BEGINNING AND END 

ELDERS 

At night the moon shakes the bright dice of the water; 
And the elders, their flower light as broken snow upon the 

bushy 
Repeat the circle of the moon. 

Within the month 

Black fruit breaks from the white flower. 

The black-wheeled berries turn 

Weighing the boughs over the road. 

There is no harvest. 

Heavy to withering, the black wheels bend 

Ripe for the mouths of chance lovers. 

Or birds. 

Twigs show again in the quick cleavage of season and 

season. 
The elders sag over the powdery road-bank, 
As though they bore, and it were too much, . 
The seed of the year beyond the year. 



RESOLVE 

So that I shall no longer tarnishwith my finge^-s 
The bright steel of your power, 


Louise Bogan 



I shall be hardened against you, 
A shield tightened upon its rim. 

A stern oval to be pierced by no weapon. 
Metal stretched and shaped against you. 
For a long time I shall go 
Spanned by the round of my strength. 

Changeless, in spite of change, 

My resolve undefeated; 

Though now I see the evening moon, soon to wane, 

Stand clearly and alone in the early dark. 

Above the stirring spindles of the leaves. 



KNOWLEDGE 



Now that I know 
That passion warms little 
Of flesh in the mold. 
And treasure is brittle, 

ril lie here and learn 
How, over their ground. 
Trees make a long shadow 
And a light sound. 



LEAVE-TARING 

I do not know where cither of us can turn 

Just at first, wakii^ from the sleep of each other. 

I do not know how we can bear 

The river struck by the gold plummet of the moon, 

Or many trees shaken together in the darkness. 

We shall wish not to be alone 

And that love were not dispersed and set free — 

Though you defeat me, 

And I be heavy upon you. 

But like earth heaped over the heart 

Is love grown perfect. 

Like a shell over the beat of life 

Is love perfect to the last. 

So let it be the same 

Whether we turn to the dark or to the kiss of another; 

Let us know this for leavetaking, 

That I may not be heavy upon you, 

That you may blind me no more. 



TO A DEAD LOVER 

The dark is thrown 

Back from the brightness, like hair 

Cast over a shoulder. 

I am alone, 


Louise Bogan 

Four years older; 

Like the chairs and the walls 

Which I once watched brighten 

With you beside me. I was to waken 

Never like this, whatever came or was taken. 

The stalk grows, the year beats on the wind. 
Apples come, and the month for their fall. 
The bark spreads, the roots tighten. 
Though today be the last 
Or tomorrow all, 
You will not mind. 

That I may not remember 

Does not matter. 

I shall not be with you again. 

What we knew, even now 

Must scatter 

And be ruined, and blow 

Like dust in the rain. 

You have been dead a long season 
And have less than desire 
Who were lover with lover; 
And I have life — that old reason 
To wait for what comes, 
To leave what is over. 

Louise Bogan 

POEMS FROM THE CHINESE 

In the original syllabic and rhyme scheme^ to accompany the 
Chinese chanting tunes. 

AN OLD man's song OF SPRING 

By Seng Dji-Nan (Sung Dynasty) 

Among the trees I may yet 
Enjoy the day at sunset; 

For willow winds are not cold, 
Apricot rains are not wet. 



SEEKING THE HERMIT JN VAIN 

By Gia Dao (Tang Dynasty) 



** Gone to gather herbs" — 
So they say of you. 

But in cloud-girt hills, 
What am I to do? 



ON BEING DENIED ADMITTANCE TO A FRIEND S GARDEN 

By Yeh Shih {Sung Dynasty) 

Although your gate bar my way. 
You cannot check the spring's play; 

For free above your proud wall 
There hangs one apricot spray. 


Louise S. Hammond 

THE SUDDEN COMING OF SPRING 

By Cheng Hao (Sung Dynasty) 

Scant clouds just flake the noon sky; 
By willowed streamlets stroll I. 

But men know not my heart's joy, 
And say, "Old fool, the hours fly." 

NIGHT-TIME IN SPRING 

By fFang An-Shih (Sung Dynasty) 

Silence reigns where sound has been; 
Chill the breeze, half soft, half keen; 

While the moon through sleepless hours 
Shifts dark blossoms up the screen. 

Translated by Louise S. Hammond

SUMMER PHASES 



THE SPREE 



In the uplift of spring 
Earth had high thoughts in trees; 
Smiling her apple-blossoms^ 
Blushing her peach-petals. 
Delicate as a sprite. 

Now she sprawls. 

Making loose gestures with spreading vines; 
Guffawing vegetables and fruits — 
Harlequin melons, Punchinello squashes — 
Hiccoughing cucumbers, stuttering tomatoes. 
She is mad-drunk with summer. 

Soon she'll lie still, 

Decently covered with the leaf-brown quilt. 

She'll give loud, gusty yawns, then sleep. 

Jeered at by rains, pitied by snow; 

And wake to chastened, stiff sobriety. 

TRANSIT 

The purple shadow clings with desperate will 
Tightly to the granite hill; 
Tries to grow to it, 
I try, beloved, dear, 


Katherine Wisner McCJuskey 

To carve me out one solid moment here — 
Afraid of cruel winds to blow, 
Winds implacable that know 
Shadows go. 

Winds strip shadows off from hills. 

Signalled by cloudy change above. 

An instant's whim, and death may harry love. 

Should it sever you from me, 

I drift, I drift. 

Agnostic of reality. 



A PARABLE 

The magnolia bud 

Loosens her white garments 

With exquisite reserve. 

So love unfolds 

While delicate mysteries, 

Like odors. 

Subtly escape. 

The white magnolia. 
Of lucent petals 
Textured like woman skin. 
Crumples to leather 
Limp and brown. 
Binding a story told. 




 

WHOLLY HAPPY 

This is the Sabbath Day. 

I keep it my own way. 

I do not need to go to church to pray. 

Feeling and being me 
Is good as good can be. 
I claim my own identity. 

I am as happy as a flower 
Perfuming its one hour 
With a sweet sense of power. 

I am unfettered as a bee 

That cleaves a tiny path, but free. 

Choosing an orange-blossoming tree. 

Making my honey as it does, 
I feel as holy as saint ever was. 
This is my perfume, prayer and buzz. 

Katherine fFisner McCluskey 




TALK FROM THE DUST 

THE SKY 

I saw a shadow on the ground> 
And heard a bluejay going by. 

A shadow went across the ground. 
And I looked up and saw the sky. 

It hung up on the poplar tree, 
But while I looked it did not stay; 

It gave a tiny sqrt of jerk 
And moved a little bit away. 

And farther on and farther on 

It moved and never seemed to stop. 

I think it must be tied with chains, 
And something pulls it from the top. 

It never has come down again; 

And every time I look to see. 
The sky is always slipping back 

And getting far away from me. 



NUMBERS 

When I can count the numbers far 
And know all the figures that there are, 

Then I'll know everything, and I 

Can know about the ground and the sky, 

And all the little bugs I see; 

And rU count the leaves on the poplar tree, 

And all the days that ever can be. 

ril know all the cows and sheep that pass, 
And rU know all the grass, 

And all the places far away; 

And rU know everything some day. 



AUTUMN 

Dick and Will and Charles and I 

Were playing it was election day; 
And I was running for president, 

And Dick was a band that was going to play. 

And Charles and Will were a street parade. 
But Clarence came, and said that he 

Was going to run for president, 
And I could run for school-trustee. 

He made some flags for Charles and Will, 
And a badge to go on Dickie's coat. 

He stood some cornstalks by the fence 
And had them for the men that vote. 


Elizabeth Madox Roberts 

Then he climbed on a box and made a speech 
To the cornstalk men that were in a row. 

It was all about the Dem-o-crats, 
And "I de-fy any man to show*'; 

And "I de-fy any man to say", 

And all about "It's a big disgrace". 
He spoke his speech out very loud 

And shook his fist in a cornstalk's face. 



THE PEOPLE 

The ants are walking under the ground. 
And the pigeons are flying over the steeple; 
And in between are the people. 



A BEAUTIFUL LADY 

We like to listen to her dress; 

It makes a whisper by her feet. 
Her little pointed shoes are gray; 

She hardly lets them touch the street. 

Sometimes she has a crumpled fan. 

Her hat is silvered on the crown, 
And there are roses by the brim 

That nod and tremble up and down. 

She conies along the pavement walk, 

And in a moment she is gone. 
She hardly ever looks at us, 

But once she smiled and looked at John. 

And so we run to see her pass 
And watch her through the fence, and I 

Can hear the others whispering, 
"Miss Josephine is going by." 

AUGUST NIGHT 

We had to wait for the heat to pass. 
And I was lying on the grass. 

While Mother sat outside the door. 
And I saw how many stars there were. 

Beyond the tree, beyond the air, 

And more and more were always there. 

So many that I think they must 
Be sprinkled on the sky like dust. 

A dust is coming through the sky! 
And I felt myself begin to cry. 

So many of them and so small — 
Suppose I cannot know them all. 

Elizabeth Madox Roberts 


SONG NETS 

Song netSy 

I weave you with all my love. 

You glitter like pearls and rubies ^ 

In you I catch songs like butterflies. 

You go past my reaching hand 

With a thin gauzy floating^ 

And the songs are caught 

Before they Jade away. 

Last night 

My hand caught a song 

Of pines and quiet rivers: 

I shall keep it forever. 



SNOW MORNING 

Morning is a picture again, 

With snow-pufFed branches 

Out of the wind; 

With the sky caught like a blue feather 

In the butternut tree. 

I cannot see the world behind the snow; 

But when I look into my mind, 

There, with all its people and colors, 

The world sits smiling 

Quite warm and cosy. 

WHAT I SAID 

Lilies of the valley, 

Bell-shaped moments clustered, 

Doves of time — ^little white doves 

Through the dusky sunset-colored air 

Set free, 

I stroke your wings, 

I stroke your folded wings. 


LITTLE GREEN BERMUDA POEM 

Green water of waves 
On the Bermuda beaches. 
White coral roads running away, 
Pink shells waiting for me to come, 

shall come some day. 
How would it sound to be there alone 
And hear the Atlantic Ocean 
Crash on bright rocks? 

This island is a great rainbow 

That lasts forever; 

People go and come 

And the waves forget them. 

I see the island turn and turn — 

A soap-bubble with rainbows drifting down, 

A rainbow ball turning . . . 

Always light, always glitter looking through. 


Hilda Conkling 



My poem that began with a green wave 
Has broken into colors. 



WHEN MOONLIGHT FALLS 

When moonlight falls on the water, 

It is like fingers touching the chords of a harp 

On a misty day. 

When moonlight strikes the water 

I cannot get it into my poem — 

I only hear the tinkle of ripplings of light. 

When I see the water's fingers and the moon's rays 

Intertwined, 

I think of all the words I love to hear 

And try to find words white enough 

For such shining. 

ELSA 

My sister stood on a hilltop 

Looking toward the sea. 

The wind was in her bronze-colored hair; 

She was an image 

On a broken wave . . . 

Foam was at her feet. 

So for a moment she wavered 

And was lovely: 

And I remember her. 



CLOUDY-PANSY 

Wandering down a dusty road> 

I met a gypsy. 

She might have dropped out of the trees. 

She had a green kerchief 

And a blue velvet skirt, 

A lavender cape 

And a gold locket: 

Green shoes on the feet 

That trod the powdery road 

To the marble-floored Vermont river 

Thinking as it goes along . . . 



FIELD-MOUSE 

Little brown field-mouse 

Hiding when the plough goes by. 

Timid creature that you are, 

Wild thing, 

Were you once in the forest? — 

Did you move to the fields? 

In your brown cloak 

You gather grain 

For your secret meals; 

You will build a house of earth 

The way you remember. 

From a baby up to your full-grown feeling 


Hilda Conkling 



You have run about the field, 
As other field-mice will run about 
When another century has come 
Like a cloud. 



Wind waves the reeds by the river, 
Grey sky lids the leaden water, 
Ducks fly low across the water, 
Three flying — one quacks sadly. 

Grey are the sky and the water, 
Grey the lost ribbons of reed-beds, 
Small in the silence a black boat 
Floats upon wide pale mirrors. 



Go fight, you fools! Tear up the earth with strife 
And spill each other's guts upon the field; 

Serve unto death the men you served in life 
So that their wide dominions may not yield. 

Stand by the flag — the lie that s^U allures; 

Lay down your lives for land you do not own, 
And give unto a war that is not yours 

Your gory tithe of mangled flesh and bone. 

But whether it be yours to fall or kill. 
You must not pause to question why nor where. 

You see the tiny crosses on that hill? 
It took all those to make one millionaire. 

It was for him the seas of blood were shed, 

That fields were razed and cities lit the sky; 
And now he comes to chortle o'er the dead — 
. The condor Thing for whom the millions die. 

The bugle screams, the cannons cease to roar. 

"Enough! enough! God give us peace again." 
The rats, the maggots and the Lords of War 

Are fat to bursting from their meal of men. 



Ti8 time, I think, by Wenlock town 

The golden broom should blow; 
The hawthorne, sprinkled up and down 

Should charge the land with snow. 
Spring will not wait the loiterer's time 

Who keeps so long away; 
So others wear the broom, and climb 

The hedgerows heaped with may. 
Oh, tarnish late on Wenlock Edge, 

Gold that I never see; 

Lie long, high snowdrift in the hedge 
That will not shower on me. 




RIDGE PEOPLE 


MY COUNTRY 



THEY were my people, 
And this country was my country. 

Deep ravines 

Send strange shadows into the valley. 

Rock ridges 

Bulwark returning ferns and flowers. 

Rock towers 

Watch the invading shadows. 

Hills mother children. 

Hills watch while children sleep. 

Fathomed in coulees, 
The spirit water-falls 
Say all there is to say. 


 



A NATIVE 

There ain't no poetry 

Like these middlin' hills 

And a slow stream gurglin* over stones. 

Them pines has lived four hundred years 

And asked nothin' of no one. 

Straight and tall and strong — 

Nothin' crooked about a pine. 

Religion, I call it. 

Pointing to the sky 

And slinging incense free. 

Did you ever hear 

A cedar valley moan a dirge 

Or sing an anthem ? 

nothin' — somethin' 

It ain't worth nothin' as land goes, 

And yet it's somethin'. 

Kinda nice — 

A hill of boulders 

Smilin' in the sun. 

I only took it because 'twas cheap. 

I wasn't one of them 

That had the earnin' guts 

To pick and choose. 

My girl and I have worked 





To coax the crops around these stones. 

She was pretty once — 

Lord, now her bones stick out 

Like ridge-poles in a tent. 

I ain't complainin'. 

The land — 

She'd say it wasn't any good 

Except to hold the world together. 

It's held her 

And me. 




Jim Burgantine said, 
"If any other man had tried 
To put over a plug hat 
In this Western burg 
He'd a been egged." 

Didn't follow fashion. 
He brought his hat from Massachusetts- 
It was a good hat 
And lasted forty years. 
For the matter of that, 
Eight months of the calendar 
He didn't wear a hat; 
He never did unnecessary things. 

He split a cracker 

If the scales tipped over a pound. 

He split a cracker 

If the scales tipped under a pound. 

When a neighbor was sick 

He sat up nights, 

And took the orphans home. 

Twenty-five thousand dollars. 
Earned in his corner grocery. 
Was scattered about the country 
Among the struggling farmers. 
Without trying to collect. 

He never said unnecessary words — 

Fe was a quiet man. 

No tombstone 

Shouts his name above the sod. 

grand-dad's bluff 

I knelt all day, 

Grand-dad, 

Pleading with you — 

But you had nothing to say. 

Night fell, 

And a message came 

Through your ravines. 



It did not speak either, 

But I heard it pass among the leaves of the trees. 

I drank it through my nostrils 

As one drinks wine through the mouth, 

And it tingled to the finger-tips of my spirit. 

I came to you, Grand-dad, with my heart. 

God bless you. Grand-dad. 

IN MIST 

When you can see the ground's breath. 

And the sky goes muggy 

And drops before the world 

Like a perspiring window-glass; 

When beasts and humans creep to cover 

And the steam-boats speak fog-language'; 

The farm buildings sit still 

Folding their hands 

As if they hadn't a thing in the world to do. 

A chimney's belch smudges into nothing; 

The earth's breath noses around the roots of trees; 

Heaven-mist seeps through branches 

And wraps the country's heart. 

LIGHT MAGIC 

The valley curves like a bridge-span to the sky. 

Blue granite stew-pans spill pink begonias along the road. 

The town hall, blazing red, focuses the red stubble of the 

fields 
Which stretch away to gold-stacked corn-stalks, 
And Wisconsin hills — piled cubes of red and yellow. 
The sunset catches the landscape in layers. 
Its amber floats a banner of pastels around the town. 



LATE AUTUMN IN THE HILLS 

A flock of birds 

Spurts down the trail of autumn. 

Bare hills 

Wrap fog-blankets about them, 

And nod. . . . 

A whirl of wind 

Scatters wild rice over the lake. 

There is a shake of snow in the air. 
My boat moors in the sedges. 

My hand 

Droops over the side of the boat. 

My fingers 

Touch a lotus pod. 

The seeds rattle in the husk. 

Autumjf^s anchored. 





THE SEASON 



It is mating time — 
How can I go gipsying? 

It is planting time — 
How can I go adventuring? 

It is harvest time — 

In the twilight the camp-fire smoulders; 

On the hearth-stone 

Ashes hold memories. 

It is dying time — 
And the unknown road. 



ANTAGONISMS 

LAUGHTER 

See! 

I thrust at you laughter — 

Clusters of pomegranate in the sun. 

See! 

I dangle clusters of red sun-ripened laughter 

Before your eyes, that are colorless 

Like the eyes of the fishes. 

What are you peering at, 

Sallow-face? 

Your hand — 

It is limp and clammy; 

It has never clutched at a thing 

Strongly. 

Those pale pinched lips of yours 

Have never blossomed under kisses, 

Have never whispered little words 

Luminous with tenderness. 

Rigid one! 

My laughter. 

Let it shake you like a wind — 

Red wind 

Tearing to shreds 

Your pale hypocrisy. 



My laughter, 

Let it thaw 

Those boulders of black ice — 

Your hard moralities, 

Your bleak utilities — 

And sow violets in their place. 

There is laughter ringing softly 

From the golden shell of the sky. 

There is laughter ringing in the rills 

That come tripping down the bronze and purple hillside 

Insolently. 

Trees are swaying to and fro. 

Laughter in the rustle and the flitter of their leaves. 

And the air is warm and tremulous with laughter 

Rising from the lips that lie 

Mute beneath tombstones. 

Deaf one, 

Listen 

To the scarlet wind! 

There are sobs in the wind. 



INTO THESE THINGS 

The grasp of their hands has grown cold. 
Furnaces needed 
Red fire. 



Their little souls, 

Their cowardly cramped souls — 

Bigness went 

To steel and to stone. 

Slow and feeble their breath. 
Do you hear the white steam 
Panting? 

There is no music in their hearts. 
Engines know rhythm, 
Engines make 
Loudness. 

If their eyes are 
Without longing, 
Do not numbers 
Create themselves? 

And if their lips show not 

The deep proud curve of passion, 

Are not cities 

Passionate? 

Furnaces, steel towers, engines, cities — 

And the pale-eyed people crawling. 

Emptied 

Into these things. 



PASSING 

I am tired of roads. 

I am tired of the going — the going; 

And I am tired of passing people. 

In the east a narrow streak of gold 
And the flutter of wings of the little desires. 
Bleakness of snow in the north 
And in the south the taste of ashes on hot lips. 
Westward a loneliness. 

Roads over sand, and roads over snow, and roads across 
rivers. 

I am tired of roads. 

I am tired of the going — the going; 

And I am tired of passing people. 

I am tired of passing them on the glistening pavements 

under the lamplight 
And in the places where you order things to eat. 
I am tired of passing them at noon under the flat stare of 

the sun 
And in the street-cars, the elevated trains and the taxis. 
Passing glances and feet passing — 
Feet of six million people passing and gliding by, 
Shuflling and jostling by — 
Passing — passing ; 
And those that pass on the screen in the movies, 

And the people that pass — slowly — hurriedly — 
With a half-caught gest through the pages of books. 

I am tired of the winds that hasten by, 

And of the little waves that skip and never once look back, 

And of stars coming and going. 

Fleeting glimpses — 

Hands fluttering past like autumn leaves. . . . 

I am tired of roads. 

I am tired of the going — the going; 

And I am tired of passing people. 



HILL SPEECH 

I listened to the hills as they spoke 
At nightfall. 

I listened to the haughty calm flowing of line speech, 

And to vehement words 

Jagged and bitten into the sky face. 

I saw hieroglyphs scrawled on a pale wall of sky 

With fingers of granite. 

There was motion gripping the masses 

Urging and waving 

Onward. 

I heard cadences of hill speech 



Falling and rising 

Softly, 

With soothing interference. 

And there was one standing alone on the smoldering 

horizon, 
Standing aloof and detached 
Always; 

Saying "I" and "I" and "I," 
Answering "No" and "No" and "No"— 
Always — 

To the biting words and to the flowing line speech, 
And to the hieroglyphs scrawled with fingers of granite. 

There was one 

Saying "No" 

To the dull gray abysses 

Of sky and of sea — 

Saying "No" 

To the masses. . . . 



TWO SONNETS 


She bore the smear of insult on her face, 
And heard the ruffian voices, and the din 
Of penny horns and whistles that had been 

Her heart; a,nd she knew only this disgrace — 

That one had dressed her in a ragged gown. 

Caesar had been met in various ways; 

Like thought too vast to feel or to erase, 
She knew the hosts of Rome were sweeping down 

In various fashions Caesar had been met — 
With crimson violence or more brilliant lies, 

The poisoned fang, or chain of chariot. 

She did not choose, but slain by her surprise, 

She could not see the choice that waited yet — 
The veiled, derisive, plebeian disguise. 

JEST 

In a gutter between wind-bitten glaciers, 
A little man stands, blowing upon a toy. 

Is he not mad — is he not audacious, 
In such a curious place, in such employ.^ 

The wind's blue insult swells upon his face. 
A whisking hunger, like a mouse at bay, 




Has cowed his eyes which, vaguely in disgrace, 
Bear up the heavy menace of Broadway. 

A dim presentiment of an awful hoax 
Scalded his heart and simmered to his feet — 

The secret jest that counted off the strokes 
Of hours men spent at various tasks secrete, 

That made of some of them quite obvious jokes, 
And saved for others labors more discreet. 




ANGUISH 

Pain is cutting through my heart. 

Like a thin knife, 
With the keen abiding smart 

Men call life. 

Pillowed cool in marble state. 

Ah, let me sleep; 
And afar from love or hate 

Bury me deep. 


REFLECTIONS 

DUET 

(/ sing with myself) 
Out of my sorrow 
ril build a stair, 
And every tomorrow 
Will climb to me there; 

With ashes of yesterday 

In its hair. 

My fortune is made 
Of a stab in the side, 
My debts are paid 
In pennies of pride: 

Little red coins 

In a heart I hide. 

The stones that I eat 
Are ripe for my needs; 
My cup is complete 
With the dregs of deeds. 

Clear are the notes 

Of my broken reeds. 

I carry my pack 
Of aches and stings, 
Light with the lack 
Of all good things; 






But not on my tacky 
Because of my wings! 



AT THE HOSPITAL FOR THE INSANE 

They said to me: "We are not crazy, dear! 

But they are mad . . . and so they keep us here." 

I thought: "We are all mad! — in this walled place, 
And out beyond, and through all time and space; 
Save he who looks his madness in the face!" 



SONG OVERHEARD 

I wrote your name within my heart 

Most carefully — 

I never could remember names or faces; 

And then, one day, 

I lost my heart along the shining places. 

I must have let it fall. 

Plucking a flower I did not want 

And listening to a bird I did not see: 

Now would I call — 

And you would answer me. 

Do hearts have wings? 

I am so careless about losing things. 

KIND FATE 

You Strike at hearts of gentle ways; 
And in their grief they give you praise. 

Once, once you struck at me . . . 

And will not strike again. 

You do not like to bruise your hands 

On hearts that hoard their bright hard pain. 

THE STRONGHOLD 

Here he lies 

Under the solemn stones, 

Secure from Life — a little while; 

Old Death, 

With his ready smile, 

Busy among his bones. 

LOOKING ON 

I urged my mind against my will: 
My will shook like a rocking wall, 
But did not fall; 

My mind was like a wind-swept tree, 
And neither knew the victory. 

I dashed my mind against my will: 
They did not break or bend or spill, 
Bqt in my heart the songs grew still. 






A TRUTH ABOUT A LIE 

I lied, trusting you knew 

I could not lie to you. 

Beloved friend, I lied and am forgiven; but I 

Cannot forgive that you believed my lie. 

COUPLETS 

Forest Fires 

Summer is burning! From trees' red crown 
Ashes of June pour hotly down. 

Night of Stars 
They crowded round me more and more; 
I had to shove to shut the door. 

Ascent 

Mountains take too much time. 
Start at the top and climb. 

Reproach 

You gave me wings to fly; 
Then took away my sky. 

Down to the Heights 

In the deep valleys, and deeper still, * 

I found my heights . . . against my will. 


SHADOW SONGS 

LAMENTATION 

Chrysanthemums and late roses 

And the plane-leafs fall — 

All that is left us now. 

Hoarsely the flower-girls cry, 

Pale shake the street-lamp lights; 

Chilled gusts come pufling by, 

Sigh the poor year away. 

All that is left us now 

Regrets without perfume; dead thoughts; 

Chrysanthemums, and late roses. 


VIRGIN MOON 

Having chattered out 

The overbrimming of their light hearts, 

When the old moon had traveled over the housetops 

Far enough to dangle dancing shadows of leaves 

Across their bed, 

Veils of silence also were let down. 

And they slept, virgin beside virgin. 

The whisper of leaves outside the window 

Filled the room 

Long after the moon had trailed 

Her net of shadow-boughs across their dreams 

And was gone. 






AN UNPOSTED LETTER 

How bitter must the smile 
Of the wise Future be 
Behind her veil! 

letter of last year, 
Can my hopes and aims, 

Like moons, 
Have changed so? 
Those dead desires, 
Like shriveled fruits, 
Hang, shamed. 
On the bough of time. 

NOCTURNE 

The veil of light slipped 
From the sky : 
Only greyness. 
And in the valley 
One home light — 
Not mine. 

1 most remember, then. 
Shadows of boughs 
Lattice-wise falling 

On white walls 
Of my home 
Beneath the moon. 


A TRIFOLIATE 

BEAUTY 

Over beauty I am a weeping willow. 

I begged of God to grant me a look at beauty, 

And He sent me traveling a billion years 

To come to this world. 

I came my way an empty vessel, longing for beauty. 

I shall go my way fulfilled, glorifying beauty. 

When I look on beauty 

I secure a day's provision; 

Thus I accumulate food for another billion years. 

When I see beauty 

It propels wheels in me, 

And puts me in communication with God instantly, 

To thank Him that I am arrived. 

My only grief in life is to see a thing without beauty. 
Over beauty I am a weeping willow. 

MY WEDDING 

My adopted little sisty-dreams. 
As soon as they heard 
The wedding news of their brother, 
Shouted: "Brother, our brother. 
You have cared for and sustained us 
All our painful lives. 



For this hour we have been waiting, 

The hour of our culmination. 

Brother, you were betrothed when you were born." 

Then they danced alone to the garden 

To gather star-daisies. 

. Now comes the lady of my heart 
In her purple-bordered, lightning-colored gown. 
The maiden Day, in whom I breathe, comes 
With the sun-bouquet at her breast; 
Led by my sister-dreams, the maids of honor. 
And Life, the best man, leads me to her. 

The pagan musicians Ocean and Wind! 

Ocean the pianist, with jeweled and manicured fingers, 

Thunders and pounds the wide-ranged key-board of the 

shore; 
And the Wind, with hair unbound. 
Holding the violin-woods under her chin. 
Thrills my bride and her maids of honor. 
And Life my best man, 
And me. 

IN YOUR EVES 

To M. //. 
Never before did I dare 
To look in your eyes. 
To see one's self 
In love's mystic eyes 

Is leading 

Life in Paradise. 

(Creator dreamed 

And looked deep in space. 

Then Being, the grace of His dream, 

Began to evolve. 

Thus He became famous, 

And God is His name.) 

When the light from my eyes 

Falls in yours. 

Immortal songs will take course — 

Tuneful songs, the grace of my dreams. 




TRIAD 

In the church of St. PierrCy August, igi8 

Old music wove its beauty through each word 
Which echoed from the chancel down the nave. 

Old beauty of fled twilights stained each beam, 
Carved like the fingers of some soul in prayer. 

A woman veiled in black knelt on the stone. 
The beauty of old suffering on her face. 



A WALKING POEM 

I believe there is moving more than colored jackets 
Down the street among the city rackets. 
I do not think the sun-rain on the corner wall 
Is all. 

I cannot think the swirl is much 

More than a little touch 

Of soulsy to steady to an equipoise 

Their private thunderings, t)ie subterranean noise. 

For I have gathered scowl and elbow-thrust 
And glint of pupil of the eye; there must, 
I think, be lashing foam in canyons under there, 
And this a heavy silence on the little empty air. 

I do not think her ankles mincing through, 
And round smile, are the flowers that we thought we knew. 
Red jacket — stealthy lioness yawning in the wood, 
And stealthy passion creeping in the blood. 

The sun moves, and the colors of the air. 

I think each canyon-river keeps its flowing there 

Within the deepest constancy. 

Call then the sun and jackets pageantry. 



POEMS 

THE LITTLE DEITY ALONE IN THE DESERT 

My life is here 

A contemplation of slow days and distant women. 

Women standing in the sky-line 
As if about to turn into their shawls and leave 
their doorways. 

The illimitable movement of my hand 

Across the desert 

Contrives against their motions and my being. 

LATE WINTER 

The duller plains of dawn 

near this 
Gray 'dobe of bare fruit-trees — 

hesitant 
A foot upon the sill. 


A REQUIEM FOR THE MEMORY OF BEES 

Lake Michigan 
A brown flowering tree 

Was but a farther spinning of 
the sprinkled blackbirds. 



A woman walking. 

The evening dying. 

Her dress among low blossoms. 

Among low blossoms 
Lake water humming. 



CHICAGO SPRING 

Before returning to Santa Fe 

I walk on the streets 
Before nightfall — 
The lake clear and still 
Between young leaves. 

My body is gentle 

As the light on the pavement. 

My fingers play on the air 

Like evening wind running in leaves. 

But there is no one — 
Only return, 

Only old roads of last summer, 
An old fence like dead leaves. 

The hand of God 
Is heavier than mountains. 
It stands on the air 
Like an odor. 


OLD SPRING 

The flowering crabtrees 
Have melted like the twilights. 

Here a brown road 
Dull amid bark shadows 
And an old man walking — 

And between the woods 

The dandelions 

Like dried scattered leaves. 

But in my country 
The spring is old. 
The violet and red 
Are laid in earth, 
Will not be lost. 

And I there, standing, 
Or moving slowly. 

THE SILENT DAYS 

Here men go 

In and out of doors 

And women stand — 

Beneath dry trees 

A child drifts and is still. 



With brevity 

Men break a bitter bread. 

My books 

Are fallen leaves — 

I, unidentified. 

As books passed by at will. 



LAMENT, BESIDE AN ACEQUIA, FOR THE WIFE OF 
AWA-TSIREH 

Two caballeros, 
Smooth in the valley, 
Laughed — their horses bucked. 
The summer foaming. 

San Ildefonso 
In colors 
Faint as dust — 
Flower-dripping dancers — 
One cannot think 
So far away. 

And thinking, 
Women die, 
O Awa-tsireh! 

The faded roads 
May never move. 



"the fragile season' 



The scent of summer thins, 
The air grows cold. 

One walks alone 

And chafes one's hands. 

The fainter aspens 
Thin to air. 

The dawn 
Is frost on roads. 

This ending of the year 
Is like the lacy ending 
of a last year's leaf 
Turned up in silence. 

Air gives way to cold. 






On Translating Chinese Poetry 

at once the work of a sinologue and a poet." They are 
in rhymed verse as direct as Sara Teasdale's lyrics, and 
to me often very beautiful. Here, for instance, is her 
version of one of the odes: 

How say they that the Ho is wide. 
When I could ford it if I tried? 
How say they Sung is far away, 
When I can see it every day? 

Yet must indeed the Ho be deep 
When I have never dared to leap; 
And since I am content to stay, 
Sung must be very far away. 

If one bears in mind the fact that the original is rhymed 
and patterned, does Miss Lowell's new free-verse version, 
with its American colloquialisms, seem an improvement? 

Who says the Ho is wide? 

Why, one little reed can bridge it. 

Who says that Sung is far? 
I stand on tiptoe and see it. 

Who says the Ho is wide? 

Why, the smallest boat cannot enter. 

Who says that Sung is far? 

It takes not a morning to reach it. 

L. Cranmer-Byng, with his A Lute of Jade and A Feast 
of Lanterns y struck a more popular chord, and it is perhaps 
a personal matter that they do not move me as the 
Waddell translations do. They are partially rhymed and 
partially unrhymed. To me it seems that they are not 

quite one thing or the other, neither very good English 
verse nor very scrupulous translations. 

Another interesting, though slightly Latinized, volume 
is Whitall's rendering of the French versions of Judith 
Gautier's Le Liure de Jade. And we have had other 
sorts of translations: the airy snatches of Ezra Pound 
some years ago, who chose a single image that pleased 
him from a long poem and gave us that only; the fantasies 
of E. Powys Mathers, so over-decorated as to be genuinely 
dishonest, the dreadful doggerel of W. A. P. Martin, the 
trite and wearisome mouthings of Charles Budd, not to 
mention the numerous "interpretations." 

Then came Arthur Waley's admirable translations, at 
once so simple and so scholarly, carrying with them an 
instant conviction of authenticity. This, we felt, was 
the substance and spirit of these old poets at last. 

Yet, such is the carping nature of mankind, we no 
sooner had so much than we began to wish for the magic 
also. For Mr. Waley's word sense, excellent as it is, 
still falls short of the ultimate subtlety of magic. It is 
probably with the hope of restoring this magic that Amy 
Lowell with Florence Ayscough, and Witter Bynner 
with Dr. Kiang Kang-hu, have now taken up the work. 
Miss Lowell's book is a welcome addition, since it gives 
us many new and charming poems in a contemporary 
technique. Yet I for one cannot quite trust Miss Lowell. 
She has given us so many racial interpretations — ^Japa- 
nese, Indian and others — which were all essentially herself, 


On Translating Chinese Poetry 

that when I find that this too reads like her own poems 
I doubt their essentially Chinese quality. She has 
surely too vivid a personality to make a good translator. 
Mr. Bynner's book is not yet out, but from the examples 
I have seen it promises to be the most satisfying of the 
free-verse translations in the matter of magic. 

Such, roughly, is the history of the recent attempts 
to translate Chinese classical poetry into English. Let 
me give, for comparison, three different versions of the 
same poem. It is by the Lady Pan Chieh-Yu, chief 
favorite of the emperor who ruled China B. C. 36-32 and 
was sent him with a fan by the lady when she had been 
supplanted by a younger rival. The first translation is 
by Giles, in his history of Chinese literature: 

O fair white silk, fresh from the weaver's loom. 
Clear as the frost, bright as the winter snow — 
See! friendship fashions out of thee a fan. 
Round as the round moon shines in heaven above; 
At home, abroad, a close companion thou. 
Stirring at every move the grateful gale. 
And yet I fear — ah me! — that autumn chills, 
Gx>ling the dying summer's torrid rage, 
Will see thee laid neglected on the shelf. 
All thought of bygone days like them bygone. 



O fan of white silk 

clear as fist on the grass-blade. 
You also are laid aside. 





 

Glazed silk, newly cut, smooth, glittering, white. 

As white, as clear, even as frost and snow. 

Perfectly fashioned into a fan, 

Round, round, like the brilliant moon. 

Treasured in my Lord's sleeve, taken out, put in — 

Wave it, shake it, and a little wind flies from it. 

How often I fear the autumn season's coming. 

And the fierce, cold wind that scatters the blazing heat. 

Discarded, passed by, laid in a box alone; 

Such a little time, and the thing of love cast off.  Poems by Rodney Jones 
 
 
ON THE BEARING OF WAITRESSES

 Always I thought they suffered, the way they huffed 
through the Benzedrine light of waffle houses, 
hustling trays of omelets, gossiping by the grill, 
or pruning passes like the too prodigal buds of roses, 
and I imagined each come home to a trailer court, 
the yard of bricked-in violets, the younger sister 
pregnant and petulant at her manicure, the mother 
with her white Bible, the father sullen in his corner. 
Wasn’t that the code they telegraphed in smirks? 
And wasn’t this disgrace, to be public and obliged, 
observed like germs or despots about to be debunked?  Unlikely brides, apostles in the gospel of stereotypes, 
their future was out there beyond the parked trucks, 
between the beer joints and the sexless church, 
the images we’d learned from hayseed troubadours— perfume, grease, and the rending of polarizing loves. 

But here in this men’s place, they preserved a faint 
decorum of women and, when they had shuffled past us, 
settled in that realm where the brain approximates 
names and rounds off the figures under uniforms. 
Not to be honored or despised, but to walk as spies would, 
with almost alien poise in the imperium of our disregard, 
to go on steadily, even on the night of the miscarriage, 
to glide, quick smile, at the periphery of appetite. 
And always I had seen them listening, as time brought 
and sent them, hovering and pivoting as the late 
orders turned strange, blue garden, brown wave. Spit 
in the salad, wet sucks wrung into soup, and this happened. 
One Sunday morning in a truckstop in Bristol, Virginia, 
a rouged and pancaked half-Filipino waitress 
with hair dyed the color of puffed wheat and mulberries 
singled me out of the crowd of would-be bikers 
and drunken husbands guzzling coffee to sober up 
in time to cart their disgusted wives and children 
down the long street to the First Methodist Church. 
Because I had a face she trusted, she had me wait 
that last tatter of unlawful night that hung there 
and hung there like some cast-off underthing 
caught on the spikes of a cemetery’s wrought-iron fence. 
And what I had waited for was no charm of flesh, 
not the hard seasoning of luck, or work, or desire, b
ut all morning, in the sericea by the filthy city lake, 
I suffered her frightened lie, how she was wanted 
in Washington by the CIA, in Vegas by the FBI— while time shook us like locks that would not break. 
And I did not speak, though she kept pausing to look 
back across one shoulder, as though she were needed 
in the trees, but waxing her slow paragraphs into 
chapters, filling the air with her glamour and her shame.    


WHERE I WAS A KING 
Maybe a sin, indecent for sure--dope, 
The storekeeper called it. Everyone agreed 
That Manuel Lawrence, who drank 
Through the side of his mouth, squinting 
And chortling with pleasure, was hooked; 
Furthermore, Aunt Brenda, 
Who was so religious that she made 
Her daughters bathe with their panties on, 
Had dubbed it "toy likker, fool thing," 
And so might I be. Holding the bottle 
Out to the light, watching it bristle. 
Watching the slow spume of bubbles  
Die, I asked myself, could it be alive?

When they electrocuted Edwin Dockery, H
e sat there like a steaming, breathing 
Bolt, the green muscles in his arms 
Strained at the chair's black straps, 
The little finger of his right hand leapt up, 
But the charge rose, the four minutes 
And twenty-five hundred volts of his death, 
Which in another month will be 
Thirty-five years old. So the drink fizzed 
With the promise of mixtures to come.

There it was. If the Hard-Shell 
Baptists of Alabama are good and content 
That the monster has died, so am I. 
I swallowed. Sweet darkness, one thing 
Led to another, the usual life, waking 
Sometimes lost, dried blood in the ear, 
Police gabbling in a strange language. 
How else would I ever gauge 
How pleasure might end, walking 
Past midnight in the vague direction 
Of music? I am never satisfied.
 


Brains 
When I moved in with her, I thought now 
I won't have to look it up: rubidium, Calvin Trillin, the fourth- longest river in Brazil. 
The lunar mountain ranges 
zoomed in. Zygotes and paramecia 
made themselves known. She 
could cook a mean boeuf bourguignon, 
then rank the leading authorities 
on the aspiration of the h 
or mystical tenses of Latin verbs. 
But you are so creative, there's 
not a creative bone in my body, 
she would say, when I insisted 
before friends we had recently met 
that not I but she was the brain. 
Now that she is gone, 
now I can feel secure, one 
of my thoughts sending another 
down through the foggy 
databases, the fractures, 
and the unions. Here boy, 
I whistle to the dog of my thoughts. 
I am thinking how, 
before I lived with her, 
I was known as the brain, 
but I valued the heart more than the brain, 
and more than the heart, the flag of the erogenous zones— 
loving me was like patriotism, 
but I was not fit to live with her. 
I knew, when she began to chant 
and burn incense to the Asian saints,  I did not know her secret anything. 
Still, I had ideas, insights, 
a brain like the world's mute, 
lightning-soldered, accidental 
intelligence. With that same brain now I hold our ill-starred, 
incompatible visions 
of happiness and tragedy. 
Yet when I need to know 
how spinnerets work 
or the distance to Alpha Centauri, 
I think of her, not for long 
or at any depth, or what 
she was, but the last 
compliment that means anything 
is the compliment to memory.
 

The Language of Love 
 
It has taken thirty-five years to be this confident 
of what happens between the noun and the verb. 

Eventually, love goes. The image. Then the thought. 
No? Then you are still alive. Only a little. And then,

I do not mean to depress you. Men have to hear 
before they see. Sacred vows. Dropped shirts.

Women do not speak to men. They are overheard.  Sadness mounts people. Around the burn-scar high

on one thigh, the body of the beloved will vanish. 
And the come cries and salt hair-smells of lovemaking.

Secret fiction, holy matrimony, longest short story 
the troth two lovers pledge to one another is none

of the president’s business, let him say what he wants.  
He is no good with words. Ask any true lesbian.

He should take a poetry workshop with Adrienne Rich. 
He should try using the world less and words more
  

 THE BRIDGE

 These fulsome nouns, these abbreviations of air, 
Are not real, but two of them may fit a small man 
I knew in high school who, seeing an accident, 
Stopped one day, leapt over a mangled guardrail, 
Took a mother and two children from a flooded creek, 
And lifted them back to the world. In the dark, 
I do not know, there is a saying, but he pulled 
Them each up a tree, which was not the tree of life 
But a stooped Alabama willow, flew three times 
From the edge of that narrow bridge as though 
From the selfless shore of a miracle, and came back 
To the false name of a real man, Arthur Peavahouse. 
He could sink a set shot from thirty feet. One night 
I watched him field a punt and scat behind a wall 
Of blockers like a butterfly hovering an outhouse. He did not love the crashing of bodies. He 
Did not know that mother and her three children 
But went down one huge breath to their darkness. 
There is no name for that place, you cannot 
Find them following a white chain of bubbles 
Down the muddy water of these words. But I saw 
Where the rail sheared from the bridge—which is 
Not real since it was replaced by a wider bridge. 
Arthur Peavahouse weighed a hundred and twenty pounds. 
Because he ran well in the broken field, men 
Said he was afraid. I remember him best 
At a laboratory table, holding a test tube 
Up to the light, arranging equations like facts, 
But the school is air over a parking lot. You 
Are too far from that valley for it to come 
All the way true, although it is not real. 
Not two miles from that bridge, one afternoon 
In March, in 1967, one of my great-uncles, 
Clyde Maples, a farmer and a commissioner of roads, 
And his neighbor, whose name I have forgotten, 
Pulled more than a hundred crappies off three 
Stickups in that creek—though the creek is not 
Real and the valley is a valley of words. You  Would need Clyde Maples to find Arthur Peavahouse, 
And you would need Clyde Maples’ side yard 
Of roadgraders and bulldozers to get even part 
Of Clyde Maples, need him like the crappies 
Needed those stickups in the creek to tell them 
Where they were. Every spring that creek 
Darkens with the runoff of hog lots and barns, 
Spreading sloughs, obscuring sorghum and corn. 
On blind backwater full schoolbuses roll 
Down buried roads. Arthur Peavahouse was smart 
To run from the huge tackles and unthinking 
To throw himself into that roiling water 
And test the reality of his arms and lungs. 
Many times I have thought everything I said 
Or thought was a lie, moving some blame or credit 
By changing a name, even the color of a lip or bush, 
But whenever I think of the lie that stands for truth, 
I think of Arthur Peavahouse, and not his good name, 
But his deciding, as that car settled to the bottom, 
To break free and live for at least one more moment 
Upward toward light and the country of words 
While the other child, the one he could not save, 
Shrugged behind him in the unbreakable harness.  


 GROUND SENSE

 Because I have known many women 
Who are dead, I try to think of fields 
As holy places. Whether we plow them

Or let them to weeds and sunlight, 
Those are the best places for grief, 
If only that they perform the peace

We come to, the feeling without fingers, 
The hearing without ears, the seeing 
Without eyes. Isn’t heaven just this

Unbearable presence under leaves? 
I had thought so. I had believed 
At times in a meadow and at other

Times in a wood where we’d emerge 
No longer ourselves, but reduced 
To many small things that we could

Not presume to know, except as my  
Friend’s wife begins to disappear, 
He feels no solvent in all the earth,

And me, far off, still amateur at grief. 
Walking the creek behind the house, 
I cross to the old homeplace, find

A scattering of chimney rocks, the 
Seeds my grandmother watered, the 
Human lifetime of middle-aged trees.  


 A DEFENSE OF POETRY

 If abstract identity, philosophy’s silhouette, authorless, quoted, 
and italicized, governs by committee the moments 
of a mutinying, multitudinous self, then I’m lost.

But let a semi loaded with bridge girders come barreling 
down on me, I’m in a nanosecond propelled 
into the singular, fleet and unequivocal as a deer’s thought.

As to the relevance of poetry in our time, I delay and listen 
to the distances: John Fahey’s “West Coast Blues,” a truck 
backing up, hammers, crows in their perennial discussion of moles.

My rage began at forty. The unstirred person, the third-person 
void, the you of accusations and reprisals, visited me.  
Many nights we sang together; you don’t even exist.

In print, a little later is the closest we come to now: the turn 
in the line ahead and behind; the voice, slower than the brain; 
and the brain, slower than the black chanterelle.

The first time I left the South I thought I sighted 
in an Indiana truckstop both Anne Sexton 
and John Frederick Nims, but poetry makes a little dent like a dart.

It’s the solo most hold inside the breath as indigestible truth. 
For backup singers, there’s the mumbling of the absolutes. 
Du-bop of rain and kinking heat. La-la of oblivion.

Sheep-bleat and stone-shift and pack-choir. 
There is a sense beyond words that runs through them: 
animal evidence like fur in a fence, especially valuable now,

self-visited as we are, self-celebrated, self-ameliorated, 
and self-sustained, with the very kit of our inner weathers, 
with migraine, our pain du jour, our bread of suffering.

If poetry is no good to you, why pretend it can enlighten you? 
Why trouble the things you have heard or seen written 
when you can look at the mandrone tree?
 

BEAUTIFUL CHILD 

Because I looked out as I was looked upon 
(Blue-eyed under the golden corm of ringlets 
That my mother could not bring herself 
To have the barber shear from my head) 
I began to see, as adults approached me, 
That hunger a young woman must feel 
When a lover seizes one breast too long 
On the ideal nipple-balm of the tongue. 
When they lifted me and launched me 
Ceilingward, I seemed to hang there years, 
A satellite in the orbit of their affections, 
Spinning near the rainspot continents 
And the light globe freckled with flies. 
I could smell the week-old syrupy sweat 
And the kerosene of many colognes, 
Could see the veined eyes and the teeth 
Dotted with shreds of lettuce and meat. 
When I touched down, one of them 
Would hold me to the torch of a beard 
And goose my underarms until I screamed. 
Another would rescue me, but leave 
On my cheek the heart-mark of her kiss. 
So I began, at three, to push them away. 
There was no ceremony and few words, 
But like a woman who has let a man go too far 
And, in one night's moodiness, steps
 Out of a parked car and walks home alone, 
I came suddenly to my life, and they  
Did not begrudge me, but turned back 
To the things they had done before-- 
The squeaking bed, the voices late at night. 
Mornings I'd crawl beneath the house, Dreaming how poignantly tragic my death 
Would seem, but, having thought about it, 
I happily took myself into the darkness 
Of the underground, where I was king.
 
 

THE BOOMERS TAKE THE FIELD

It takes a long time to forgive 
heroism or beauty. 
And then the young girl 
in the old song owns a plot 
in the memorial gardens, 
a brow full of Botox, 
and a lover with Viagra.

The laps of the mythical 
parents of World War Two 
and the Great Depression 
have lithified to granite, 
yet we remain childish. 
In our fifties, we study ourselves 
studying their violence.

Do they forgive us our graduations? 
They got dark early— 
so elegant in photographs, 
but thin from hunger 
as often as vanity. 
We were lucky, they said. 
We should have lived in the thirties.

No one could find a kid. 
Occasionally they'd find 
a little person and beat it 
for impersonating a kid. 
And if it cried, 
they'd beat it again, harder, 
and give it a pair of Lucky Strikes



 
THE STATE-LINE STRIPPER 
I got lost. 
At a family picnic for the employees 
of Martha White Self-Rising Flour. 

Two lovers found me down by the Tennessee River, 
a little fat girl 
crying into the lichen on a stone's face, 
and took me to the grandstand—

Embarrassing— I got lost. And then I lost my fear. 
Strangers and high places 
and nightly publishing myself 
naked except for a fireman's hat. 
I danced and Jehovah's Witnesses 
came unglued in the parking lot.

My creation was like the earth's. 
In the beginning there was shame, 
then the body after shame, 
dangerous happiness— 
If I could remember how I got here 
I wouldn't be lost.

Yet my body recommends me. 
All that I promised that I would not do, I did. 
I got over my fear of darkness 
when it seemed to me anything out there 
would probably be better 
than what shone here in the light
 Even though the greatest boon a poet grants the world is 
to reveal that secret and sacred presence, they will not 
know what he is talking about. Surgery cannot assist him, 
nor cures. The surgeon must himself know that his sur- 
gery is idle. But the object of this continuous scribbling 
comes to him also, I can see by his eyes that he acknowl- 
edges it. 

That is why I started to write Paterson: a man is indeed 
a city, and for the poet there are no ideas but in things. 
But the critics would have it that I, the 

fecting to write poems in their very zeal as 
all depends on what you call profound. For I acknowl- 
edge it would, in dealing with man and city, require one 
to go to some depth in the form for the purpose. 

The thinkers, the scholars, thereupon propound ques- 
tions upon the nature of verse, answering themselves or 
at least creating tension between thoughts. They think, 
and to think, they believe, is to be profound. A curious 
idea, if what they think is profitable to their thinking 
they are rewarded — as thinkers. 

But who, if he chose, could not touch the bottom of 
thought? The poet does not, however, permit himself to 
go beyond the thought to be discovered in the context of 




that with which he is dealing: no ideas but in things. The 
poet thinks with his poem, in that lies his thought, and 
that in itself is the profundity. The thought is Paterson, 
to be discovered there. 

Therefore the thinker tries to capture the poem for his 
purpose, using his "thought" as the net to put his thoughts 
into. Absurd. They are not profound enough to discover 
that by this they commit a philosophic solecism. They 
have jumped the track, slipped out of category; no matter 
what the thought or the value, the poem will be bad, to 
make a pigeon roar. 

The first idea centering upon the poem, Paterson, came 
alive early: to find an image large enough to embody the 
whole knowable world about me. The longer I lived in 
my place, among the details of my life, I realized that 
these isolated observations and experiences needed pulling 

\ together to gain "profundity." I already had the river. 

Flossie is always astonished when she realizes that we live 
on a river, that we are a river town. New York Qty was 
far out of my perspective; I wanted, if I was to write in 

Ka larger way than of the birds and flowers, to write about 
the people close about me: to know in detail, minutely 

v what I was talking about — to the whites of their eyes, 

, their very smells. 

r That is the poet's business. Not to talk in vague cate- 
gories but to write particularly, as a physician works, 
upon a patient, upon the thing before him, in the partic- 
5$fer to discover the universal. John Dewey had said (I dis- 
covered it quite by chance), "The local is the only uni- 
versal, upon that all art builds." Keyserling had said the 
|||aane in different words. I had no wish, nor did I have 
ipfe opportunity to know New York in that way, and I 
Ijfclt no loss in that. 

P I thought of other places upon the Passaic River, but, 
f in the end, the city, Paterson, with its rich colonial his- 
tory, upstream, where the water was less heavily polluted, 
k won out. The falls, vocal, seasonally vociferous, associated 




with many of the ideas upon which our fiscal 
policy shaped us through Alexander Hamilton, interested 
me profoundly — and, what has resulted the* 
today a fruitful locale for study. I 
I had heard, I had taken part in some of the incidents that 
made up the place. I had heard Billy Sunday: I had talked 
With John* Reed: I had in my hospital experiences got to 
know many of the women: I had tramped Garret Moun- 
tain as a youngster, swum in its ponds, appeared in court 
there, looked at its charred ruins, its flooded streets, read 
of its past in Nelson's history of Paterson, read of the 




my "case" to work up, really to work 
it up. It called for a poetry such as I did not know, it was 
my duty to discover or make such a context on the 
"thought." To make a poem, fulfilling the requirements 
of the art, and yet new, in the sense that in the very lay 
of the syllables Paterson as Paterson would be discovered, 
perfect, perfect in the special sense of the poem, to have 
to flutter into life awhile — it would be as it- 
so like every other place in the world. 
For it is in that, that it be particular to its own idiom, 
that it lives. r 

The Falls let out a roar as it crashed upon thft rocks 
at its base. In the imagination this roar is a speech or a 
voice, a speech in particular; it is the poem itself that is 
the answer. 
In the end the man rises 





inland toward Camden where Walt Whitman, much tra- 
duced, lived the latter years of his life and died* He al- 
ways said that his poems, which had broken the domi- 
nance of the iambic pentameter in English prosody, had 
only begun his theme. I agree- It is up to us, in the new 
dialect, to continue it by a new construction upon the 



Book One 




: a local pride; spring, summer, fall and the sea; a confes- 
sion; a basket; a column; a reply to Greek and Latin with 
the hare hands; a gathering up; a celebration; 

in distinctive terms; by multiplication a reduction to 
one; daring; a fall; the clouds resolved into a sandy sluice; 
an enforced pause; 

hard put to it; an identification and a plan for action 
to supplant a plan for action; a taking up of slack; a dis-

Paterson 



Preface 

"Rigor of beauty is the quest. But how will you find beauty 
when it is locked in the mind past all remonstrance?" 

To make a start, 

put of particulars 

and make them general, rolling 

up the sum, by defective means — 

Sniffing the trees, 

just another dog 

among a lot of dogs. What 

else is there? And to do? 

The .rest-have run out — 

after the rabbits. 

Only the lame stands— on 

three legs. Scratch front and back. 

Deceive and eat. Dig 

a musty bone 

- 

For the beginning is assuredly 

the end — since we know nothing, pure 

and simple, beyond 

our own complexities. 

Yet there is 
no return: rolling up out of chaos, 
a nine months' wonder, the city 
the man, an identity — it can't be 
otherwise — an 

interpenetration, both ways. Rolling 




up! obverse, reverse; 

the drunk the sober; the illustrious 

the gross; one. In ignorance 

a certain knowledge and knowledge, 

undispersed, its own undoing. 

(The multiple seed, 
packed tight with detail, soured, 
is lost in the flux and the mind, 
distracted, floats off in the same 
scum) 

Rolling up, rolling up heavy with 
numbers. 

It is the ignorant sun 
rising in the slot of 
hollow suns risen, so that never in this 
world will a man live well in his body 
save dying — and not know himself 
dying; yet that is 
the design. Renews himself 
thereby, in addition and subtraction, 
walking up and down. 

and the craft, 
subverted by thought, rolling up, let 
him beware lest he turn to no more than 
the writing of stale poems . . . 
Minds like beds always made up, 

(more stony than a shore) 
unwilling or unable. 



Rolling in, top up, 
under, thrust and recoil, a great clatter: 
lifted as air, boated, multicolored, a 
wash of seas — 

from mathematics to particulars- 
divided as the dew, 
floating mists, to be rained down and 
regathered into a river that flows 
and encircles: 

shells and animalcules 
generally and so to man, 



to Paterson. 



The Delineaments of the Giants 



I 



Paterson lies in the valley under the Passaic Falls 
its spent waters forming the outline of his back. He 
lies on his right side, head near the thunder 
of the waters filling his dreams! Eternally asleep, 
his dreams walk about the city where he persists 
incognito. Butterflies settle on his stone ear. 
Immortal he-neither moves nor rouses and is seldom 
seen, though he breathes and the subtleties of his 
machinations 

drawing their substance from the noise of the pouring 
river 

animate a thousand automatons. Who because they 
neither know their sources nor the sills of their 
disappointments walk outside their bodies aimlessly 

for the most part, 
locked and forgot in their desires — unroused. 

— Say it, no ideas but in things- 
nothing but the blank faces of the houses 
and cylindrical trees 

bent, forked by preconception and accident- 
split, furrowed, creased, mottled, stained — 
secret— into the body of the light! 

From above, higher than the spires, higher 
even than the office towers, from oozy fields 
abandoned to grey beds of dead grass, 
black sumac, withered weed-stalks, 
mud and thickets cluttered with dead leaves — 



6 



the river comes pouring in above the city 
and crashes from the edge of the gorge 
in a recoil of spray and rainbow mists— 

(What common language to unravel? 

. . combed into straight lines 
from that rafter of a rock's 

lip.) 

A man like a city and a woman like a 
— who are in love. Two women. Three women. 
Innumerable women, each like a flower. 

But 

only one man— like a city. 

In regard to the poems I left with you; will you be so kind as to 
return them to me at my new address? And without bothering to 
comment upon them if you should find that embarrassing — for it 
was the human situation and not the literary one that motivated 
my phone call and visit. 

Besides, I know myself to be more the woman than the poet; and 
to concern myself less with the publishers of poetry than with . . « 
living ... 

But they set up an investigation . . . and my doors are bolted 
forever (I hope forever) against all public welfare workers, profes- 
sional do-gooders and the like. 

Jostled as are the waters approaching 
the brink, his thoughts 
interlace, repel and cut under, 
rise rock-thwarted and turn aside 
but forever strain forward — or strike 
an eddy and whirl, marked by a 
leaf or curdy spume, seeming 
to forget 

Retake later the advance and 

are replaced by succeeding hordes 



pushing forward— they coalesce now 

glass-smooth with their swiftness, 

quiet or seem to quiet as at the close 

they leap to the conclusion and 

fall, fall in air! as if 

floating, relieved of their weight, 

split apart, ribbons; dazed, drunk 

with the catastrophe of the descent 

floating unsupported 

to hit the rocks: to a thunder, 

as if lightning had struck 

All lightness lost, weight regained in 
the repulse, a fury of 
escape driving them to rebound 
upon those coming after- 
keeping nevertheless to the stream, they 
retake their course, the air full 
of the tumult and of spray 
connotative of the equal air, coeval, 
filling the void 

And there, against him, stretches the low mountain. 

The Park's her head, carved, above the Falls, by the quiet 

river; Colored^ crystals the secret of those rocks; 

farms and ponds, laurel and the temperate wild cactus, 

yellow flowered . . facing him, his 

arm supporting her, by the Valley of the Rocks, asleep. 

Pearls at her ankles, her monstrous hair 

spangled with apple-blossoms is scattered about into 

the back country, waking their dreams — where the deer run 

and the wood-duck nests protecting his gallant plumage* 

In February 7, David Hower, a poor shoemaker with a large 
family, out of work and money, collected a lot of mussels from 
Notch Brook near the City of Paterson* He found in eating them 



many hard substances. At first he threw them away but at last sub- 
mitted some of them to a jeweler who gave him twenty-five to 
thirty dollars for the lot. Later he found others. One pearl of fine 
lustre was sold to Tiffany for $ and later to the Empress Eugenie 
for $2, to be known thenceforth as the "Queen Pearl/* the finest 
of its sort in the world today. 

News of this sale created such excitement that search for the 
pearls was started throughout the country. The Unios (mussels) at 
Notch Brook and elsewhere were gathered by the millions and 
destroyed often with little or no result. A large round pearl, weigh- 
ing  grains which would have been the finest pearl of modern 
times, was ruined by boiling open the shell. 

Twice a month Paterson receives 
communications from the Pope and Jacques 

Barzun 
(Isocrates). His works 
have been done into French 
and Portuguese. And clerks in the post- 
office ungum rare stamps from 
his packages and steal them for their 
childrens' albums 

Say it! No ideas but in things. Air. 
Paterson has gone away 
to rest and write. Inside the bus one sees 
his thoughts sitting and standing. His 
thoughts alight and scatter — 

Who are these people (how complex 

the mathematic) among whom I see myself 

in the regularly ordered plateglass of 

his thoughts, glimmering before shoes and bicycles? 

They walk incommunicado, the 

equation is beyond solution, yet 

its sense is clear — that they may live 

his thought is listed in the Telephone 

Directory- 



And derivatively, for the Great Falls, 
PISS- AGH! the giant lets fly! good Muncie, too 

They craved the miraculous! 

A gentleman of the Revolutionary Army, after describing the 
Falls, thus describes another natural curiosity then existing in the 
community: In the afternoon we were invited to visit another curi- 
osity in the neighborhood. This is a monster in human form, he is 
twenty-seven years of age, his face from the upper part of his fore- 
head to the end of his chin, measures twenty-seven inches, and 
around the upper part of his head is twenty-one inches: his eyes 
and nose are remarkably large and prominent, chin long and 
pointed. His features are coarse, irregular and disgusting, his voice 
rough and sonorous. His body is twenty-seven inches in length, his 
limbs are small and much deformed, and he has the use of one 
hand only. He has never been able to sit up, as he cannot support 
the enormous weight of his head; but he is constantly in a large 
cradle, with his head supported in pillows. He is visited by great 
numbers of people, and is peculiarly fond of the company of clergy- 
men, always inquiring for them among his visitors, and taking great 
pleasure in receiving religious instruction. General Washington 
made him a visit, and asked "whether he was a Whig or a Tory." 
He replied that he had never taken an active part on either side. 

A wonder! A wonder! 

From the ten houses Hamilton saw when he looked (at the falls! ) 
and kept his counsel, by the middle of the century — the mills had 
drawn a heterogeneous population. There were in 0, native born 
,, which would of course include children of foreign parents; 
foreign , of whom  were French, 0 German, 3, 
English — (Mr. Lambert who later built thqi Castle among them), 
5, Irish,  Scotch, 1, Hollanders and  Swiss — 

Around the falling waters the Furies hurl! 
Violence gathers, spins in their heads summoning 
them: 

The twaalft, or striped bass was also abundant, and even sturgeon, 
of a huge bigness, were frequently caught: — On Sunday, August 


one seven feet six inches long, and weighing  pounds, 
was captured a short distance below the Falls basin. He was pelted 
with stones by boys until he was exhausted, whereupon one of them, 
John Winters, waded into the water and clambered on the back of 
the huge fish, while another seized him by the throat and gills, and 

brought him ashore. The Berzen Express and Paterson Advertiser 
of YVednesday, September 3,  7, devoted half a column to an 

account of the incident, under the heading, "The Monster Taken," 

They begin! 
The perfections are sharpened 
The flower spreads its colored petals 

wide in the sun 
But the tongue of the bee 

misses them 
They sink back into the loam 

crying out 
— you may call it a cry 
that creeps over them, a shiver 

* as they wilt and disappear: 
Marriage come to have a shuddering 

implication 

Crying out 
or take a lesser satisfaction: 

a few go 
to the Coast without gain — 
The language is missing them 

they die also 

incommunicado. 

The language, the language 

fails, them 
They do not know the words 

or have not 
the courage to use them 

— girls from 




families that have decayed and 
taken to the hills: no words. » 

They may look at the torrent in 

their minds 

and it is foreign to them. . 

They turn their backs 

and grow faint — but recover! 

Life is sweet 
they say: the language! 

— the language 
is divorced from their minds, 
the language . * the language! 

If there was not beauty, there was a strangeness and a bold as- 
sociation of wild and cultured life grew up together in the Ra- 
mapos: two phases. 

In the hills, where the brown trout slithered among the shallow 
stones, Ringwood — where the old Ryerson farm had been — among 
its velvet lawns, was ringed with forest trees, the butternut, and 
the elm, the white oak, the chestnut and the beech, the birches, the 
tupelo, the sweet-gum, the wild cherry and the hackleberry with its 
red tumbling fruit. 

While in the forest clustered the ironworkers' cabins, the char- 
coal burners, the lime kiln workers — hidden from lovely Ringwood 
— where General Washington, gracing any poem, up from Pomp- 
ton for rest after the traitors' hangings could be at ease — and the 
links were made for the great chain across the Hudson at West 
Point. 

Violence broke out in Tennessee, a massacre by the Indians, hang- 
ings and exile — standing there on the scaffold waiting, sixty of them. 
The Tuscaroras, forced to leave their country, were invited'by the 
Six Nations to join them in Upper New York. The bucks went on 
ahead but some of the women and the stragglers got no further than 
the valley-cleft near Suffern. They took to the mountains there 
where they were joined by Hessian deserters from the British 
Army, a number of albinos among them, escaped negro slaves and 

a lot of women and their brats released in New York City after die 
British had been forced to leave. They had them in a pen there- 
picked up in Liverpool and elsewhere by a man named Jackson 




tinder contract with the British Government to provide women 
for the soldiers in America* 

The mixture ran in the woods and took the general name, Jack- 
jon's Whites. (There had been some blacks also, mixed in, some 
"West Indian negresses, a ship-load, to replace the whites lost when 
their ship, one of six coming from England, had foundered in a 
Storm at sea. He had to make it up somehow and that was the 
quickest and cheapest way.) 

New Barbadoes Neck, the region was called. 

Cromwell, in the middle of the seventeenth century, shipped some 
thousands of Irish women and children to the Barbadoes to be sold 
as slaves. Forced by their owners to mate with the others these un- 
fortunates were succeeded by a few generations of Irish-speaking 
negroes and mulattoes. And it is commonly asserted to this day the 
natives of Barbadoes speak with an Irish brogue. 

I remember 
a Geographic picture, the 9 women 
of some African chief semi-naked 
astraddle a log, an official log to 
be presumed, heads left: 

Foremost 
froze the young and latest, 
erect, a proud queen, conscious of her power, 
mud-caked, her monumental hair 
slanted above the brows — violently frowning. 

Behind her, packed tight up 
in a descending scale of freshness 
stiffened the others 

and then . * 
the last, the first wife, 
present! supporting all the rest growing 
up from her — whose careworn eyes 
serious, menacing — but unabashed; breasts 
sagging from hard use . . 




Whereas the uppointed breasts 
of that other, tense, charged with 
pressures unrelieved 
and the rekindling they bespoke 
was evident. 

Not that the lightnings 
do not stab at the mystery of a man 
from both ends — and the middle, no matter 
how much a chief he may be, rather the more 
because of it, to destroy him at home 

Womanlike, a vague smile, 
unattached, floating like a pigeon 
after a long flight to his cote. 

Mrs. Sarah Cumming, consort of the Rev. Hopper Gumming, of 
Newark, was a daughter of the late Mr. John Emmons, of Pordand, 
in the district of Maine. . . . She had been married about two 
months, and was blessed with a flattering prospect of no common 
share of Temporal felicity and usefulness in the sphere which 
Providence had assigned her; but oh, how uncertain is the contin- 
uance of every earthly joy. 

On Saturday, the th of June, 2, the Rev. Gumming rode 
with his wife to Paterson, in order to supply, by presbyterial ap- 
pointment, a destitute congregation in that place, on the following 
day. . . . On Monday morning, he went with his beloved com- 
panion to show her the falls of the Passaic, and the surrounding 
beautiful, wild and romantic scenery, — little expecting the solemn 
event to ensue. 

Having ascended the flight of stairs (the Hundred Steps) Mr. and 
Mrs. Cumming walked over the solid ledge to the vicinity of the 
cataract, charmed with the wonderful prospect, and making various 
remarks upon the stupendous works of nature around them. At 
length they took their station on the brow of the solid rock, which 
overhangs the basin, six or eight rods from the falling water, where 
thousands have stood before, and where there is a fine view of die 
sublime curiosities of the place. When they had enjoyed the luxury 
of the scene for a considerable length of time, Mr. Cumming said, 
"My dear, I believe it is time for us to set our face homeward"; and 
at the same moment, turned round in order to lead the way. He 




instantly heard the voice of distress, looked back and his wife was 
gone! 

Mr. Cummirig's sensations on the distressing occasion may, in 
8$me measure, be conceived, but they cannot be described. He was 
on the borders of distraction, and, scarcely knowing what he did, 
would have plunged into the abyss, had it not been kindly ordered 
in providence that a young man should be near, who instantly flew 
to him, like a guardian angel, and held him from a step which his 
reason, at the time, could not have prevented. This young man led 
him from the precipice, and conducted him to the ground below the 
stairs. Mr. Cumming forced himself out of the hands of bis pro- 
tector, and ran with violence, in order to leap into the fatal flood. 
His young friend, however, caught him once more. . . . Immediate 
search was made, and diligently continued throughout the day, for 
the body of Mrs. Cumming; but to no purpose. On the following 
morning, her mortal part was found in a depth of  feet, and, the 
same day, was conveyed to Newark. 

A false language. A true. A false language pouring— a 
language (misunderstood) pouring (misinterpreted) without 
dignity, without minister, crashing upon a stone ear. At least 
it settled it for her. Patch too, as a matter of fact. He 
became a national hero in ', ' and toured the country 
diving from cliffs and masts, rocks and bridges — to prove his 
thesis: Some things can be done as well as others. 



THE GRRRREAT HISTORY of that 

old time Jersey Patriot 

N. F. PATERSON! 

(N for Noah; F for Faitoute; P for short) 
"Jersey Lightning" to the boys. 

So far everything had gone smoothly. The pulley and ropes were 
tecurely fastened on each side of the chasm, and everything made 
in readiness to pull the clumsy bridge into position. It was a wooden 




structure boarded up on both sides, and a roof . It was about two 
o'clock in the afternoon and a large crowd had gathered — a large 
crowd for that time, as the town only numbered about four thou- 
sand—to watch the bridge placed in position. 

That day was a great day for old Paterson. It being Saturday, the 
mills were shut down, so to give the people a chance to celebrate* 
Among those who came in for a good part of the celebration was 
Sam Patch, then a resident in Paterson, who was a boss over cotton 
spinners in one of the mills* He was my boss, and many a time he 
gave me a cuff over the ears. 

Well, this day the constables were on the look for Patch, because 
they thought he would be on a spree and cause trouble. Patch had 
declared so frequently that he would jump from the rocks that he 
was placed under arrest at various times. He had previously been 
locked up in the basement under the bank with a bad case of de- 
lirium tremens, but on the day the bridge was pulled across the 
chasm he was let out. Some thought he was crazy. They were not 
far wrong. 

But the happiest man in the town that day was Timothy B. Crane, 
who had charge of the bridge. Tim Crane was a hotel keeper and 
kept a tavern on the Manchester side of the Falls. His place was a 
great resort for circus men. Such famous circus men of the long 
ago as Dan Rice and James Cooke, the great bareback rider, visited 
him. 

Tim Crane built the bridge because his rival, Fyfield, who kept 
the tavern on the other side of the falls, was getting the benefit of 
the "Jacob's Ladder," as it was sometimes called — the "hundred 
steps," a long, rustic, winding stairs in the gorge leading to the 
opposite side of the river — it making his, place more easy to get 
to. . . . Crane was a very robust man over six feet tall. He wore 
side whiskers. He was well known to the other citizens as a man of 
much energy and no little ability. In his manner he resembled the 
large, rugged stature of Sam Patch. 

When the word was given to haul the bridge across the chasm, 
the crowd rent the air with cheers. But they had only pulled it half 
way over when one of the roiling pins slid from the ropes into the 
water below. 

While all were expecting to see the big, clumsy bridge topple 
over and land in the chasm, as quick as a flash a form leaped out 
from the highest point and struck with a splash in the dark water 
below, swam to the wooden pin and brought it ashore. This was 
the starting point of Sam Patch's career as a famous jumper. I saw 
that, said the old man with satisfaction, and I don't believe there is 




another person in the town today who was an eye-witness of that 
scene. These were the words that Sam Patch said: "Now, old Tim 
Crane thinks he has done something great, but I can beat him." As he 
spoke he jumped. 

There's no mistake in Sam Patch! 

The water pouring still 
from the edge of the rocks, filling 
his ears with its sound, hard to interpret* 
A wonder! 

After this start he toured the West, his only companions a fox 
and a bear which he picked up in his travels. 

He jumped from a rocky ledge at Goat Island into the Niagara 
River. Then he announced that before returning to the Jerseys he 
was going to show the West one final marvel. He would leap 1  
feet from the falls of the Genesee River on November , 9. 
Excursions came from great distances in the United States and 
even from Canada to see the wonder. 

A platform was built at the edge of the falls. He went to great 
trouble to ascertain the depth of the water below. He even suc- 
cessfully performed one practice leap. 

On the day the crowds were gathered on all sides. He appeared 
and made a short speech as he was wont to do. A speech! What 
could he say that he must leap so desperately to complete it? And 
plunged toward the stream below. But instead of descending with a 
plummet-like fall his body wavered in the air — Speech had failed 
him. He was confused. The word had been drained of its meaning. 
There's no mistake in Sam Patch. He struck the water on his side 
and disappeared. 

A great silence followed as the crowd stood spellbound. 

Not until the following spring was the body found frozen in an 
ice-cake. 

He threw his pet bear once from the cliff overlooking the Niagara 
rapids and rescued it after, down stream. 




There is no direction. Whither? I 
cannot say. I cannot say 
more than how. The how (the howl) only 
is at my disposal (proposal) : watching — 
colder than stone . 

a bud forever green, 
tight-curled, upon the pavement, perfect 
in juice and substance but divorced, divorced 
from its fellows, fallen low— 

i 

Divorce is 
the sign of knowledge in our time, 
divorce! divorce! 

with the roar of the river 
forever in our ears (arrears) 
inducing sleep and silence, the roar 
of eternal sleep . challenging 
our waking — 

—unfledged desire, irresponsible, green, 
colder to the hand than stone, 
unready — challenging our waking: 

Two halfgrown girls hailing hallowed Easter, 
(an inversion of all out-of-doors) weaving 
about themselves, from under 
the heavy air, whorls of thick translucencies 
poured down, cleaving them away, 
shut from the light: bare- 
headed, their clear hair dangling— 



Two- 
disparate among the pouring 
waters of their hair in which nothing is 
molten — 

two, bound by an instinct to be the same: 

ribbons, cut from a piece, 

cerise pink, binding their hair: one- 

a willow twig pulled from a low 

leafless bush in full bud in her hand, 

(or eels or a moon! ) 

holds it, the gathered spray, 

upright in the air, the pouring air, 

strokes the soft fur — 

Ain't they beautiful! 

Certainly I am not a robin nor erudite, 

no Erasmus nor bird that returns to the same 

ground year by year. Or if I am 

the ground has undergone 

a subtle transformation, its identity altered. 

Indians! 

Why even speak of "I," he dreams, which 
interests me almost not at all? 

The theme 

is as it may prove: asleep, unrecognized- 
all of a piece, alone 

in a wind that does not move the others— 

in that way: a way to spend 

a Sunday afternoon while the green bush shakes.

the shallows among the blue-flowered 
pickerel-weed, in summer, summer! if it should 
ever come, in the shallow water!

Stale as a whale's breath: breath! 

Breath!

both silent, uncommunicative

I draw my breath or how to employ it 
clearly — if not well: 

Clearly!

with giraffish awkwardness, slightly 

on a long axis, so slightly 

as hardly to be noticed, in itself the tempest 

Thus 

the first wife, with giraffish awkwardness 
among thick lightnings that stab at 
die mystery of a man: in sum, a sleep, a 
source, a scourge 

on a log, her varnished hair 
trussed up like a termite's nest (forming 
the lines) and, her old thighs 
gripping the log reverently, that, 
all of a piece, holds up the others — 
alert: begin to know the mottled branch 
that sings . 



certainly NOT the university, 
a green bud fallen upon the pavement its 
sweet breath suppressed: Divorce (the 
language stutters)

two sisters from whose open mouths 
Easter is born — crying aloud, 

Divorce! 

While 

the green bush sways: is whence 

I draw my breath, swaying, all of a piece, 

separate, livens briefly, for the moment 

unafraid 



Which is to- say, though it be poorly 
said, there is a first wife 

the stress to hold it there, innate 



a flower 



a flower- whose history 




among the ferny rocks, laughs at the names 

trap it. Escapes! 
but by lying still— 

A history that has, by its den in the 
rocks, bole and fangs, its own cane-brake 
whence, half hid, canes and stripes 
blending, it grins (beauty defied) 
not for the sake of the encyclopedia. 



Were we near enough its stinking breath 

would fell us. The temple upon 

the rock is its brother, whose majesty 

lies in jungles— rmade to spring, 

at the rifle-shot of learning: to kill 

and grind those bones: 

These terrible things they reflect: 

the snow falling into the water, 

part upon the rock, part in the dry weeds 

and part into the water where it 

vanishes— its form no longer what it was: 

the bird alighting, that pushes 

its feet forward to take up the impetus 

and falls forward nevertheless 

among the twigs. The weak-necked daisy 

bending to the wind 

The sun 

winding the yellow bindweed about a 
bush; worms and gnats, life under a stone. 
The pitiful snake with its mosaic skin 
and frantic tongue. The horse, the bull 
the whole din of fracturing thought 
as it falls tinnily to nothing upon the streets 
and the absurd dignity of a locomotive 
hauling freight — 

Pithy philosophies of 
dailv exits and entrances, with books 
propping up one end of the shaky table — 
The vague accuracies of events dancing two 
and two with language which they 
forever surpass — and dawns 
tangled in darkness— 



The giant in whose apertures we 
cohabit, unaware of what air supports 
us — the vague, the particular 
no less vague 

his thoughts, the stream 
and we, we two, isolated in the stream, 
we also: three alike — 

we sit and talk 
I wish to be with you abed, we two 
as if the bed were the bed of a stream 
— I have much to say to you 

We sit and talk, 
quietly, with long lapses of silence 
and I am aware of the stream 
that has no language, coursing 
beneath the quiet heaven of 
your eyes 

which has no speech; to 
go to bed with you, to pass beyond 
the moment of meeting, while the 
currents float still in mid-air, to 
fall— 

with you from the brink, before 
the crash — 

to seize the moment. 

We sit and talk, sensing a little 
the rushing impact of the giants' 
violent torrent rolling over us, a 
few moments. 

If I should demand it, as 
it has been demanded of others 



and given too swiftly, and you should 
consent. If you would consent 

We sit and talk and the 
silence speaks of the giants 
who have died in the past and have 
returned to those scenes unsatisfied 
and who is not unsatisfied, the 
silent, Singac the rock-shoulder 
emerging from the rocks — and the giants 
live again in your silence and 
unacknowledged desire — 

And the air lying over the water 

lifts the ripples, brother 

to brother, touching as die mind touches* 

counter-current, upstream 

brings in the fields, hot and cold 

parallel but never mingling, one that whirls 

backward at the brink and curls invisibly 

upward, fills the hollow, whirling, 

an accompaniment— -but apart, observant of 

the distress, sweeps down or up clearing 

the spray — 

brings in the rumors of separate 
worlds, the birds as against the fish, the grape 
to the green weed that streams out undulant 
with the current at low tide beside the 
bramble in blossom, die storm by the flood — 
song and wings — 

one unlike the other, twin 
of the other, conversant with eccentricities 
side by side, bearing the water-drops 
and snow, vergent, the water soothing the air when 
it drives in among the rocks fitfully — 



While at 1 0, feet, coming in over 
the sombre mountains of Haiti, the land-locked 
bay back of Port au Prince, blue vitreol 
streaked with paler streams, shabby as loose 
hair, badly dyed— like chemical waste 
mixed in, eating out the shores . 

He pointed it down and struck the rough 
waters of the bay, hard; but lifted it again and 
coming^down gradually, hit again hard but 
remained down to taxi to the pier where 
they were waiting — 

(Thence Carlos had fled in the *s 
leaving the portraits of my grandparents, 
the furniture, the silver, even the meal 
hot upon the table before the Revolutionists 
coming in at the far end of the street.) 

I was over to see my mother today. My sister, "Billy," was at the 
schoolhouse. I never go when she is there. My mother had a sour 
stomach, yesterday. I found her in bed. However, she had helped 
"Billy" do up the work. My mother has always tried to do her part, 
and she is always trying to do something for her children. A few 
days before I left I found her starting to mend my trousers. I took 
them away from her and said, "Mother, you can't do that for me, 
with your crippled head. You know. I always get Louisa or Mrs. 
Tony to do that work for me." "Billy" looked up and said, "It's too 
bad about y6u." 

I have already told you I helped with the work, did dishes, three 
times daily, swept and mopped floors, porches and cleaned yards, 
mowed the lawn, tarred the roofs, did repair work and helped 
wash, brought in the groceries and carried out the pots and washed 
them each morning, even "Billy's" with dung in it, sometimes, and 
did other jobs and then it was not uncommon for "Billy" to say: 
"You don't do anything here." Once she even said, "I saw you out 
there the other morning sweeping porches, pretending you were 
doing something." 

Of course, "Billy" has been chopped on by the surgical chopper 
and has gone through the menopause and she had a stroke of facial 




paralysis, but she has always been eccentric and wanted to boss. 
My Hartford sister said she used to run over her until she became 
big enough to throsh her. 1 have seen her slap her Husband square 
in the face. I would have knocked her so far she would not have 
got back in a week. She has run at me with a poker, etc., but I always 
told her not to strike* "Don't make that mistake*" I would always 
caution. 

"Billy" is a good worker and thorough going but she wants to lay 
blame — always on the other fellow. I told my buddie, in Hartford, 
she was just like our landlady, the pistol. He said he had a sister 
just like that. 

As to my mother, she is obsessed with fire. That's why she doesn't 
want me to stay there, alone, when she is dead. The children have 
all said for years, she thinks more of me man any child she has. 

T. 

They fail, they limp with corns. I 
think he means to kill me, I don't know 
what to do. He comes in after midnight, 
I pretend to be asleep. He stands there, 
I feel him looking down at me, I 
am afraid! 

Who? Who? Who? What? 
A summer evening? 

A quart of potatoes, half a dozen oranges, 
a bunch of beets and some soup greens. 
Look, I have a new set of teeth. Why you 
look ten years younger . 

But never, in despair and anxiety, 
forget to drive wit in, in till it discover 
his thoughts, decorous and simple, 
and never forget that though his thoughts 
are decorous and simple, the despair 
and anxiety: the grace and detail of 
a dynamo — 

So in his high decorum he is wise. 




A delirium of solutions, forthwith, forces 
him into back streets, to begin again: 
up hollow stairs among acrid smells 
to obscene rendezvous. And there he finds 
a festering sweetness of red lollipops — 
and a yelping dog: 

Come YEAH, Chichi! Or a great belly 
that no longer laughs but mourns 
with its expressionless black navel love's 
deceit 

They are the divisions and imbalances 
of his whole concept, made weak by pity, 
flouting desire; they are — No ideas but 
in the facts 

I positively feel no rancour against you, but will urge you toward 
those vapory ends, and implore you to submit to your own myths, 
and that any postponement in doing so is a lie for you. Delay makes 
us villainous and cheap: All that I can say of myself and of others 
is that it matters not so much how a man lies or f ornicates or even 
loves money, provided that he has not a Pontius Pilate but an 
hungered Lazarus in his intestines. Once Plotinus asked, "What is 
philosophy?" and he replied, "What is most important." The late 
Miguel de Unamuno also cried out, not "More light, more light! " 
as Goethe did when he was dying, but "More warmth, more 
warmth!" I hate more than anything else the mocking stone bowels 
of Pilate; I abhor that more than cozening and falsehoods and the 
little asps of malice that are on all carnal tongues. That is why I am 
attacking you, as you put it, not because I think you cheat or lie 
for pelf, but because you lie and chafe and gull whenever you see 
a jot of the tonr Galilean in a man's intestines. You hate it; it makes 
you writhe; that's why all the Americans so dote upon that canaille 
word, extrovert. Of course, nature in you knows better as some 
very lovely passages that you have written show. 

But to conclude, you and I can do without each other, in the 
usual way of the sloughy habits and manners of people. I can con- 
tinue with my monologue of life and death until inevitable anni- 
hilation. But it's wrong. And as I have said, whatever snares I make 
for myself, I won't weep over Poe, or Rilke, or Dickinson, or Gogol, 
while I turn away the few waifs and Ishmaels of the spirit in this 




country. I have said that the artist is an Ishmael; Call me Ishmael, 
fays Melville in the very first line of Moby Dick; he is the wild ass of 
a man; — Ishmael means affliction. You see, I am always concerned 
with the present when I read the plaintive epitaphs in the American 
graveyard of literature and poetry, and in weighing the head and 
the heart that ached in the land, that you are not. With you the 
book is one thing, and the man who wrote it another. The concep- 
tion of time in literature and in chronicles makes it easy for men 
to make such hoax cleavages. But I am getting garrulous: —

How strange you are, you idiot! 

So you think because the rose 

is red that you shall have the mastery? 

The rose is green and will bloom, 

overtopping you, green, livid 

green when you shall no more speak, or 

taste, or even be. My whole life 

has hung too long upon a partial victory. 

But, creature of the weather, I 
don't want to go any faster than 
I have to go to win. 

Music it for yourself. 

He picked a hairpin from the floor 
and stuck it in his ear, probing 
around inside— 

The melting snow 

dripped from the cornice by his window 
 strokes a minute — 

He descried 

in the linoleum at his feet a woman's 
face, smelled his hands, 

strong of a lotion he had used 
not long since, lavender, 
rolled his thumb 

about the tip of his left index finger 
and watched it dip each time, 
like the head 




of a cat licking its paw, heard the 

faint filing sound it made: of 

earth his ears are full, there is no sound 

: And his thoughts soared 

to the magnificence of imagined delights 

where he would probe 

as into the pupil of an eye 

as through a hoople of fire, and emerge 

sheathed in a robe 

streaming with light. What heroic 

dawn of desire 

is denied to his thoughts? 

They are trees 

from whose leaves streaming with rain 
his mind drinks of desire : 

Who is younger than I? 

The contemptible twig? 
that I was? stale in mind 

whom the dirt 

recently gave up? Weak 

to the wind. 
Gracile? Taking up no place, 
too narrow to be engraved 

with the maps 

of a world it never knew, 

the green and 
dovegrey countries of 
- the mind. 



A mere stick that has 

twenty leaves 
against my convolutions. 

What shall it become, 

Snot nose, that I have 

not been? 
I enclose it and 

persist, go on. 

Let it rot, at my center. 

Whose center? 
I stand and surpass 

youth's leanness. 

My surface is myself. 

Under which 
to witness, youth is 

buried. Roots? 



Everybody has roots.

Others are also at fault because 
they do nothing. 




By nightfall of the th, acres of mud were exposed and the water 
mostly had been drawn off. The fish did not run into the nets. But 
I black crowd of people could be seen from the cars, standing 
about under the willows, watching the men and boys on the drained 
lake bottom . , . some hundred yards in front of the dam. 

The whole bottom was covered with people, and the big eels, 
weighing from three to four pounds each, would approach the edge 
and then the boys would strike at them. From this time everybody 
got all they wanted in a few moments, 

On the morning of the th, the boys and men were still there. 
There seemed to be no end to the stock of eels especially. All 
through the year fine messes of fish have been taken from the lake; 
but nobody dreamt of the quantity that were living in it. Singularly 
to say not a snake had been seen. The fish and eels seemed to have 
monopolized the lake entirely. Boys in bathing had often reported 
the bottom as full of big snakes that had touched their feet and 
limbs but they were without doubt the eels. 

Those who prepared the nets were not the ones who got the most 
fish. It was the hoodlums and men who leaped into the mud and 
water where the nets could not work that rescued from the mud 
and water the finest load of fish. 

A man going tothe % depot with a peach basket gave the basket 
to a boy and he filled it in five minutes, deftly snapping the vertebrae 
back of the heads to make them stay in, and he charged the modest 
sum of . cents for the basket full of eels. The crowd increased. 
There were millions of fish. Wagons were sent for to carry away 
the heaps that lined both sides of the roadway. Little boys were 
dragging behind them all they could carry home, strung on sticks 
and in bags and baskets. There were heaps of catfish all along the 
walk, bunches of suckers and pike, and there were three black bass 
on one stick, a silk weaver had caught them. At a quarter past seven 
a wagon body was filled with fish and eels . . . four wagon loads 
had been carried away. 

At least fifty men in the lake were hard at work and had sticks 
with which they struck the big eels and benumbed them as they 
glided along the top of the mud in shoal water, and so were able to 
t hold them until they could carry them out: the men and boys 
Splashed about in the mud. . . . Night did not put an end to the 
scene. All night long with lights on shore and lanterns over the 
mud, the work went on. 



Moveless 

he envies the men that ran 
and could run off 
toward the peripheries— 
to other centers, direct — * 
for clarity (if 
they found it) 

loveliness and 
authority in the world— 

a sort of springtime 

toward which their minds aspired 

but which he saw, 

within himself — ice bound 

and leaped, "the body, not until 
the following spring, frozen in 
an ice cake" 

Shortly before two o'clock August i<S, 5, Mr. Leonard Sand- 
ford, of the firm of Post and Sandford, while at work on the im- 
provements for the water company, at the Falls, was looking into 
the chasm near the wheel house of the water works. He saw what 
looked like a mass of clothing, and on peering intendy at times as the 
torrent sank and rose, he could distincdy see the legs of a man, the 
body being lodged between two logs, in a very extraordinary man- 
ner. It was in the "crotch" of these logs that the body was caught. 

The sight of a human body hanging over the precipice was indeed 
one which was as.novel as it was awful in appearance. The news of 
its finding attracted a very large number of visitors all that day. 

What more, to carry the thing through? 

Half the river red, half steaming purple 
from the factory vents, spewed out hot, 
swirling, bubbling. The dead bank, 
shining mud . 




What can he think else — along 

die gravel of the ravished park, torn by 

the wild workers' children tearing up the grass, 

kicking, screaming? A chemistry, corollary 

to academic misuse, which the theorem 

with accuracy, accurately misses . 

He thinks: their mouths eating and kissing, 
spitting and sucking, speaking; a 
partitype of five 

He thinks: two eyes; nothing escapes them, 
neither the convolutions of the sexual orchid 
hedged by fern and honey-smells, to 
the last hair of the consent of the dying. 

And silk spins from the hot drums to a music 

of pathetic son venirs, a comb and nail-file 

in an imitation leather case — to 

remind him, to remind him! and 

a photograph-holder with pictures of himself 

between the two children, all returned 

weeping, weeping — in the back room 

of the widow who married again, a vile tongue 

but laborious ways, driving a drunken 

husband 

What do I care for the flies, shit with them* 
Pm out of the house all day. 

Into the sewer they threw the dead horse. 
What birth does this foretell? I think 
he'll write a novel bye and bye . 

P. Your interest is in the bloody loam but what 
I'm after is the finished product. 



I. Leadership passes into empire; empire begets in- 
solence; insolence brings ruin. 

Such is the mystery of his one two, one two. 

And so among the rest he drives 

in his new car out to the suburbs, out 

by the rhubarb farm— a simple thought— 

where the convent of the Little Sisters of 

St. Ann pretends a mystery t 

What 

irritation of offensively red brick is this, 
red as poor-man's flesh? Anachronistic? 

The mystery 

of streets and back rooms — 

wiping the nose on sleeves, come here 

to dream . 

Tenement windows, sharp edged, in which 
no face is seen — though curtainless, into 
which no more than birds and insects look or 
the moon stares, concerning which they dare 
look back, by times. 

It is the complement exact of vulgar streets, 
a mathematic calm, controlled, the architecture 
mete, sinks there, lifts here . 
the same'blank and staring eyes. 

An incredible 

clumsiness of address, 

senseless rapes — caught on hands and knees 
scrubbing a greasy corridor; the blood 
boiling as though in a vat, where they soak — 

Plaster saints, glass jewels 

and those apt paper flowers, bafHingly

their forthright beauty, beside: 



Things, things unmentionable, 

the sink with the waste farina in it and 

lumps of rancid meat, milk-bottle-tops: have

Have here (in his thoughts) 

a complement tranquil and chaste. 

He shifts his change: 

*The 7th, December, this year, (7) at night, was a large shock 
of an earthquake, accompanied with a remarkable rumbling noise; 
people waked in their beds, the doors flew open, bricks fell from 
the chimneys; the consternation was serious, but happily no great 
damage ensued." 



hidden from sun and sight — 

hedged in by the pouring torrent- 
and has its birth and death there 
in that moist chamber, shut from 
the world — and unknown to the world, 
cloaks itself in mystery — 



Thought clambers up, 
snail like, upon the wet rocks 



And the myth 




a flickering green 
inspiring terror, watching 



And standing, shrouded there, in that din, 
Earth, the chatterer, father of all 
speech 




N.B. "In order apparently to bring the meter still more within the 
sphere of prose and common speech, Hipponax ended his iambics 
with a spondee or a trochee instead of an iambus, doing thus the 
utmost violence to the rhythmical structure. These deformed and 
mutilated verses were called xw\L*fipot or tanpoi <r#c<£foyT« (lame 
or limping iambics). They communicated a curious crustiness to the 
style. The choliambi are in poetry what the dwarf or cripple is in 
human nature. Here again, by their acceptance of this halting meter, 
the Greeks displayed their acute aesthetic sense of propriety, rec- 
ognizing the harmony which subsists between crabbed verses and 
the distorted subjects with which they dealt — the vices and per- 
versions of humanity — as well as their agreement with the snarl- 
ing spirit of the satirist. Deformed verse was suited to deformed 
morality."

now because I find, widi the passing of time, that the outcome of 
my failure with you has been the complete damming up of all my 
creative capacities in a particularly disastrous manner such as I 
have never before experienced. 

For a great many weeks now (whenever I've tried to write po- 
etry) every thought f ve had, even every feeling, has been struck 
off some surface crust of myself which began gathering when I 
first sensed that you were ignoring the real contents of my last 
letters to you, and which finally congealed into some impenetrable 
substance when you asked me to quit corresponding with you 
altogether without even an explanation. 

That kind of blockage, exiling one's self from one's self — have 
you ever experienced h? I dare say you have, at moments; and if 
so, you can well understand what a serious psychological injury 
it amounts to when turned into a permanent day-to-day condition. 

How do I love you? These!

He smiled patiently , The typical American question.

sound of it here but with the wind!) This is my entire 
occupation. 




No fairer day ever dawned anywhere than May 2, 0, when 
the German Singing Societies of Paterson met on Garret Mountain, 
as they did many years before on the first Sunday in May. 

However the meeting of 0 proved a fatal day, when William 
Dalzell, who owned a piece of property near the scene of the fes- 
tivities, shot John Joseph Van Houten. Dalzell claimed that the 
visitors had in previous years walked over his garden and was 
determined that this year he would stop them from crossing any 
part of his grounds. 

Immediately after the shot the quiet group of singers was turned 
into an infuriated mob who would take Dalzell into their own 
hands. The mob then proceeded to burn the barn into which Dalzell 
had retreated from the angry group. 

Dalzell fired at the approaching mob from a window in the barn 
and one of the bullets struck a little girl in the cheek. . . . Some of 
the Paterson Police rushed Dalzell out of the barn [to] the house of 
John Ferguson some half furlong away. 

The crowd now numbered some ten thousand, 

"a great beast!" 

for many had come from the city to join the 
conflict. The case looked serious, for the Police were greatly out- 
numbered. The crowd then tried to burn the Ferguson house and 
Dalzell went to the house of John McGuckin. While m this house 
it was that Sergeant John McBride suggested that it might be well 
to send for William McNulty, Dean of Saint Joseph's Catholic 
Church. 

In a moment the Dean set on a plan. He proceeded to the scene 
in a hack. Taking Dalzell by the arm, in full view of the infuriated 
mob, he led the man to the hack and seating himself by his side, 
ordered the driver to proceed. The crowd hesitated, bewildered 
between the bravery of the Dean and

When! from before his feet, half tripping, 
picking a way, there starts 

a flight of empurpled wings! 
— invisibly created (their 
jackets dust-grey) from the dust kindled 
to sudden ardor! 

They fly away, churring! until 
their strength spent they plunge 
to the coarse cover again and disappear 
— but leave, livening the mind, a flashing 
of wings and a churring song 

AND a grasshopper of red basalt, boot-long, 
tumbles from the core of his mind, 
a rubble-bank disintegrating beneath a 
tropic downpour

a counter-weight or counter buoyancy

Before his feet, at each step, the flight 
is renewed. A burst of wings, a quick 
churring sound : 

couriers to the ceremonial of love!

No flesh but the caress! 

He is led forward by their announcing wings. 

If that situation with you (your ignoring those particular letters 
and then your final note) had belonged to the inevitable lacrimae 
rerum (as did, for instance, my experience with Z.) its result could 
not have been (as it has been) to destroy the validity for me myself 
of myself, because in that case nothing to do with my sense of 
personal identity would have been maimed — the cause of one's 
frustrations in such instances being not in one's self nor in the other 
person but merely in the sorry scheme of things. But since your 
ignoring those letters was not "natural" in that sense (or rather since 
to regard it as unnatural I am forced, psychologically, to feel that 
what I wrote you about, was sufficiently trivial and unimportant and 
absurd to merit your evasion) it could not but follow that that 
whole side of life connected with those letters should in consequence 
take on for my own self that same kind of unreality and inacces- 
sibility which the inner lives of other people often have for us. .

Shortly jtfter midnight, August , 8, special officer Goodridge, 
when, in front of the Franklin House, heard a strange squealing 
noise down towards Ellison Street. Running to see what was the 
matter, he found a cat at bay under the water table at Clark's hard- 
ware store on the corner, confronting a strange black animal too 
snail to be a cat and entirely too large for a rat. The officer ran up 
J to the spot and the animal got in under the grating of the cellar 
Window, from which it frequently poked its head with a lightning 
rapidity. Mr. Goodridge made several strikes at it with his club but 
was unable to hit it. Then officer Keyes came along and as soon as 
he saw it, he said it was a mink, which confirmed the theory that 
Mr. Goodridge had already formed. Both tried for a while to hit 
it with their clubs but were unable to do so, when finally officer 




Goodridge drew his pistol and fired a shot at the animal. The shot 
evidently missed its mark, but the noise and powder so frightened 

the little joker that it jumped out into the street, and made down 
into Ellison Street at a wonderful gait, closely followed by the two 
officers. The mink finally disappeared down a cellar window under 
the grocery store below Spangermacher's lager beer saloon, and 
that was the last seen of it. The cellar was examined again in the 
morning, but nothing further could be discovered of the little critter 
that had caused so much fun. 

Without invention nothing is well spaced, 

unless the mind change, unless 

the stars are new measured, according 

to their relative positions, the 

line will not change, the necessity 

will not matriculate: unless there is 

a new mind there cannot be a new 

line, the old will go on 

repeating itself with recurring 

deadliness: without invention 

nothing lies under the witch-hazel 

bush, the alder does not grow from among 

the hummocks margining the all 

but spent channel of the old swale, 

the small foot-prints 

of the mice under the overhanging 

tufts of the bunch-grass will not

will never again take on its ancient 

divisions when the word, a supple word,

Under the bush they lie protected

3 colored girls, of age! stroll by 
—their color flagrant, 

their voices vagrant 
their laughter wild, flagellant, dissociated 
from the fixed scene 

But the white girl, her head 

upon an arm, a butt between her fingers 

lies under the bush 

Semi-naked, facing her, a sunshade 
over his eyes, 
he talks with her

behind them in the trees — 

I bought a new bathing suit, just 

pants and a brassier : 
the breasts and

mottled by the shadows of the leaves

at least here unchallenged. 
Not undignified. 

talking, flagrant beyond all talk 
in perfect domesticity — 
And having bathed 

and having eaten (a few

their pitiful thoughts do meet

^falking 

he rejoins the path and sees, on a treeless 
knoll — the red path choking it — 
a stone wall, a sort of circular 
redoubt against the sky, barren and 
unoccupied. Mount. Why not? 

A chipmunk, 
with tail erect, scampers among the stones. 

(Thus the rnind grows, up flinty pinnacles) 

but as he leans, in his stride, 
at sight of a flint arrow-head' 

(it is not) 

— there 

in the distance, to the north, appear 
to him the chronic hills 

Well, so they are. 

He stops short: 

Who's here? 

To a stone bench, to which she's leashed, 
within the wall a man in tweeds— a pipe hooked in his jaw — is 
combing out a new-washed Collie bitch. The deliberate comb- 
Strokes part the long hair — even her face he combs though her 
legs tremble slightly— until it lies, as he designs, like ripples 
in white sand giving off its clean-dog odor. The floor, stone 
slabs, she stands patiently before his caresses in that bare *'sea 
'chamber"

in the middle distance stands up prominently 
from its pubic grove 



Dear B. Please excuse me for not having told you this when I was 
over to your house. I had no courage to answer your questions so 
 write it. Your dog is going to have puppies although I prayed 
she would be okey. It wasn't that she was left alone as she never 
was but I used to let her out at dinner time while I hung up my 
clothes. At the time, it was on a Thursday, my mother-in-law had 
some sheets and table cloths out on the end of the line. I figured the 
dogs wouldn't come as long as I was there and none came thru my 
yard or near the apartment. He must have come between your 
hedge and the house. Every few seconds I would run to the end 
of the line or peek under the sheets to see if Musty was alright. She 
was until I looked a minute too late. I took sticks and stones after 
the dog but he wouldn't beat it. George gave me plenty of hell and 
I started praying that I had frightened the other dog so much that 
nothing had happened* I know you'll be cursing like a son-of-a-gun 
and probably won't ever speak to me again for not having told 
you. Don*t think I haven't been worrying about Musty. She's occu- 
pied my mind every day since that awful event. You won't think 
so highly of me now and feel like protecting me. Instead Fll bet 
you could kill ... 

And still the picnickers come on, now 
early afternoon, and scatter through the 
trees over the fenced-in acres 

Voices! 

multiple and inarticulate . voices 
clattering loudly to the sun, to 
die clouds. Voices! 

assaulting the air gaily from all sides. 

— among which the ear strains to catch 
the movement of one voice among the rest 
— a reed-like voice 

of peculiar accent 

Thus she finds what peace there is, reclines, 

before his approach, stroked 

by their clambering feet — for pleasure 




It is all for

Sunday in the park, 
limited by the escarpment, eastward; to 
the west abutting on the old road: recreation 
with a view! the binoculars chained 
to anchored stanchions along the east wall- 
beyond which, a hawk 
* - soars! 

— a trumpet sounds fitfully. 

Stand at the rampart (use a metronome 

if your ear is deficient, one made in Hungary 

if you prefer) 

and look away north by east where the church 

spires still spend their wits against 

the sky to the ball-park 

in the hollow with its minute figures running 

— beyond the gap where the river 

plunges into the narrow gorge, unseen 

— and the imagination soars, as a voice 
beckons, a thundrous voice, endless

that has ineludably called them — 

that unmoving roar!

together, summoned them from the pit . 

— his voice, one among many (unheard) 
moving under all. 

The mountain quivers. 
Time! Count! Sever and mark time! 

So during the early afternoon, from place 

to place he moves, 

his voice mingling with other voices 

— the voice in his voice 

opening his old throat, blowing out his lips, 

kindling his mind (more 

than his mind will kindle) 

— following the hikers. 

At last he comes to the idlers' favorite 
haunts, the picturesque summit, where 
the blue-stone (rust-red where exposed) 
has been faulted at various levels 

(ferns rife among the stones) 
into rough terraces and partly closed in 
dens of sweet grass, the ground gently sloping. 

Loiterers in groups straggle 

over the bare rock-table — scratched by their 

boot-nails more than the glacier scratched 

them — walking indifferent through 

each other's privacy 

— in any case, 
the center of movement, the core of gaiety. 



Here a young man, perhaps sixteen,

It is this air! 

the air of the Midi

of her thoughts, cocks her old head 
and dances! raising her skirts: 

La la la la! 

What a bunch of bums! Afraid somebody see 
you? 

Blah! 

Excrementi! 

— she spits. 

Look a' me, Grandma! Everybody too damn 
lazy. 

This is the old, the very old, old upon old, 
the undying: even to the minute gestures, 
the hand holding the cup, the wine 
spilling, the arm stained by it: 



Remember 



the peon in the lost 
Eisenstein film drinking 

from a wine-skin with the abandon 
of a horse drinking 

so that it slopped down his chin? 
down his neck, dribbling 

over his shirt-front and down 
onto his pants — laughing, toothless? 

Heavenly man! 

— the leg raised, verisimilitude 
even to the coarse contours of the leg, the 
bovine touch! The leer, the cave of it, 
the female of it facing the male, the satyr —

with that lonely implication, goatherd 
and goat, fertility, the attack, drunk, 
cleansed

his sleep, sweating in his sleep — laboring

to catch the movement of one voice

A cop is directing traffic 
across the main road up 
a little wooded slope toward 
the conveniences: 



humped roots matted into the shallow soil

sweetbarked sassafras 

leaning from the rancid grease: 

deformity—

An orchestral dullness overlays their world

"the bomb" over to a few industrialists. I don't think they will 
succeed but . . that is what I mean when I refuse to get ex- 
cited over the cry, Communist! they use to blind us. It's terri- 
fying to think how easily we can be destroyed, a few votes. 
Even though Communism is a threat, are Communists any 
worse than the guilty bastards trying in that way to under-

at hand, music blurts out suddenly. 

Walking — 

a 

cramped arena has been left clear at the base 
of the observation tower near the urinals. This 
is the. Lord's line: Several broken benches 
drawn up in a curving row against the shrubbery 
face the flat ground, benches on which 
a few children have been propped by the others 
against their running off . 

Three middle aged men with iron smiles 
stand behind the benches — backing (watching) 
the kids, the kids and several women — and 
holding, 




Before them an old man, 
wearing a fringe of long white hair, bareheaded, 
his glabrous skull reflecting the sun's 
light and in shirtsleeves, is beginning to 
speak — 



calling to the birds and trees! 



Jumping up and down in his ecstasy he beams 
into the empty blue, eastward, oyer the parapet 
toward the city 

There are people — especially among women — who can speak only 
to one person. And I am one of those women. I do not come 
easily to confidences (though it cannot but seem otherwise to you) . 
I could not possibly convey to any one of those people who have 
crossed my path in these few months, those particular phases of my 
life which I made the subject of my letters to you. I must let myself 
be entirely misunderstood and misjudged in all my economic and 
social maladjustments, rather than ever attempt to communicate to 
anyone else what I wrote to you about. And so my having heaped 
these confidences upon you (however tiresome you may have found 
them and however far I may yet need to go in the attainment of 
complete self-honesty which is difficult for anyone) was enough 
in itself to have caused my failure with you to have so disastrous 
an effect upon me. 

Look, there lies the city!

I tell you — lifting up his arms — I bring

It was windless and hot in the sun 
where he was standing bareheaded. 

Great riches shall be yours! 
I wasn't born here. I was born in what we call 
over here the Old Country. But it's the same 
the same kind of people there as here

over there — and that makes the dil 




My family were poor people. So I started to work 
when I was pretty young. 

—Oh, it took me a Ions time! but 
one day I said to myself, Klaus, that's my name, 
Klaus, I said to myself, you're a success. 

You have worked hard but you have been 
lucky. 

You're 

rich — and now we're going to enjoy ourselves. 

Hamilton saw more clearly than anyone else with what urgency 
the new government must assume authority over the States if it 
was to survive. He never trusted the people, "a great beast," as he 
saw them and held Jefferson to be little better if not worse than any. 

" So I came to America! 

Especially in the matter of finances a critical stage presented 
itself. The States were inclined to shrug off the debt incurred during 
the recent war-^eaeh £tate preferring to undertake its own private 
obligations separately. Hamilton saw that if this were allowed to 
ensue the effect would be fatal, to future credit. He came out with 
vigor and cunning for "Assumption," assumption by the Federal 
Government of the national debt, and the granting to it of powers 
of taxation without which it could not raise the funds necessary for 
this purpose. A storm followed in which he found himself opposed 
by Madison and Jefferson. 

But when I got here I soon found out that I 

was a pretty small frog in a mighty big pool. So 

I went to work all over again. I suppose 

I was born with a gift for that sort of thing. 

I throve and I gloried in it. And T thought then 

that I was happy. And I was — as happy 

as money could make me. 

But did it make me GOOD? 




He stopped to laugh, healthily, and 
his wan assistants followed him, 
forcing it out—grinning against 
the rocks with wry smiles 

NO! he shouted, bending 
at the knees and straightening himself up 
violently with the force of his emphasis — like 
Beethoven getting a crescendo out of an 
orchestra— NO! 

It did not make me good. (His clenched fists 
were raised above his brows.) I kept on making 
money, more and more of it, but it didn't make 
me good. 

America the golden! 
with trick and money

and molden 
we love thee bitter

Like Altgeld on the 

corner 
seeing the mourners

'we bow our heads 

before thee 
and take our hats

And so 

one day I heard a voice . . . a voice— just 
as 1 am talking to you here today. . . 



. , And the voice said, 
Klaus, what's the matter with you? You're not 
happy. I am happy! I shouted back, 
Fve got everything I want. No, it said. 
Klaus, that's a lie. You're not happy. 
And I had to admit it was the truth. I wasn't 
happy. That bothered me a lot. But I was pig- 
headed and when I thought it over I said 

you must be g< 
that worry you. 




our blessed Lord came to

I am worried, I replied, but I don't know what to 
do about it. I got everything that money can 
buy but I'm not happy, that's the truth. 

And the Lord said to me, Klaus, get rid of your 
money. You'll never be happy until you do that. 



As a corollary to the famous struggle for assumption lay the 
realization among many leading minds in the young republic that 
unless industry were set upon its feet, unless manufactured goods 
could be produced income for taxation would be a myth. 

The new world had been looked on as a producer of precious 
metals, pelts and raw materials to be turned over to the mother 
country for manufactured articles which the colonists had no choice 
but to buy at advanced prices. They were prevented from making 
woolen, cotton or linen cloth for sale. Nor were they allowed to 
build furnaces to convert the native iron into steel. 

Even during the Revolution Hamilton had been impressed by the 
site of the Great Falls of the Passaic. His fertile imagination en- 
visioned a great manufacturing center, a great Federal City, to 
supply the needs of the country. Here was water-power to turn the 
mill wheels and the navigable river to carry manufactured goods to 
the market centers: a national manufactory. 


Give up my money! 

—with monotonous insistence 
the falls of his harangue hung featureless 
upon the ear, yet with a certain strangeness 
as if arrested in space 

That would be a hard thing 
for me to do. What would my rich friends say? 
They'd say, That old fool Klaus Ehrens must 
be getting pretty crazy, getting rid of his 
cash. What! give up the thing Fd struggled all 
my life to pile up— so I could say I was rich? 
No! that I couldn't do. But I was troubled 
in mind. 

He paused to wipe his brow while 
the singers struck up a lively hymn tune. 

I couldn't eat, I couldn't 
sleep for thinking of my trouble so that 
when the Lord came to me the third time I was 
ready and I kneeled down before Him 
and said, Lord, do what you will with me! 

Give away your money, He said, and I 

will make you the richest man in the world! 

And I bowed my head and said to Him, Yea, Lord. 

And His blessed truth descended upon me and filled 

me with joy, such joy and such riches as I 

had nevsr in my life known to that day -and I said 

to Him, Master! 

In the Name of the Father 
and the Son and the Holy Ghost. 

Amen. 



Amen! Amen? echoed the devout assistants. 

Is this the only beauty here? 
And is this beauty- 
torn to shreds by the 
lurking schismatists? 

Where is beauty among 
these trees? 

Is it the dogs the owners 
bring here to dry their coats? 

beautiful and reflect 

no beauty but gross 

to be, anywhere, 
so flagrant in desire . 
The beauty of holiness, 
if this it be, 



is the only beauty 
visible in this place 
other than the view 
and a fresh budding tree. 

me long I can tell you! I threw it 
hands. And I began to feel better 




—and leaned on the parapet, thinking 



From here, one could see him— that 
tied man, that cold blooded 
murderer . April! in the distance

vantages along the cliff . having 
gathered since before daybreak

for money but doesn't always get it. 

Leans on the parapet thinking, while 
the preacher, outnumbered, addresses 
the leaves in the patient trees :

it was gone 

— he made a wide motion with both 
hands as of scattering money to the winds— 



— but the riches that had been given me are 
beyond ail counting. You can throw them 
carelessly about you on all sides — and still 
you will have more. For God Almighty has 
boundless resources and never fails. There is no 
end to the treasures of our Blessed Lord who 
died on the Cross for us that we may be saved. 
Amen. 



The Federal Reserve System is a private enterprise . . . a private 
monopoly . . . (with power) . . . given to it by a spineless Con- 




and lend it to private business 
(the same money over and over again at a high rate of interest) , 
and also to the Government whenever it needs money in war and 
peace; for which we, the people, representing the Government (in 
this instance at any rate) must pay interest to the banks in the form 
of high taxes.

Witnessing the Falls Hamilton was impressed by this show of 
what in those times was overwhelming power . . . planned a stone 
aqueduct following a proposed boulevard, as the crow flies, to 
Newark with outlets every mile or two along the river for 
of factories: The Society for Useful Manufactures: SUM, 
called it. 

The newspapers of the day spoke in enthusiastic terms of the fine 
prospects of the "National Manufactory" where they fondly be- 
lieved would be produced all cotton^assimeres, wall papers, books, 
and straw hats, shoes, carriages, pottery, bricks, pots, pans and 





buttons needed in the United Starei,- But L'Enfant*s plans were 
more magnificent than practical and Peter Colt, Treasurer of the 
State of Connecticut* was chosen in his place. 

.... 'Hie prominent purpose of the 
Society was the manufacture of cotton goods. 

Washington at his first inaugural 

wore 

a coat of Crow-black homespun woven 
in Paterson 



In other words, the Federal Reserve Banks constitute a Legalized 
National Usury System, whose Customer No. i is our Government, 
the richest country in the world. Every one of us is paying tribute 
to the money racketeers on every dollar we earn through hard 
work. 

In all our great bond issues the interest is always 
greater than the principle. All of the great public works cost more 
than twice the actual cost, on that account. Under the present system 
of doing business we simply add  to  per cent to the stated 
cost. 

' The people must pay anyway; why should they be compelled to 
pay twice? The whole national debt is made up on interest 
charges. If the people ever get to thinking of bonds and bills at the 
same time, the game is up. 

If there is subtlety, 
you are subtle. I beg your indulgence: 
no prayer should cause you anything 
but tears. I had a friend ... 
let it pass. I remember when as a child 
I stopped praying and shook with fear 
until sleep — your sleep calmed me — 

You also, I am sure, have read 
Frazer's Golden Bough. It does you 
justice — a prayer such as might be made 
by a lover who 




appraises every feature of his bride's 
comeliness, and terror-^ 
terror to him such as one, a man 
married, feels toward his bride— 



You are the eternal bride and 
father — quid pro quo,

for you in the multiplicity 
of your debacle. The world spreads 
for me like-a flower opening— and 
will close for me as might a rose- 
wither and fall to the ground 
and rot and be drawn up 
into a flower again. But you 
never wither — but blossom 
all about me. In that I ion 




I find my 



despair!

Whatever your reasons were for that note of yours and for your 
indifferent evasion of my letters just previous to that note— the one 
thing that I still wish more than any other is that I could see you. 
It's tied up with even more than I've said here. And more impor- 
tantly, it is the one impulse I have that breaks through that film, 


that crust, which has gathered there so fatally between my true 
self and that which can make only mechanical gestures of living. 
But even if you should grant it, I wouldn't want to see you unless 
with some little warmth of friendliness and friendship on your 
part. . . . Nor should I want to see you at your office under any 
circumstances. That is not what I mean (because I have no specific 
matter to see you about now as I had when I first called upon you 
as a complete stranger, nor as I could have had, just before your 
last note when I wanted so badly to have you go over some of my 
most faulty poems with me), I have been feeling (with that feeling 
increasingly stronger) that I shall never again be able to recapture 
any sense of my own personal identity (without which I cannot 
write, of course— but in itself far more important than the writing) 
until I can recapture some faith in the reality of my own thoughts 
and ideas and problems which were turned into dry sand by your 
attitude toward those letters, and by that note of yours later. That 
is why I cannot throw off my desire to see you — not impersonally, 
but in the most personal ways, since I could never have written you 
at all in a completely impersonal fashion.

My feelings about you now are those of anger and indignation; and

You might as well take all your own literature and everyone else's

Department, so long as the people with the top-cream minds and 
the "finer" sensibilities use those minds and sensibilities not to make 
themselves more humane human beings than the average person, 
but merely as means of ducking responsibility toward a better 
understanding of their fellow men, except theoretically— which 
doesn't mean a God damned thing.

My attitude toward woman's wretched position in society and 
my ideas about all the changes necessary there, were interesting to 
you, weren't they, in so far as they made for literature? That my 
particular emotional orientation, in wrenching myself free from 
patterned standardized feminine feelings, enabled me to do some 
passably good work with 'poetry— ^Xi. that was fine, wasn't it — some- 
thing for you to sit up and take notice of! And you saw in one of 
my first letters to you (the one you had wanted to make use of, 
then, in the Introduction to your Paterson) an indication that my 
thoughts were to be taken seriously, because that too could be 
turned by you into literature, as something disconnected from life. 

But when my actual personal life crept in, stamped all over with 
the very same attitudes and sensibilities and preoccupations that you 
found quite admirable as literature— -that was an entirely different 
matter, wasn't it? No longer admirable, but, on the contrary, de- 
plorable, annoying, stupid, or in some other way unpardonable; 
because those very ideas and feelings which make one a writer with 
some kind of new vision, are often the very same ones which, in 
living itself, make one clumsy, awkward, absurd, ungrateful, con- 
fidential where most people are reticent, and reticent where one 




should be confidential, and which cause one, all too often, to step 
on the toes of other people's sensitive egos as a result of one's 
stumbling earnestness or honesty carried too far. And that they are 
the very same ones — that's important, something to be remembered 
at all times, especially by writers like yourself who are so sheltered 
from life in the raw by the glass-walled conditions of their own 
safe lives. 

Only my writing (when I write) is myself: only that is the real 
me in any essential way. Not because I bring to literature and to 
life two different inconsistent sets of values, as you do. No, / don't 
do that; and I feel that when anyone does do it, literature is turned 
into just so much intellectual excrement fit for the same stinking 
hole as any other kind. 

But in writing (as in all forms of creative art) one derives one's 
unity of being and one's freedom to be one's self, from one's rela- 
tionship to those particular externals (language, clay, paints, et 
cetera) over which one has complete control and the shaping of 
which lies entirely in one's own power; whereas in living, one's 
shaping of the externals involved, there . (of one's friendships, the 
structure of society, et cetera) is no longer entirely within one's 
own power but requires the cooperation and the understanding and 
the humanity of others in order to bring out what is best and most 
real in one's self. 

That's why all that fine talk of yours about woman's need to 
"sail free in her own element" as a poet, becomes nothing but empty 
rhetoric in the light of your behavior towards me. No woman will 
ever be able to do that, completely, until she is able first to "sail free 
in her own element" in living itself — which means in her relation- 
ships with men even before she can do so in her relationships with 
other women. The members of any underprivileged class distrust 
and hate the "outsider" who is one of them, and women therefore — 
women in general — will never be content with their lot until the 
light seeps down to them, not from one of their own, but from the 
eyes of changed male attitudes toward them — so that in the mean- 
time, the problems and the awareness of a woman like myself are 
looked upon even more unsympathetically by other women than 
by men. 

And that, my dear doctor, is another reason why I needed of you 
a very different kind of friendship from the one you offered me. 

I still don't know of course the specific thing that caused the 
cooling of your friendliness toward me. But I do know that if you 
were going to bother with me at all, there were only two things 
for you to have considered: (i) that I was, as I still am, a woman 
dying of loneliness — yes, really dying of it almost in the same way 
that people die slowly of cancer or consumption or any other such 




disease (and with all my efficiency in the practical world continu- 
ally undermined by that loneliness); and (r) that I needed des- 
perately, and still do, some ways and means of leading a writer's 
life, either by securing some sort of writer's job (or any other job 
having to do with my cultural interests) or else through some kind 
of literary journalism such as the book reviews— because only in 
work and jobs of that kind, can I turn into assets what are liabilities 
for me in jobs of a different kind. 

Those were the two problems of mine that you continually and 
almost deliberately placed in the background of your attempts to 
help me. And yet they were, and remain, much greater than whether 
or not I get my poetry published. I didn't need the publication of 
my poetry with your name lent to it, in order to go on writing 
poetry, half as much as I needed your friendship in other ways (the 
very ways you ignored) in order to write it. I couldn't, for that 
reason, have brought the kind of responsiveness and appreciation 
that you expected of me (not with any real honesty) to the kind 
of help from you which 1 needed so much less than the kind you 
withheld. 

Your whole relationship with me amounted to pretty much the 
same thing as your trying to come to the aid of a patient suffering 
from pneumonia by handing her a box of aspirin or Grove's cold 
pills and a glass of hot lemonade. I couldn't tell you that outright. 
And how were you, a man of letters, to have realized it when the 
imagination, so quick to assert itself most powerfully in the creation 
of a piece of literature, seems to have no power at all in enabling 
writers in your circumstances to fully understand the maladjust- 
ment and impotencies of a woman in my position? 

When you wrote to me up in W. about that possible censor job, 
it seemed a very simple matter to you, didn't it, for me to make all 
the necessary inquiries about the job, arrange for the necessary 
interviews, ^tart work (if I was hired) with all the necessary living 
conditions for holding down such a job, and thus find my life all 
straightened out in its practical aspects,' at least — as if by magic? 

But it's never so simple as that to get on one's feet even in the 
most ordinary practical ways, for anyone on my side of the railway 
tracks— which isn't your side, nor the side of your great admirer, 
Miss Fleming, nor even the side of those well cared for people like 
S. T. and S. S. who've spent most of their lives with some Clara or 
some Jeanne to look after them even when they themselves have 
been flat broke. 

A completely down and out person with months of stripped, bare 
hardship behind him needs all kinds of things to even get himself 
in shape for looking for a respectable, important white-collar job. 
And then he needs ample funds for eating and sleeping and keeping 


up appearances (especially the latter) while going around for vari- 
ous interviews involved. And even if and when a job of that kind is 
obtained, he still needs the eating and the sleeping and the carfares 
and the keeping up of appearances and what not, waiting for his 
first pay check and even perhaps for the second pay check since 
the first one might have to go almost entirely for back rent or some- 
thing else of that sort. 

And all that takes a hell of a lot of money (especially for a 
woman) — a lot more than ten dollars or twenty five dollars. Or 
else it takes the kind of very close friends at whose apartment one 
is quite welcome to stay for a month or two, and whose typewriter 
one can use in getting off some of the required letters asking for 
interviews, and whose electric iron one can use in keeping one's 
clothes pressed, et cetera — the kind of close friends that I don't have 
and never have had, for reasons which you know. 

Naturally, I couldn't turn to you, a stranger, for any such prac- 
tical help on so large a scale; and it was stupid of me to have mini- 
mized the extent of help I needed when I asked you for that first 
money-order that got stolen and later for the second twenty five 
dollars; — stupid because it was misleading. But the different kind of 
help I asked for, finally (and which you placed in the background) 
would have been an adequate substitute, because I could have car- 
ried out those plans which I mentioned to you in the late fall (the 
book reviews, supplemented by almost any kind of part-time job, 
and later some articles, and maybe a month at Yaddo this summer) 
without what it takes to get on one's feet in other very different 
ways. And the, eventually, the very fact that my name had ap- 
peared here and there in the book review sections of a few publi- 
cations (I'd prefer not to use poetry that way) would have enabled 
me to obtain certain kinds of jobs (such as an O. W. I. job for in- 
stance) without all that red tape which affects only obscure, un- 
known people. 

The anger and the indignation which I feel towards you now 
has served to pierce through the rough ice of that congealment 
which my creative faculties began to suffer from as a result of that 
last note from you. I find myself thinking and feeling in terms of 
poetry again. But over and against that is the fact that Fm even 
more lacking in anchorage of any kind than when I first got to 
know you. My loneliness is a million fathoms deeper, and my phys- 
ical energies even more seriously sapped by it; and my economic 
situation is naturally worse, with living costs so terribly high now, 
and with my contact with your friend Miss X having come off so 
badly. 

However, she may have had another reason for paying no atten- 
tion to that note of mine — perhaps the reason of having found out 




that your friendliness toward me had cooled — which would have 
made a difference to her, I suppose, since she is such a great "ad- 
mirer" of yours. But I don't know. That I*m in the dark about, too; 
and when I went up to the "Times" last week, to try, on my own, to 
get some of their fiction reviews (the "Times" publishes so many 
of those), nothing came of that either. And it's writing that I want 
to do — not operating a machine or a lathe, because with literature 
more and more tied up with the social problems and social progress 
(for me, in my way of thinking) any contribution I might be able 
to make to the wellfare of humanity (in war-time or peace-time) 
would have to be as a writer, and not as a factory worker. 

When I was very young, ridiculously young (of school-girl age) 
for a critical role, with my mind not at all developed and all my 
ideas in a state of first-week embryonic formlessness, I was able to 
obtain book-reviews from any number of magazines without any 
difficulty— and all of them books by writers of accepted impor- 
tance (such as Cummings, Babette Deutsch, H. D.) whereas now 
when my ideas have matured, and when I really have something to 
say, I can get no work of that kind at all. And why is that? It's 
because in all those intervening years, I have been forced, as a 
woman not content with woman's position in the world, to do a 
lot of pioneer living which writers of your sex and with your 
particular social background do not have thrust upon them, and 
which the members of my own sex frown upon (for reasons I've 
already referred to) — so that at the very moment when I wanted 
to return to writing from living (with my ideas clarified and en- 
riched by Jiving) there I was (and still am) — because of that living 
— completely in exile socially. 

I glossed over and treated very lightly (in my first conversation 
with you) those literary activities of my early girlhood, because 
the work in itself was not much better than that which any talented 
college freshman or precocious prep-school senior contributes to 
her school paper. But, after all, that work, instead of appearing in 
a school paper where it belonged, was taken so seriously by editors 
of the acceptably important literary publications of that time, that 
I was able to average as much as $ a week, very easily, from it. 
And I go into that now and stress it here; because you can better 
imagine, in the light of that, just how I feel in realizing that on the 
basis of just a few superficial (such as possessing a lot of appeal- 
ingly youthful sex-appeal and getting in with the right set) I was 
able to maintain my personal identity as a writer in my relationship 
to the world, whereas now I am cut off from doing so because it 
was necessary for me in my living, to strip myself of those super- 
ficials. 





You Ve never had to live. Dr. P— not in any of the by-ways and 
dark underground passages where life so often has to be tested. 
The very circumstances of your birth and social background pro- 
vided you with an escape from life in the raw; and you confuse that 
protection from life with an inability to live — and are thus able to 
regard literature as nothing more than a desperate last extremity 
resulting from that illusionary inability to live. (IVe been looking 
at some of your autobiographical works, as this indicates.) 

Imean) isn't something one just sks 
about. It happens to one, in a small way, like 
measles; or in a big way, like a leaking boat or an earthquake. Or 
else it doesn't happen. And when it does, then one must bring, as I 
must, one's life to literature; and when it doesn't then one brings to 
life (as you do) purely literary sympathies and understandings, the 
insights and humanity of words on paper only— and also, alas, the 
ego of the literary man which most likely played an important part 
in the change of your attitude toward me. That literary man's ego 
wanted to help me in such a way, I think, that my own achieve- 
ments might serve as a flower in his buttonhole, if that kind of help 
had been enough to make me bloom. 

But I have no blossoms to bring to any man in the way of either 
love or friendship. That's one of the reasons why I didn't want that 
introduction to my poems. And I'm not wanting to be nasty or 
sarcastic in the last lines of this letter. On the contrary a feeling of 
profound sadness has replaced now the anger and the indignation 
with which I started to write all this. I wanted your friendship more 
than I ever wanted anything else (yes, more, and I've wanted other 
I wanted it desperately, not because I have a single 
which to adorn any man's pride— but just because I 
haven't. 

Yes. the anger which I imagined myself to feel on all the previous 
pages, was false. I am too unhappy and too lonely to be angry; and 

if some of the things to which I have called your attention here 
should cause any change of heart in you regarding me, that would 
be just about the only thing I can conceive of as occurring in my 
life right now.

P. S. That I'm back here at  Pine Street causes me to add that 
that mystery as to who forged the "Cress" on that money order 
and also took one of Brown's checks (though his was not cashed, 
and therefore replaced later) never did get cleared up. And the 




janitor who was here at the time, is dead now. I don't think it was 
he took any of the money. But still I was rather glad that the post- 
office didn't follow it through because just in case Bob did have 
anything to do with it, he would have gotten, into serious trouble — 
which I shouldn't have welcomed, because he was one of those 
miserably underpaid negroes and an awfully decent human being 
in lots of ways. But now I wish it had been followed through after 
he died (which was over two months ago) because the crooks may 
have been those low vile upstate farm people whose year-round 
exploitation of down and out farm help ought to be brought to 
light in some fashion, and because if they did steal the money order 
and were arrested for it, that in itself would have brought to the 
attention of the proper authorities all their other illegal activities 
as well: And yet that kind of justice doesn't interest me greatly. 
What's at the root of this or that crime or antisocial act, both 
psychologically and environmentally, always interests me more. 
But as I make that last statement, I'm reminded of how much I'd like 
to do a lot of things with people in some prose — some stories, maybe 
a novel. I can't tell you how much I want the living which I need 
in order to write. And I simply can't achieve them entirely alone. 
I don't even possess a typewriter now, nor have even a rented one 
— and I can't think properly except on a typewriter. I can do poetry 
(though only the. first draft) in long-hand, and letters. But for any 
prose writing, other than letters, I can't do any work without a 
typewriter. But that of course is the least of my problems— the 
typewriter; at least the easiest to do something about. 

C 

Dr. P.: 

This is the simplest, most outright letter I've ever written to you; 
and you ought to read it all the way through, and carefully, be- 
cause it's about you, as a writer, and about the ideas regarding 
women that you expressed in your article on A. N M and because 
in regard to myself, it contains certain information which I did not 
think it necessary to give you before, and which I do think now 
you ought to have. And if my anger in the beginning makes you 
too angry to go on from there — well, that anger of mine isn't there 
in the last part, now as I attach this post-script. 

And if you don't (eel like reading it even for those reasons, will you 
then do so, please, merely out of fairness to me— much time and 
much thought and much unhappiness having gone into those pages. 




Book Three

Gties, for Oliver, were not a part of nature. He 
could hardly feel, he could hardly admit even when 
it was pointed out to him, that cities are a second 
body for the human mind, a second organism, more 
rational, permanent and decorative than the animal 
organism of flesh and bone: a work of natural yet 
moral art, where the soul sets up her trophies of ac- 
tion and instruments of pleasure. ,

The Library 



I love the locust tree 
the sweet white locust 

How much? 

How much? 
How much does it cost 
to love the locust tree 

in bloom? 

A fortune bigger than 
Avery could muster 

So much 

So much 
the shelving green 

locust 

whose bright small leaves 

in June 
lean among flowers 
sweet and white at

A cool of books 
will sometimes lead the mind to libraries 
of a hot afternoon, if books can be found 
cool to the sense to lead the mind away. 

For there is a wind or ghost of a wind 

in all books echoing the life 

there, a high wind that fills the tubes 

of the ear until we think we hear a wind, 

actual 



to lead the mind away* 



Drawn from the streets we break off 
our minds' seclusion and are taken up by 
the books' winds, seeking, seeking 
down the wind 

until we are unaware which is the wind and 
which the wind's power over us 

to lead the mind away 

and there grows in the mind 

a scent, it may be, of locust blossoms 

whose perfume is itself a wind moving 

to lead the mind away 

through which, below the cataract 

soon to be dry 

the river whirls and eddys 

first recollected. 

Spent from wandering the useless 
streets these months, faces folded against 
him like clover at nightfall, something 
has brought him back to his own 

mind 

in which a falls unseen 
tumbles and rights itself 
and refalls— and does not cease, falling 
and refalling with a roar, a reverberation 
not of the falls but of its rumor 

unabated 

Beautiful thing, 
my dove, unable and all who are windblown, 
touched by the fire 

and unable, 



a roar that (soundless) drowns the sense 
with its reiteration 

unwilling to lie in its bed 
and sleep and sleep, sleep 

in its dark bed. 

Summer! it is summer . 

— and still the roar in his mind is 

unabated 

The last wolf was killed near the Weisse Huis in the year 3

Run from it, if you will. So be it, 
(Winds that enshroud us in their folds — 
or no wind). So be it. Pull at the doors, of a hot 
afternoon, doors that the wind holds, wrenches 
from our arms — and hands. So be it. The Library 
is sanctuary to our fears. So be it. So be it. r 

— the wind that has tripped us, pressed upon 
us, prurient or upon the prurience of our fears 

— laughter fading. So be it. 

Sit breathless 
or still breathless. So be it. Then, eased 
turn to the task. So be it 1

Rose and I didn't know each other when we both went to the 
Paterson strike around the first war and worked in the Pagent. She 
went regularly to feed Jack Reed in jail and I listened to Big Bill

hands in Union Hall. And look at the damned thing now.

Beautiful thing! 

The Indians were accused of killing two or three pigs — this was 
untrue, as afterward proved, because the pigs had been butchered 
by the white men themselves. The following incident is concerned 
with two of the Indians who had been captured by Kieft's soldiers 
because of the accusations: The braves had been turned over to the 
soldiers, by Kieft, to do with as they pleased. 

The first of these savages, having received a frightful wound, 
desired them to permit him to dance the Kinte Kaye, a religious use 
among them before death; he received, however, so many wounds 
that he dropped dead. The soldiers then cut strips down the other's 
body. . . . While this was going forward Director Kieft, with his 
Councillor (the first trained physician in the colony) Jan de la 
Montagne, a Frenchman, stood laughing heartily at the fun, and 
rubbing his right arm, so much delight he took in such scenes. He 
then ordered him (the brave) to be taken out of the fort, and the 
soldiers bringing him to the Beaver's Path, he dancing the Kinte 
Kaye all the time, mutilated him, and at last cut off his head. 

There stood at the same time,  or  female savages, who had 
been taken prisoners, at the north-west corner of the fort: they held 
up their arms, and in their language exclaimed, "For shame! for 
shame! such unheard of cruelty was never known, or even thought 
of* among us." 

They made money of sea-shells. Bird feathers. Beaver skins. When 
a priest died and was buried they encased him with such wealth as 
he possessed. The Dutch dug up the body, stole the furs and left the 
carcass to the wolves that roamed the woods.

From 9 to 9 several crossed the falls on a tight rope (in the 
old pictures the crowd, below, on the dry rocks in their short sleeves 
and summer dresses look more like water-lilies or penguins than men 
and women staring up at them) : De Lave, Harry Leslie and Geo. 
Dobbs— the last carrying a boy upon his shoulders. Fleetwood Miles, 
a semi-lunatic, announced that he too would perform the feat but 
could not be found when the crowd had assembled. 

The place sweats of staleness and of rot 
a back-house stench . a 
library stench 

It is summer! stinking summer 

Escape from it — but not by running 

away. Not by "composition." Embrace the 

foulness 

— the being taut, balanced between 
eternities 

A spectator on Morris Mountain, when Leslie had gone out with 
a cookstove strapped to his back — tugged at one of the guy-ropes, 
either out of malice or idleness, so that he almost fell off. Having 
carried the stove to the center of the rope he kindled a fire in it, 
cooked an omelet and ate it. It rained that night so that the later 
performance had to be postponed. , 

But on Monday he did the Washerwoman's Frolic, in female attire, 
staggering drunkenly across the chasm, going backward, hopping on 
one foot and at the rope's center lay down on his side. He retired 
after that having "busted" his tights — to the cottage above for re- 
pairs. 

The progress of the events was transmitted over the new telephone 
to the city from the tower of the water works. The boy, Tommy 
Walker, was the real hero of these adventures. 




And as reverie gains and

the trick's done! 
Day is covered and we see you—

only the one thing— 

But you! 

—in your white lace dress 


Haunted by your beauty (I said), 
exalted and not easily to be attained, the 
whole scene is haunted: 

Take off your clothes, 

(I said) 

Haunted, the quietness of your face 
is a quietness, real 



out of no book. 

Your clothes (I said) quickly, while 
your beauty is attainable. 

Put them on the chair 
(I said. Then in a fury, for which I am 
ashamed) 

You smell as though you need 
a bath. Take off your clothes and purify 
yourself 

And let me purify myself 

— to look at you, 
to look at you (I said) 

(Then, my anger rising) TAKE OFF YOUR 

CLOTHES! I didn't ask you 

to take off your skin . I said your 

clothes, your clothes. You smell 

like a whore. I ask you to bathe in my 

opinions, the astonishing virtue of your 

lost body (I said) 

—that you might 
send me hurtling to the moon 

let me look at you (I 
said, weeping) 

Let's take a ride around, to see what the town looks like 

Indifferent, the indifference of certain death 
or incident upon certain death 
propounds a riddle (in the Joyceian mode — 

or otherwise, 

it is indifferent which) 

A marriage riddle: 




So much talk of the language — when there are no 
ears. 



What is there to say? save that 

beauty is unheeded . tho* for sale and 

bought glibly enough 

But it is. true, they fear 
it more than death, beauty is feared 
more than death, more than they fear death" 

Beautiful thing 

— and marry only to destroy, in private, in 
their privacy only to destroy, to hide 

(in marriage) 
that they may destroy and not be perceived 
in it — the destroying 

Death will be too late to bring us aid . 

What end but love, that stares death in the eye? 
A city, a marriage — that stares death 
in the eye 

The riddle of a man and a woman 

For what is there but love, that stares death 
in the eye, love, begetting marriage — 
not infamy, not death 

tho* love seem to beget 
only death in the old plays, only death, it is 
as tho' they wished death rather than to face 
infamy, the infamy of old cities 



<a world of corrupt cities, 
nothing else, that death stares in the eye, 
lacking love: no palaces, no secluded gardens, 
no water among the stones; the stone rails 
of the balustrades, scooped out, running with 
clear water, no peace . 

The waters 

are dry. It is summer, it is ended 

Sing me a song to make death tolerable, a song 
of a man and a woman: the riddle of a man 
and a woman. 

What language could allay our thirsts, 
what winds lift us, what floods bear us 

past defeats 

but song but deathless song ? 
The rock 

married to the river 

makes 

ho sound 

And the river 
passes — but I remain 
clamant 

calling out ceaselessly 
to the birds 
and clouds 

(listening) 

Who am I? 



— the voice! 



— the voice rises, neglected 
(with its new) the unfaltering 
language. Is there no release? 

Give it up. Quit it. Stop writing. 
"Saintlike" you will never 
separate that stain of sense, 

an offense 
to love, the mind's worm eating 
out the core, unappeased 

— never separate that stain 

of sense from the inert mass. Never. 

Never that radiance 

quartered apart, 
unapproached by symbols 

Doctor, do you believe in 
"the people," the Democracy? Do 
you still believe — in this 
swill-hole of corrupt cities? 
Do you, Doctor? Now? 

Give up 

the poem. Give up the shilly- 
shally of art. 

What can you, what 
can YOU hope to conclude — 
on a heap of dirty linen? 

— you 

a poet (ridded) from Paradise? 



Is it a dirty book? I'll bet 
it's a dixty book, she said.

Fire burns; that is the first law. 
When a wind fans it the flames 

are carried abroad. Talk 
fans the flames. They have 

manoeuvred it so that to write 
is a fire and not only of the blood. 

The writing is nothing, the being 
in a position to write (that's 

where they get you) is nine tenths 
of the difficulty: seduction 

or strong arm stuff. The writing 
should be a relief, 

relief from the conditions 

which as we advance become— a fire, 

a destroying fire. For the writing 
is also an attack and means must be 

found to scotch it — at the root 
if possible. So that 

to write, nine tenths of the problem 
is to live. They see 

to it, not by intellection but 

by sub-intellection (to want to be 

blind as a pretext for 

saying, We're so proud of you!

With due ceremony a hut would be constructed consisting of 
twelve poles, each of a different species of wood. These they run 
into the ground, tie them together at the top, cover them entirely 
with bark, skins or blankets joined close together. . Now here 
is where one sits who will address the Spirit of Fire, He- Who-Lies- 
Witli-His-Eyes-Bulging-In-The-Smoke-Hole . Twelve 
manittos attend him as subordinate deities, half representing animals 
and the others vegetables. A large oven is built in the house of sacri- 
fice . heated with twelve large red-hot stones. 

Meanwhile an old man throws twelve pipefuls of tobacco upon the 
hot stones, and directly another follows and pours water on them, 
which occasions a smoke or vapor almost powerful enough to 
suffocate the persons in the tent — 

Ex qua re, quia sicubi fumus adscendit in altum; ita sacrificulus, 
duplicata altiori voce, Kamtaka, karmaka! vel aliquando Hoo Hoo! 
faciem versus orientem convertit. 

Whereupon as the smoke ascends on high, the sacrificer crying 
with a loud voice, Kannaka, Kannaka! or sometimes Hoo> Hoo! 
turns his face towards the east. 

While some are silent during the sacrifice, certain make a 
ridiculous speech, while others imitate the cock, the squirrel and 
other animals, and make all kinds of noises. During the shouting 
two roast deer are distributed.

It started in the car barns of the street railway company, in die 
paint shop. The men had been working all day refinishing old cars 
with the doors and windows kept closed because of the weather 
which was very cold. There was paint and especially varnish being 
used freely on all sides. Heaps of paint soaked rags had been thrown 
fcito the corners. One of the cars took fire in the night. 

Breathless and in haste 

the various night (of books) awakes! awakes 
and begins (a second time) its song, pending the 
obloquy of dawn 

It will not last forever 
against the long sea, the long, long 
sea, swept by winds, the "wine-dark sea" 

A cyclotron, a sifting 

And there, 
in the tobacco hush : in a tepee they lie 
huddled (a huddle of books) 

antagonistic, 

and dream of 
gentleness — under the malignity of the hush 
they cannot penetrate and cannot waken, to be again 
active but remain — books 

that is, men in hell, 
their reign over the living ended 




Clearly, they say. Oh clearly! Clearly? 
What more clear than that of all things 
nothing is so unclear, between man and 
his writing, as to which is the man and 
which the thing and of them both which 
is the more to be valued 

When discovered it was a small blaze, though it was hot but it 
looked as tho' the firemen could handle it. But at dawn a wind came 
up and the flames (which they thought were subsiding) got suddenly 
out of control — sweeping the block and heading toward the business 
district. Before noon the whole city was doomed — 

Beautiful thing 

— the whole city doomed! And 

the flames towering 

like a mouse, like 
a red slipper, like 
a star, a geranium, 
a cat's tongue or —

pebble, an old man

The night was made day by the flames, flames 
on which he fed — grubbing the page 

(the burning page) 
like a worm — for enlightenment 

Of which we drink and are drunk and in the end 
are destroyed (as we feed). But the flames 
are flames with a requirement, a belly of their 
own that destroys — as there are fires that 
smolder 

smolder a lifetime and never burst 
into flame

So be it. So be it. 

An iron dog, eyes 
aflame in a flame-filled corridor. A drunkenness 
of flames. So be it. A bottle, mauled 
by the flames, belly-bent with laughter: 
yellow, green. So be it — of drunkenness 
survived, in guffaws of flame. All fire afire! 
So be it. Swallowing the fire. So be 
it. Torqued to laughter by the fire, 
the very fire. So be it. Chortling at flames 
sucked in, a multiformity of laughter, a 
flaming gravity surpassing the sobriety of 
flames, a chastity of annihilation. Recreant, 
calling it good. Calling the fire good. 
So be it. The beauty of fire-blasted sand 
that was glass, that was a bottle: unbottled. 
Unabashed. So be it. 



An old bottle, mauled by the fire 
gets a new glaze, the glass warped 
to a new distinction, reclaiming the 
undefined. A hot stone, reached 
by the tide, crackled over by fine 
lines, the glaze unspoiled 
Annihilation ameliorated: Hottest 
lips lifted till no shape but a vast 
molt of the news flows. Drink 
of the news, fluid to the breath. 
Shouts its laughter* crying out — by 
an investment of grace in the sand 
— or stone: oasis water. The glass 
splotched with concentric rainbows 
of cold fire that the fire has bequeathed 
there as it cools, its flame 
defied — the flame that wrapped the glass 
deflowered, reflowered there by 
the flame: a second flame, surpassing 
heat 

Hell's fire. Fire. Sit your horny ass 

down. What's your game? Beat you 

at your own game, Fire. Outlast you: 

Poet Beats Fire at Its Own Game! The bottle! 

the bottle! the bottle! the bottle! I 

give you the bottle! What's burning 

now, Fire? 

The Library? 

Whirling flames, leaping 
from house to house, building to building 



carried by the wind 



the library is in their path 

Beautiful thing! aflame 

a defiance of authority 
— burnt Sappho's poems, burned 
by intention (or are they still hid 
in the Vatican crypts?) : 

beauty is 

a defiance of authority : 

for they were 
unwrapped, fragment by fragment, from 
outer mummy cases of papier macte inside 
Egyptian sarcophagi 

flying papers 
from old conflagrations, picked up 
haphazard by thfe undertakers to make 
moulds, layer after layer 

for the dead 

Beautiful thing 

The anthology suppressed, revived even by 
the dead, you who understand nothing 
of this: 

Durer's Melancholy, the gears 
lying disrelated to the mathematics of the 
machine 

Useless, 

Beautiful thing, your 
vulgarity of beauty surpasses all their 
perfections! 


Vulgarity surpasses all perfections 
— it leaps from a varnish pot and we see 
it pass — in flames! 

Beautiful thing 

—intertwined with the fire. An identity 
surmounting the world, its core — from which 
we shrink squirting little hoses of 

objection — and 
I along with the rest, squirting 
at the fire 

Poet. 

Are you there? 

How shall I find examples? Some boy 

who drove a bull-dozer through 

the barrage at Iwo Jima and turned it 

and drove back making a path for the others — 

Voiceless, his 

action gracing a flame 

—but lost, lost 
because there is no way to link 
the syllables anew to imprison him 

No twist of the flame 
in his own image : he goes nameless 
until a Nik6 shall live in his honor — 

And for that, invention is lacking, 
the words are lacking: 

the waterfall of the 
flames, a cataract reversed, shooting 
upward (what difference does it make? ) 



The language, 



Beautiful thing— that I 
make a fool of myself, mourning the lack 
of dedication 

mourning its losses, 

for you 

Scarred, fire swept 
(by a nameless fire, that is unknown even 
to yourself) nameless, 

drunk. 

Rising, with a whirling motion, the person 
passed into the flame, becomes the flame — 
the flame taking over the person 

—with a roar, an outcry 
which none can afford (we die in silence, we 
enjoy shamefacedly— in silence, hiding 
our joy even from each other 

keeping 

a secret joy in the flame which we dare 
not acknowledge) 

a shriek of fire with 

i . .. - 

the upwind, whirling the room away — to reveal 
the awesome sight of a tin roof (0) 
entire, half a block long, lifted like a 
skirt, held by the fire — to rise at last, 
almost with a sigh, rise and float, float 
upon the flames as upon a sweet breeze, 
and majestically drift off, riding the air, 

sliding 



upon the air, easily and away over 
the frizzled elms that seem to bend under 
it, clearing the railroad tracks to fall 
upon the roofs beyond, red hot 
darkening the rooms 

(but not our minds) 

While we stand with our mouths open, 
shaking our heads and saying, My God, did 
ybu ever see anything like that? As though 
it were wholly out of our dreams, as 
indeed it is, unparalleled in our most sanguine 
dreams 

The person submerged 
in wonder, the fire become the person 

But the pathetic library (that contained, 
perhaps, not one volume of distinction) 
must go down also-* 

Because it is silent. It 
is silent by defect of virtue in that it 
contains nothing of you 

That which should be 
rare is trash; because it contains 
nothing of you. They spit on you, 
literally, but without you, nothing. The 
library is muffled and dead 

But you are the dream 

of dead men 



Beautiful Thing! 



Let them explain you and you will be ' 
the heart of the explanation. Nameless,

It is dangerous to leave written that which is badly written. 
A chance word, upon paper, may destroy the world. Watch 
carefully and erase, while the power is still yours, I say to 
myself, for all that is put down, once it escapes, may rot its 
way into a thousand minds, the corn become a black smut, and 
all libraries, of necessity, be burned to the ground as a con- 
sequence. 

Only one answer: write carelessly so that nothing that is 
not green will survive. 

There is a drumming of submerged 
engines, a beat of propellers. 
The ears are water. The feet 
listen. Boney fish bearing lights 
stalk the eyes — which float about, 
indifferent. A taste of iodine 
stagnates upon the law of percent- 
ages: thick boards bored through 
by worms whose calcined husks 
cut our fingers, which bleed

in time to see . from the roseate past a 
ribbed tail deploying

The remains— a man of gigantic stature— were transported on 
the shoulders of the most renowned warriors of the surrounding 
country . for many hours they travelled without rest. But half 
way on the journey the carriers had to quit overcome by fatigue — 
they had walked many hours and Pogatticut was heavy* So by the 
side of the trail, at a place called "Whooping Boys Hollow," they 
scooped out a shallow hole and laid the dead chieftain down in it 
while they rested. By so doing, the spot became sacred, held in 
veneration by the Indians. 

Arrived at the burial place the funeral procession was met by 
Pogatticut's brothers and their followers. There was great lamenta- 
tion and the Kinte Kaye was performed in sadness. 

Wyandach, the most illustrious brother, performed the burial 
sacrifice. Having his favorite dog, a much loved animal, brought 
forth, he killed him, and laid him, after painting his muzzle red, 
beside his brother. For three days and three nights the tribes 
mourned

You had him killed on me. 

About Merselis Van Giesen a curious story illustrative of the 
superstition of the day is to this effect: His wife was ill for a long 
time, confined to her bed. As she lay there, a black cat would come, 
night after night, and stare at her through the window, with wicked, 
blazing eyes. An uncanny fact about this visitation was that no one 
else could see the cat. That Jane was bewitched was the belief of the 
whole neighborhood. Moreover, the witch who exercised this spell, 
and who made these weird visits to the sufferer, in the guise of a cat 

invisible to everybody but the bewitched, was believed to be Mrs. B. 
who lived in the gorge in the hill beyond. 

Happy souls! whose devils lived so near. 

Talking the matter 4 over with his neighbors, Merselis (he was 
called "Sale") was told that if he could shoot the spectral cat with 
a silver bullet he would kill the creature, and put a stop to the spells 
exercised over his wife. He did not have a silver bullet, but he had 
a pair of silver sleeve buttons. 

Who of us thinks so fast to switch the category 
of our loves and hatreds? 

Loading his gun with one of these buttons, he seated himself 
on the bed beside his wife, and declared his intention of shooting 
the witch cat. But how could he shoot a creature he could not see? 

Are we any better off? 

"When the cat comes," said he to his wife, "do you point out 
just where it is, and I will shoot at that spot." So they waited, she 
in a tremor of hope and dread — hope that the spells afflicting her 
would soon be ended; dread that some new torment might come to 
her from this daring attempt of her husband; he, in grim determina- 
tion to forever end the unholy power exercised over his wife by 
Mrs. B., in the guise of the invisible feline. Long and silently they 
waited. 



—what a picture of marital fidelity! dreaming as one. 

At last, when their feelings had been wrought up, by the suspense 
to the highest pitch, Jane exclaimed "There is the black cat!" 
"Where?" "At the window, it's walking on the sill, it is in the 
lower left-hand corner!" Quick as a flash "Sale" raised his gun and 
fired the silver bullet at the black cat which he could not see. With 
a snarl that was a scream the mysterious creature vanished forever 
from the gaze of Mrs. Van Giesen, who from that hour began to 
recover her health. 

The next day "Sale" started out on a hunt through what is now 
known as Cedar Cliff Park. On the way he met the husband of the 
suspected witch. There was the usual exchange of courteous 
neighborly inquiries regarding the health of their respective fam- 
ilies. Mr. B. said his wife was troubled with a sore on her leg for 
some time. "I would like to see that sore leg," said "Sale." After 
some demur he was taken to the house, and on one plea or another 
was finally permitted to examine the sore. But what particularly 
attracted his notice was a fresh wdurid, just where his silver sleeve 
button had struck the unfortunate creature when she had last 
visited his wife in the form of the spectral black witch cat! Needless 
to say Mrs. B. never mpre made those weird visitations. Perhaps it 
was from a sense of thanksgiving for her miraculous deliverance 
that Mrs. Van Giesen joined the First Presbyterian Church on 
Confession, Sept. , 3. Merselis Van Giesen was assessed in 7 
for  acres of unimproved land, two horses and five cattle.

speakeasies of those days. But one night they came leaping down- 
stairs from the banquet hall tearing their clothes" off, the women 
throwing their skirts over their heads, and joined in the dancing, 
naked, with the others on the main floor. He took one look and 
then went out the back window just ahead of the police* in his

At this depth the attempt to bore through the red sandstone was

other salt mines of Europe, is found in rocks of the same age as 
this, raises the question whether it may not also be found here.

When the water has receded most things have lost their 
form. They lean in the direction the current went. Mud 
covers them 

— fertile(?)mud. 

If it were only fertile. Rather a sort of muck, a detritus, 

in this case — a pustular scum, a decay, a choking 

lifelessness — that leaves the soil clogged after it, 

that glues the sandy bottom and blackens stones — so that 

they have to be scoured three times when, because of 

an attractive brokenness, we take them up for garden uses. 

An acrid, a revolting stench comes out of them, almost one 

might say a granular stench — fouls the mind 

How to begin to find a shape— to begin to begin again, 
turning the inside out : to find one phrase that will 
lie married beside another for delight . ?

Where the dredge dumped the fill, 
something, a white hop-clover 
with cordy roots (of iron) gripped 
the sand in its claws — and blossomed 
massively, where the old farm 
was and the man broke his wife's 
cancerous jaw because she was , 
too weak, too sick, that is, to 
\vork in the field for him as he 
thought she should 

So thinking, he composed 
a song to her: 

to entertain her 
in her reading: 

# # 

The birds in winter 
and in summer the flowers 
those are her two joys 
«~-to cover her secret sorrow 

Love is her sorrow 

over which at heart 

she cries for joy by the hour

Weeping and singing songs, the scouts bear the dead warrior to 
p forest glade called Owokafai — the place of those slain by sudden 
death. They lay him on a bed made of fresh leaves. Then they cut 
young branches from a sacred tree and wave the bough over the 
genital organs of the warrior to extract the spirit of fertility into 
the leaves. Knowledge of the rites must be kept from men and 
from unmarried girls. Only married women, who have felt the 
fertility of men in their bodies, can know the secret of life. To 
them it was entrusted by their great goddess "in the days when 
woman, not man, was the dominant sex. . ; on the guarding of 
this secret depended the strength of the tribe. Were the rites once 
disclosed — few or no babies would be born, barns and herds would 
yield but scanty increase, while the arms of future generations of 



fighting men would lose their strength and hearts their courage/* 
This ceremony is conducted to the accompaniment of low, wailing 
chants, which only these wives of warriors have authority to sing, 
or even to know.

I was thinking about her all day long yesterday. You know she's 
been dead four years? And that son of a bitch only has one more 
year to serve. Then he'll be out and we can't do a thing about it. — 
I suppose he killed her. — You know he killed her, just shot her to 
death. And do you remember that Clifford that used to follow her 
around, poor man? He'd do anything she asked him to — the most 
harmless creature in the world; he's been sick. He had rheumatic 
fever when he was a child and can't leave the house any more. He 
wrote to us to send him some dirty jokes because he can't get out 
to hear them himself. And we can't either of us think of one new 
one to send him.

Look, Big Shot, I refuse to come home until you promise to cut 
out the booze. It's no use your talking about Mother needs 
me and all that bologney. If you thought anything of her you 
wouldn't carry on the way you do. Maybe your family did 
once own the whole valley. Who owns it now? What you 
need is to be slapped down.

But you'd rather hit the bottle. 

That's all right with me — only I won't wrestle with you all

What sort of people do you come from, Phyllis? 

My father's a drunk. 

That's more humility than the situation demands. 
Never be ashamed of your origins. 

I'm not. It's just the truth. 

The truth! Virtue, my dear, if one had it! is only 
interesting in the aggregate, as you will discover , or per- 
haps you have already found it so. That's our Christian teach- 
ing: not denial but forgiveness, the Prodigal Daughter. Have 
you ever been to bed with a man? 

Have you? 

Good shot! With this body? I think I'm more 
horse than .woman. Did you ever see such skin as mine? 
Speckled like a Guinea hen 

Only their speckles are white.

Phyllis, good morning. Could you stand a drink at 
this early hour? I've written you a poem . and the worst 
is, I'm about to read it to you . You don't have to like it. 
But, hell take it, you damn well better listen to it. Look at 
me shake! Or better, let me give you a short one, to begin 
with:

Is that so? Well, you know where you can get off at. And don't 
think you can start coming in here. Because if you do  never 
go home. And you haverit stopped drinking! Don't try to kid me. 

Alright, if you think I'm in danger then learn to behave yourself. 
Are you a weakling or something? But I won't go through all 
that again. Never. Don't worry, as I told you, I can take care of 
myself. And if anything happens to me, so what? Blame it on I've

Dear Pappy: 



For the last time! 

All day today, believe it or not, we've been coasting along what 
they call up here the North Shore on our way to the place we're 
going to fish at. It sounds like an Italian dinner, Anticosti, but it's 
really french. 

It's wild, they say, but we have a marvellous guide, an Indian I 
think but it's not sure (maybe I'll marry him and stay up there for 
the rest of my life) Anyway he speaks french and the Missis talks 
to him in that language. I don't know what they're saying (and I 
don't care, I can talk my own language) . 

I can hardly keep my eyes open, I've been out almost every night 
this week. To go on. We have wine* mostly Champagne on board. 
She showed it to me,  cases for the party but I don't want any of 
it, thanks. I'll stick to my rum and coke. Don't worry. Tell Ma 
everything's all right. But remember, I'm through.

Dear Doctor: 

In spite of the grey secrecy of time and my own self -shuttering 
doubts in these youthful rainy days, I would like to make my pres- 
ence in Paterson known t d you, and I hope you will welcome this 
from me, an unknown young poet, to you, an unknown old poet, 
who live in the same rusty county of the world. Not only do I 
inscribe this missive somewhat in the style of those courteous sages 
of yore who recognized one another across the generations as 
brotherly children of the muses (whose names they well know) 
but also as fellow citizenly Chinamen of the same province, whose 
gastanks, junkyards, fens of the alley, millways, funeral parlors, 
river-visions— aye! the falls itself— are images white-woven in their 
very beards. 

I went to see you once briefly two years ago (when I was ), 
to interview you for a local newspaper. I wrote the story in fine 
and simple style, but it was hacked and changed and came out the 
next week as a labored joke at your expense which I assume you 
did not get to see. You invited me politely to return, but I did not, 




as I had nothing to talk about except images of cloudy light, and 
was not able to speak to you in your own or my own concrete 
terms. Which failing still hangs with me to a lesser extent, yet I feel 
ready to approach you once more. 

As to my history: I went to Columbia on and off since 3, 
working and travelling around the country and aboard ships when 
I was not in school, studying English. I won a few poetry prizes 
there and edited the Columbia Review. I liked Van Doren most 
there. I worked later on the Associated Press as a copyboy, and 
spent most of the last year in a mental hospital; and now I am 
back in Paterson which is home for the first time in seven years. 
What I'll do there I don't know yet— my first move was to try and 
get a job on one of the newspapers here and in Passaic, but that 
hasn't been successful yet. 

My literary liking is Melville in Pierre and the Confidence Man, 
and in my own generation, one Jack Kerouac whose first book 
came out this year. 

I do not know if you will like my poetry or not—that is, how 
far your own inventive persistence excludes less independent or 
youthful attempts to perfect, renew, transfigure, and make con- 
temporarily real an old style of lyric machinery, which 1 use to 
record the struggle with imagination of the clouds, with which I 
have been concerned. I enclose a few samples of my best writing. 
All that I have done has a program, consciously or not, running on 
from phase to phase, from the beginnings of emotional breakdown, 
to momentary raindrops from the clouds become corporeal, to a 
renewal of human objectivity which I take to be ultimately identical 
with no ideas but in things. But this last development I have yet 
to turn into poetic reality. I envision for myself some kind of new 
speech— different at least from what I have been writing down — in 
that it has to be clear statement of fact about misery (and not 
misery itself), and splendor if there is any" out of the subjective 
wanderings through Paterson. This place is as I say my natural 
habitat by memory, and I am not following in your traces to be 
poetic: though I know you will be pleased to realize that at least 
one actual citizen of your community has inherited your experience 
in his struggle to love and know his own world-city, through your 
work, which is an accomplishment you almost cannot have hoped 
to achieve. It is misery I see (like a tide out of my own fantasy) but 
mainly the splendor which I carry within me and which all free 
men do. But harking back to a few sentences previous, I may need a 
new measure myself, but though I have a flair for your style I 
seldom dig exactly what you are doing with cadences, line length, 




sometimes syntax, eta, and cannot handle your work as a solid 
object— which properties I assume you rightly claim. I don't un- 
derstand the measure. I haven't worked with it much either, though, 
which must make the difference. But I would like to talk with you 
concretely on this. 

I enclose these poems. The first shows you where I was 
% years ago. The second, a kind of dense lyric I instinctively try to 
imitate-^after Crane, Robinson, Tate, and old Englishmen. Then, 
the Shroudy Stranger (3) less interesting as a poem (or less sincere) 
but k connects observations of things with an old dream of the 
void—I have real dreams about a classic hooded figure. But this 
dream has become identified with my own abyss — and with the 
abyss of old Smokies under the Erie R.R.. tracks on straight street 
>— so the shroudy stranger (4) speaking from the inside of the old 
wracked bum of Paterson or anywhere in America. This is only 
a half made poem (using a few lines and a situation I had in a 
dream). I contemplated a long work on the shroudy stranger, his 
wanderings. Next (5) an earlier poem, Radio City, a long lyric 
written in sickness. Then a mad song (to be sung by Groucho Marx 
to a Bop background.) (6), The (7) an old style ballad-type ghost 
dream poem. Then, an ode to the Setting Sun of abstract (8) ideas, 
written before leaving the hospital, and last an Ode to Judgment, 
which I just wrote, but which is unfinished. (9) What will come 
of all this I do not know yet. 

I know this letter finds you in good health, as I saw you speak 
at the Museum in N. Y. this week. I ran backstage to accost you, 
but changed my mind, after waving at you, and ran off again. 

Respectfully yours, 
AG.

The Constitution says: To borrow money on the credit of the 
United States. It does not say: To borrow money from Private 
bankers. 

To explain the fallacies and illusions upon which our present 
method of financing the national budget is based would take too 
much space and time. To win the cold war we must reform our 
finance system. The Russians understand only force. We must be 
stronger than they and build more airplanes. 

FINANCE THE BUILDING OF AIRPLANES AS FOLLOWS: 

x* Pay the manufacturer with a NATIONAL CREDIT CER- 
TIFICATE. 

2. Manufacturer deposits the Certificate with his bank the same as 
a check. 

3. Banker returns National Credit Certificate to Treasury Dept.* 
which opens UNITED STATES NATIONAL CREDIT for 
banker. 

4. Banker in turn now opens BANKER'S CREDIT for depositor. 
Manufacturer draws checks against his credit as usual. 

5. Manufacturer pays his workers with checks upon his bank. 

6. Treasury Dept. pays Jbanker a service charge of 1% for han- 
dling the Treasury transaction. If the airplanes cost 1 million dol- 
lars the banker's profit would be $,. 

WHAT DO WE ACCOMPLISH BY USING THIS SYSTEM? 

1. Manufacturer is paid in full. 

2. Workers are paid in full. 

3. Bankers make a $,. profit every time he handles a 1 million 
dollar National Credit Certificate. 

4. We do not add to the National Debt. 

5. We do not have to increase federal taxation. 

6*. The only cost of the 1 million dollar airplane is only $,, the 
cost of the banker's service charges. 

7. We can build  airplanes for the price of one. 

I would like to have some smart economist or banker stick out 
his neck and contradict one single claim I present herewith to the 
nation.

Jonathan, bap. Oct. , 2; m..Gritie (Haring?). He was born 
and brought up at Hoppertown (Hohokus), but in 9 was run- 
ning the grist and saw-mill at Wagaraw, now owned by the Alyeas. 
On the night of April , 9, his wife was aroused by a noise as 
of someone trying to get into the lower part of the mill, where, 
for better security, he kept his horses. "Yawntan," said she in 
Dutch, "someone is stealing your horses." Lighting a lantern, he 
threw open the upper half -door and challenged the marauders. In- 
stantly a shot was fired through the lower half -door, wounding him 
in the abdomen. He staggered back into the house and fell upon a 
bed; covering himself up in the blankets. A party of Tories, masked 
and disguised, rushed in, and, compelling his young wife to hold 
a candle, they savagely attacked the prostrate form. Once he seized 
one of the bayonettes and holding it for a moment, cried at his as- 


this is an old grudge." With 
inhuman savages bayonetted him, until with a groan he expired. 
His two infant children who were wont to sleep in a trundle bed 
beneath his, were horrified spectators of their father's massacre. 
After the murderers were gone, his wife and a neighbor took the 
blood out of the bed in double handfuls. The murdered man had 
received nineteen or twenty cruel bayonette thrusts. It was believed 

cal or pecuniary considerations than from motives of private re- 
venge. Hopper was a captain in the Bergen County militia. One of 
his children was Albert, bap. Oct. 6, 6. It is said that Jonathan's 
children removed to Cincinnati, and there attained some promi- 
nence.

an old friend, now gone 



—while he was still 

in the hotel business, a tall and rather beautiful young woman came 
to his desk one day to ask if there were any interesting books to 
be had on the premises. He, being interested in literature, as she 
knew, replied that his own apartment was full of them and that, 
though he couldn't leave at the moment — Here's my key, go up 
and help yourself. 

She thanked him and 

went off. He forgot all about her. 

After lunch he too 

went to his rooms not remembering until he was at the door that 
he had no key. But the door was unlatched and as he entered, a 
girl was lying naked on the bed. It startled him a little. So much 
so that all he could do was to remove his own clothes and lie be* 
side her. Quite comfortable, he soon fell into a heavy sleep. She 
also must have slept.

I think she did; some 

people, not many,

It's in them.

The whereabouts of Peter the Dwarfs grave was unknown un- 
til the end of the last century, when, in 5, P. Doremus, under- 
taker, was moving bodies from the cellar of the old church to 
make room for a new furnace, he disinterred a small coffin and 
beside it a large box. In the coffin was the headless skeleton of what 
he took to be a child until he opened the large box and found 
therein an enormous skull. In referring to the burial records it was 
learned that Peter the Dwarf had been so buried.

In a deep-set valley between hills, almost hid 
by dense foliage lay the little village. 
Dominated by the Falls the surrounding country 
was a beautiful wilderness where mountain pink 
and wood violet throve: a place inhabited only 
by straggling trappers and wandering Indians. 




A print in colors by Paul Sandby, a well known 

water color artist of the eighteenth century, 

a rare print in the Public Library 

shows the old Falls restudied from a drawing 

made by Lieut. Gov. Pownall (excellent work) as he 

saw it in the year 1 . 

The wigwam and the tomahawk, the Totowa tribe 

On either side lay the river-farms resting in 

the quiet of those colonial days: a hearty old 

Dutch stock, with a toughness to stick and 

hold fast, although not fast in making improvements. 

Clothing homespun. The people raised their own 
stock. Rude furniture, sanded floors, rush 
bottomed chair, a pewter shelf of Brittania 
ware. The wives spun and wove — - many things 
that might appear disgraceful or distasteful today 
The Benson and Doremus estates for years were 
the only ones on the north side of the river. 

Dear Doc: Since I last wrote I have settled down more, am working 
on a Labor newspaper (N. J. Labor Herald, AFL) in Newark. The 
owner is an Assemblyman and so I have a chance to see many of 
the peripheral intimacies of political life which in this neighbor- 
hood has always had for me the appeal of the rest of the land- 
scape, and a little more, since it is the landscape alive and busy. 

Do you know mat the west side of City Hall, the street, is 
nicknamed the Bourse, because of the continual political and bank- 
ing haggle and hassel that goes on there? 

Also I have been walking the streets and discovering the bars — 
especially around the great Mill and River streets. Do you know 
this part of Paterson? I have seen so many things — negroes, gypsies, 
an incoherent bartender in a taproom overhanging the river, filled 
with gas, ready to explode, the window facing die river painted 
over so that the people can't see it. I wonder if you have seen 
River Street most of all, because that is really at the heart of what 
is to be known. 




I keep wanting to write you a long letter about deep things I 
can show you, and will some day — the look of streets and people, 
events that have happened here and there. 

A.G. 

« * 

There were colored slaves. In  1 only ten 
houses, all farm houses save one, The Godwin 
Tavern, the most historic house in Paterson, 
on River Street: a swinging sign on a high 
post with a full length picture of Washington 
painted on it, giving a squeaking sound when 
touched by the wind. 

Branching trees and ample gardens gave 
the village streets a delightful charm and 
the narrow old-fashioned brick walls added 
a dignity to the shading trees. It was a fair 
resort for Summer sojourners on their way 
to the Falls, the main object of interest. 

The sun goes beyond Garrett Mountain 
as evening descends, the green of its pine 
trees, fading under a crimson sky until 
all color is lost. In the town candle light 
x appears. No lighted streets. It is as dark 
as Egypt. 

There is the story of the cholera epidemic 
the well known man who ref used to bring his 
team into town for fear of infecting them 
but stopped beyond the river and carted his 
produce in himself by wheelbarrow — to the 
old market, in the Dutch style of those days. 




Paterson, N. J., Sept.  — Fred Goodell Jr., twenty-two, was ar- 
rested early this morning and charged with the murder of his six- 
months-old daughter Nancy, for whom police were looking since 
Tuesday, when Goodell reported her missing. 

Continued questioning from last night until 1 ajn. by police 
headed by Chief James Walker drew the story of the slaying, 
police said, from the $-a-week factory worker 4 few hours after 
he refused to join his wife, Marie, eighteen, in taking a lie detector 
test. 

At 2 ajn. Goodell led police a few blocks from his house to a 
spot on Garrett Mountain and showed them a heavy rock under 
which he had buried Nancy, dressed only in a diaper and placed 
in a paper shopping bag. 

Goodell told the police he had killed the child by twice snapping 
the wooden tray of a high chair into the baby's face Monday morn- 
ing when her crying annoyed him as he was feeding her. Dr. 
George Surgent, the county physician, said she died of a fractured 
skull. 

There was an old wooden bridge to Manchester, as 
Totowa was called in those days, which 
Lafayette crossed in 4, while little 
girls strewed flowers in his path. Just 
across the river in what is now called the Old 
Gun Mill Yard was a nail factory where 
they made nails by hand. 

I remember going down to the old cotton 
mill one morning when the thermometer was 
down to  degrees below on the old bell 
post. In those days there were few steam 
whistles. Most of the mills had a bell post 
and bell, to ring out the news, "Come to work!" 

Stepping out of bed into a snow drift 
that had sifted in through the roof; then, 
after a porridge breakfast, walk 
five miles to work. When I got there I 
did pound the anvil for sartin', to keep 
up circulation. 




In the early days of Paterson, the breathing 
spot of the village was the triangle square 
bounded by Park Street (now lower Main St.) 
and Bank Street. Not including the Falls it 
was the prettiest spot in town. Well shaded 
by trees with a common in the center where 
the country circus pitched its tents. 
On the Park Street side it ran down to 
the river. On the Bank Street side it ran 
to a roadway leading to the barnyard of 
the Goodwin House, the barnyard taking up 
part of the north side of the park. 

The circus was an antiquated affair, only 
a small tent, one ring show. They didn't 
allow circuses to perform in the afternoon 
because that would close up the mills. Time 
in those days was^ precious. Only in the 
evenings. But they were sure to parade their 
horses about the town about the time the 
mills stopped work. The upshot of the 
matter was, the town turned out to the circus 
in the evening. It was lighted 

in those days by candles especially 
made for the show. They were giants fastened 
to boards hung on wires about the tent, 
a peculiar contrivance. The giant candles 
were placed on the bottom boards, and two 
rows of smaller candles one above the other 
tapering to a point, forming a very pretty 
scene and giving plenty of light. 

The candles lasted during the performance 
presenting a weird but dazzling spectacle 
in contrast with the showy performers — 



Many of the old names and some of the 
places are not remembered now: McCurdyV 
Pond, Goffle Road, Boudinot Street. The 
Town Clock Building. The old-fashioned 
Dutch Church that burned down Dec. ,  1 
as the clock was striking twelve midnight. 
Collet, Carrick, Roswell Colt, 
Dickerson, Ogden, Pennington 
The part of town called Dublin 
settled by the first Irish immigrants. If 
you intended residing in the old town you'd 
drink of the water of Dublin Spring. The 
finest water he ever tasted, said Lafayette. 

Just off Gun Mill yard, on the gully

Paterson, N. J., January 9, 0: — The murder last night of 
two pers&ns living at the Goffle, within two or three miles of this 
place has thrown our community into a state of intense excitement. 
The victims are John S. Van Winkle -and his wife, an aged couple, 
and long residents of this county. The atrocious deed was accom- 
plished as there appears no doubt by one John Johnson, a laboring 
farmer, and who at the time was employed by some of his neigh- 
bors in the same capacity. So far as we have been able to gather 
the particulars, it would seem that Johnson effected an entrance 
into the house through an upper window, by means of a ladder, 
and descending to the bedroom of his victims below, accomplished 
his murderous purpose by first attacking the wife who slept in 
front, then the husband, and again the wife. 

The second attack appears to have immediately deprived the 
w;fe of life; the husband is still living but his death is momentarily 
expected. The chief instrument used appears to have been a knife, 
though the husband bears one or more marks of a hatchet. The 




hatchet was found next morning either in bed or on the floor, and 
the knife on the window sill, where it was left by the murderer in 
descending to the ground. 

A boy only slept in the same dwelling The fresh snow, 

however, enabled his pursuers to find and arrest their man. .... 
His object was doubtless money (which, however, he seemed not 
to have obtained).. 

Johnson inquired why they had tied him, "what have I done?" 
, . * He was taken to the scene of murder and shown the 
objects of his barbarous cruelty, but the sight produced no other 
sensible effect than to extort from him an expression of pity, he 
denying any knowledge of participation in the inhuman butchery.

Oh that the rocks of the Areopagus had 
kept their sounds, the voices of the law! 
Or that the great theatre of Dionysius 
could be aroused by some modern magic 

to release 
what is bound in it, stones! 
that music might be wakened from them to 
melt our ears 

The sea is not our home 

— though seeds float in with the scum 
and wrack . among brown fronds 
and limp starfish 

Yet you will come to it, come to it! The 
song is in your ears, to Oceanus

Dear Bill; 

I wish you and F. could have come. It was a grand day and we 
missed you two, one and all missed you. Forgetmenot, wild col- 
umbine, white and purple violets, white narcissus, wild anemones 
and yards and yards of delicate wild windflowers along the brook 
showed up at their best. We didn't have hard cider or applejack 
this time but wine and vodka and lots of victuals. . . . The 




erstwhile chicken house has been a studio for years, one D.E. envied 
when he saw it and it has been occupied by one person or another 
writing every summer when I am here which has been pretty con- 
tinuously for some time. The barn too has a big roomy floor which 
anyone who finds a table and a chair in space enlivening is welcome 
to. E.*s even fondled the idea of "doing something" about the barn 
and I wish they would. Their kids went in bathing in the brook, 
painted pictures and explored. If you ever feel like coming and get 
transportation please come. E.*ll be up again before leaving Prince- 
ton in June. They will be in H. next year. J.G. is occupying the 
"Guest House" now. 

How lovely to read your memories of the place; a place is made of 
memories as well as the world around it. Most of the flowers were 
put in many years ago and thrive each spring, the wild ones in some 
new spot that is exciting to see. Hepatica and bloodroot are now 
all over the place, and trees that were infants are now tall crea- 
tures filled this season with orioles, some rare warbler like the 
Myrtle and magnolia warblers and a wren has the best nest in the 
garage (not to be confounded with any uptodate shelter) where I 
had a coat lines with shipskin hanging and the wren simply used it 
to back her nest against where she is sitting warm and pretty on 
five eggs. 

Best wishes and love from everyone who was here

Dear Dr. Williams: 

Thanks for your introduction. The book is over in England be- 
ing printed, and will be out in July sometime. Your foreword is 
personal and compassionate and you got the point of what has 
happened. You should see what strength & gaiety there is beyond 
that though. The book will contain . . . I have never 
been interested in writing except for the splendor of actual experi- 
ence etc. . bullshit, I mean I've never been really crazy, con- 
fused at times. 


I am leaving for the North pole this time on a ship in a few weeks. 
. . . I'll see icebergs and write great white polar rhapsodies. 
Love to you, back in October and will pass thru Paterson to see 
family on way to a first trip to Europe. I have NOT absconded 




from Paterson. I do have a whitmanic mania & nostalgia for cities 
and detail & panorama and isolation in jungle and pole, like the 
images you pick up. When I've seen enough I'll be back to splash in 
the Passaic again only with a body so naked and happy City Hall 
will have to call out the Riot Squad. When I come back 1* make 
big political speeches in the mayoralty campaigns like I did when 
I was 1 6 only this time I'll have W. C. Fields on my left and 
Jehovah on my right. Why not? Paterson is only a big sad poppa 
who needs compassion. In any case Beauty is where I hang 
my hat. And reality. And America. 

There is no struggle to speak to the city, out of the stones etc. 
Truth is not hard to find . . . I'm not being clear, so Til 
shut up . . I mean to say Paterson is not a task like 
Milton going down to hell, it's a flower to the mind too etc etc

The whores grasping for your genitals, faces almost 
pleading . . "two dolla, two dolla" till you almost go in 
with the sheer brute desire straining at your loins, the whisky and 
the fizzes and the cognac in you till a friend grabs you 
"no . . . to a real house, this is shit." A reel house, a real 
house? Casa real? Casa de putas? and then the walk through the 
dark streets, joy of living, in being drunk and walking with other 
drunks, walking the streets of dust in a dusty year in a dusty cen- 
tury where everything is dust but you are young and you are 
drunk and there are women ready to love for some paper in your 
pocket. Through the streets with dozens of bands of other soldiers 
(they are soldiers even with civilian clothes, soldiers as you are 
but different and this band is different because you are you — and 
drunk and Baudelaire and Rimbaud and a soul with a book in it 
and drunk) a woman steps into the open door of a cafe and puts 
her hand between her legs and smiles at you . . . at you a 
whore smiles! And you yell back and all yell back and she yells 
and laughs and laughter fills . . . the . * . guitar 
soaked night air. 

And then the house, . . ... and see a smooth faced girl 
against a door, all white . . * . snow, the virgin, O bride

clean hair of her and the beauty of her body in the orchid stench, 
in the vulgar assailing stench the fragility and you walk and sway 
across the floor, and reel against the door and push away the voice 
that embraces your ear dancers and find her, still standing against 
the door and she is smooth-faced and wants four dollars but you 




make it three but four she says and you argue and her hand on your 
belly and she moves it and four and you can hear the music spin- 
ning out its tropical redness the beer you gulp and touch the 
breast, the firmness FOUR no three and smile a girl is carried out 
of the room by a soldier (bride eternal) smile FOUR no three the 
hand! the breast, you touch grasp hold lust feel the curve of a 
buttock silent-smooth sliding under your palm, the dress, the hand! 

High heels clack clack laughs nose and her eyes are black and 
four? please and you pay four? no . three . and then yes 
four, quatro . . quatro dolares but twice, I go twice, 
'andsome, come on, 'andsome. A child you follow her, the light 
whirling in your eyes the noise the other girls in the babel friends' 
voices unintelligible, edged with laughter the face at which you 
smile though there is nothing to smile at but smile absurdly because 
making love to a whore is funny but it is not funny as her blood 
beneath flesh, her fingers fragile touch yours in rhythm not 
funny but heat and passion blight and white, brighter-white than 
lights of the whorehouses, than the gin fizz white, white and deep 
as birth, deeper than death.

There is a woman in our town

in worn slacks upon the street 
where I saw her. 

neither short 
nor tall, nor old nor young 
her 

face would attract no 

: 

adolescent. Grey eyes looked 
straight before her. 

Her 

hair 

was gathered simply behind the 
ears under a shapeless hat. 

Her 

hips were narrow, her 

legs 

thin and straight. She stopped 

me in my tracks — until I saw 
her 

disappear in the crowd. 

An inconspicuous decoration 
made of sombre cloth, meant 
I think to be a flower, was 
pinned flat to her 

right 

breast — any woman might have 
done the same to 
say she was a woman and warn 
us of her mood. Otherwise 



she was dressed in male attire, 
as much as to say to hell 
with you. Her 

expression was 

serious, her 

feet were small. 
And she was gone! 

if ever I see you again 
as I have sought you 
daily without success 

FU speak to you, alas 
too late! ask, 

What are you doing on the 

streets of Paterson? a 

thousand questions: 

Are you married? Have you any 

children? And, most important, 
your NAME! which 
of course she may not 

give me — though 
I cannot conceive it

intelligent woman

Knocking around with Rapp and the Rhythm Kings put the 
finishing touches on me and straightened me out. To be with 
those guys made me know that any white man if he thought 
straight and studied hard, could sing and dance and play with the 
Negro. You didn't have to take the finest and most original and 
honest music in America and mess it up because you were a white 
man; you "could dig the colored man's real message and get in there 
with him, like Rapp. I felt good all over after a session with the 
Rhythm Kings, and I began to miss that tenor sax. 
Man, I was gone with it — inspiration's mammy was with me. And 
to top it all, I walked down Madison Street one day and what I 
heard made me think my ears were lying. Bessie Smith was shout- 
ing the Downhearted Blues from a record in a music shop. I flew 
in and bought up every record they had by the mother of the blues 
— Cemetery Blues, BleedirC Hearted, and Midnight Blues — then 
I ran home and listened to them for hours on the victrola. I was 
put in a trance by Bessie's moanful stories and the patterns of true 
harmony in the piano background,, full of little runs that crawled 
up and down my spine like mice Every note that woman wailed 
vibrated on the tight strings of my nervous system: every word 
she sang answered a question I was asking. You couldn't drag me 
away from that victrola, not even to eat.

(Q. Mr. Williams, can you tell me, simply, what poetry is? 

A. Well . . . I would say that poetry is language charged 
with emotion. It's words, rhythmically organized 
A poem is a complete little universe. It exists separately. Any 
poem that has worth expresses the whole life of the poet. It 
gives a view of what the poet is. 

Q. All right, look at mis part of a poem by £. £. Cummings, an- 
other great American poet:

&&& 

Is this poetry? 

A. I would reject it as a poem. It may be, to him, a poem. But 

1 would reject it. I can't understand it. He's a serious man. 
So I struggle very hard with it — and I get no meaning 
at aH 

Q. You get no meaning? But here's part of a poem you your- 
self have written: ... "2 partridges/ 2 mallard 
ducks/ a Dungeness crab/  hours out/ of the Pacific/ and 

2 live-frozen/ trout/ from Denmark . . . " Now, 
that sounds just like a fashionable grocery list! 




A. It is a fashionable grocery list. 
Q, Well — is it poetry? 

A. We poets have to talk in a language which is not English. It 
is the American idiom. Rhythmically it's organized as a sam- 
ple of the American idiom. It has as much originality as jazz. 
If you say "2 partridges, 2 mallard ducks, a Dungeness crab" 
— if you treat that rhythmically, ignoring the practical sense, 
it forms a jagged pattern, ft is, to my mind, poetry. 

Q. But if you don't "ignore the practical sense' 1 . . . you 
agree that it is a fashionable grocery list. 

A. Yes. Anything is good material for poetry. Anything. I've 
said it time and time again. 

Q« Aren't we supposed to understand it? 

A. There is a difference of poetry and the sense. Sometimes 
modern poets ignore sense completely. That's what makes 
some of the difficulty . The audience is confused 

by the shape of the words. 

Q. But shouldn't a word mean something when you see it? 

A. In prose, an English word means what it says. In poetry, 
you're listening to two things , . you're listening 
to the sense, the common sense of what it says. But it says 
more. That is the difficulty.

Peter Brueghel, the elder, painted 
a Nativity, painted a Baby 
new born! 
among the words. 

Armed men, 
savagely armed men 

armed with pikes, 
halberds and swords 
whispering men with averted faces 
got to the heart 

of the matter 
as they talked to the potbellied 
greybeard (center) 
the butt of their comments, 
looking askance, showing their 
amazement at the scene, 
features like the more stupid 
German soldiers of the late 
war 

— but the Baby (a^from an 
illustrated catalogue 

in colors) lies naked on his Mother's 
knees 

— it is a scene, authentic 
enough, to be witnessed frequently 
among the poor (I salute 

the man Brueghel who painted 
what he saw — 

many times no doubt 
among his own kids but not of course 
in this setting) 



The crowned and mitred heads 
of the 3 men, one of them black, 
who had come, obviously from afar 
(highwaymen? ) 
by the rich robes 
they had on — offered 
to propitiate their gods 

Their hands were loaded with gifts 

— they had eyes for visions 
in those days — and saw, 
saw with their proper eyes, 
these things 

to the envy of the vulgar soldiery 
He painted 

the bustle of the scene, 
the unkernpt straggling 
hair of the old man in the 
middle, his sagging lips 

incredulous 

that there was so much fuss 

about such a simple thing as a baby 

born to an old man 

out of a girl and a pretty girl 

at that 

But the gifts! (works of art, 
where could they have picked 
them up or more properly 
have stolen them? ) 

— how else to honor 

an old man, or a woman? 



— the soldiers' ragged clothes, 

mouths open, 

their knees and feet 

broken from  years of 

war, hard campaigns, their mouths 

watering for the feast which 

had been provided 

Peter Brueghel the artist saw it 
from the two sides: the 
imagination must be served — 
and he served 

dispassionately 

It is no mortal sin to be poor — anything but this featureless 
tribe that has the money now — staring into the atom, com- 
pletely blind — without grace or pity, as if they were so many 
shellfish. The artist, Brueghel, saw them . : the 
suits of his peasants were of better stuff, hand woven, than we 
can boast. 

- have come in our time to the age of shoddy, the men are 
shoddy, driven by their bosses, inside and outside the job to 
be done, at a profit. To whom? But not true of the Portuguese 
mason, his own boss "in the new country" who is building a 
wall for me, moved by oldworld knowledge of what is "virtu- 
ous" . "that stuff they sell you in the stores nowa- 
days, no good, break in your hands . that manufac- 
tured stuff, from the factory, break in your hands, no care 
what they turn out . . ") 

The Gospel according to St. Matthew, Chapter 1, verse ,— 
Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When a§ his mother 
Miriam * was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she 
was found with child of the Holy Ghost. 

* The King James version, of course, reads "Mary " but it is 
recalled that Dr. Williams often referred to the mother of Jesus 
as Miriam." Cf. the Hebrew Miryam as root for both names. — Ed. 


 Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to 
make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily. 

 But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the 
Lord, appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of 
David, fear not to take unto thee Miriam thy wife: for that which 
is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. 

Luke . . But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them 
in her heart.

Dear Bill:

I am told by a dear friend in Paris, G.D. who is married to Henri 
Matisse's daughter, and who is the one vibrant head I have met in 
Europe, that France today is ruled by the gendarme and the con- 
cierge. In socialist Denmark I knew a highly intelligent author, a 
woman, who had come to America and there had a child by a 
wretched scribbler. Poor and forsaken she had returned to Copen- 
hagen, where she earned her niggard indigence doing review* for 
the Politiken, and giving occasional lectures on Middle Kngltfth and 
early Danish. She lived in the slummy part of that beautiful dry, 
trying to support a wonderful boy, sturdy, loving, and very mat* 
culine. It was my joy to bring him oranges, chocolate, and thoM 
precious morsels which his mother could not afford. She told Hit 
that the socialist police had called on her one night, asking why 
she had not paid her taxes to the government. Poverty wai (iff 
reply. Do you recall the epitaph on Thomas Churchyard*! tomb* 
stone? . . . 'Poverty and Obscurity doth thin tomb §fM 
close.* A week later they returned, threatening to removt h*f fwf* 
niture and have it impounded by the government. When lite Igftlfi 
pleaded that if she gave what Kroners she had her little boy would 
starve, the police said: 'We went to the Vin Handel I«m fVftttflfj 
and learned from the proprietor that you had benight a boillt m 



tit 



wine; if you can afford to drink wine you certainly can pay your 
taxes.' She then said 1 am so poor, and so driven to despair by it 
that I had to have a bottle of wine to relieve me of my melancholia.' 

I am quite sure too that people only have the kind of govern- 
ment that their bellies crave. Furthermore, I cannot cure one soul 
in the earth. Plato took three journeys to Dionysius, the Tyrant 
of Syracuse, and once was almost killed and on another occasion 
was nearly sold into slavery because he imagined that he influenced 
a devil to model his tyranny upon The Republic. Seneca was the 
teacher of Nero, and Aristotle tutored Alexander of Macedon. 
What did they teach? 

We are content here because it is cheap; my wife can eat Cha- 
teaubriand for seven pesetas, about  or  cents. Going to the 
shops in the morning is a ritual; there is the greeting from the 
woman who runs the panaderia, and the salutation (courtesy al- 
ways eases the spirit and relieves the nervous system), from the 
man or his wife at the lecheria (where you get milk, and an ex- 
pansive smile from the humble woman who sells you three pesetas 
worth of helio, ice) . . . , 

Edward 

Paterson has grown older 

the dog of his thoughts 

has shrunk 

to no more than "a passionate letter" 
to a woman, a woman he had neglected 
to put to bed in the past . 

And went on 

living and writing 



letters 

and tending his flower 
garden, cutting his grass and trying 
to get the young 

to foreshorten 




their, errors in the use of words which 
he had found so difficult, the errors 
he had made in the use of the 
poetic line: 

" . die unicorn against a millefieurs background, 

There's nothing sentimental about the technique of writing. It can't 
be learned, you'll say, by a fool. But any young man with a mind 
bursting to get out, to get down on a page even a clean sentence 
— gets courage from an older man who stands ready to help him — 
to talk to. 

A flight of birds, all together, 

seeking their nests in the season 

a flock before dawn, small birds 

"That slepen al the night with open ye," 

moved by desire, passionately, they 

have come a long way, commonly. 

Now they separate and go by pairs 

each to his appointed mating. The 

colors of their plumage are undecipherable 

in the sun's glare against the sky 

but the old man's mind is stirred 

by the white, the yellow, the black 

as if he could see them there. 

Their presence in the air again 
calms him. Though he is approaching 
death he is possessed by many poems. 
Flowers have always been his friends, 
even in paintings and tapestries 
which have lain through the past 
in museums jealously guarded, treated 
against moths. They draw him imperiously 




to witness them, make him think 

of bus schedules and how to avoid 

the irreverent — to refresh himself 

at the sight direct from the th 

century what the old women or the young 

or men or boys wielding their needles 

to put in her green thread correctly 

beside the purple, myrtle beside 

holly and the brown threads beside: 

together as the cartoon has plotted it 

for them. All together, working together — 

all the birds together. The birds 

and leaves are designed to be woven 

in his mind eating and 

all together for his purposes 

— the aging body 

with the deformed great-toe nail 
makes itself known 

coming 

to search me out — with a 
rare smile 

among the thronging flowers of that field 
where the Unicorn 

is penned by a low 

wooden fence 

in April! 

the same month 
when at the foot of the post 

he saw the man dig up 
the red snake and kill it with a spade. 
Godwin told me 
its tail 

would not stop wriggling till 
after the sun 

goes down — 




he knew everything 

or nothing 

and died insane 
when he was still a young man 



The (self) direction has been changed 
the serpent 

its tail in its mouth 
"the river has returned to its beginnings" 
and backward 

(and forward) 
it tortures itself within me 

until time has been washed finally under 
and "I knew all (or enough) 
it became me . " 

— the times are not heroic 
since then = . * 

but they are cleaner 

and freer of disease 
the mind rotted within them 
we'll say 

the serpent 

has its tail in its mouth 
AGAIN! 

the all-wise serpent 

Now I come to the small flowers 

that cluster about the feet 
of my beloved 

— the hunt of 



the god of love 

of virgin birth 



The mind is the demon 
drives us . well, 
would you prefer it to 
turn vegetable and 

wear no beard? 



— shall we speak of love 

seen only in a mirror 

— no replica? 
reflecting only her impalpable spirit? 

which is she whom I see 

and not touch her flesh? 

The Unicorn roams the forest of all true 
lovers' minds. They hunt it down. Bow wow! sing hey the 
green holly! 

— every married man carries in his head 

the beloved and sacred image 
of a virgin 

whom he has whored 

but the living fiction 
a tapestry 
silk and wool shot with silver threads 

a milk-white one-horned beast 

I, Paterson, the King-self 

saw the lady 

through the rough woods 

outside the palace walls 
among the stench of sweating horses 
and gored hounds 

yelping with pain 
the heavy breathing pack 

to see the dead beast 

brought in at last 


across the saddlebow 

among the oak trees. 
Paterson, 

keep your pecker up 

whatever the detail! 

Anywhere is everywhere: 
You can learn from poems 

that an empty head tapped on 
sounds hollow 
in any language! The figures 
are of heroic size. 

The woods 
are cold though it is summer 

the lady's gown is heavy 

and reaches to the grass. 



All about, small flowers fill the scene. 

A second beast is brought in 
wounded. 
And a third, survivor of the chase, 

lies down to rest a while, 
his regal neck 
fast in a jeweled collar. 

A hound lies on his back 
eviscerated 
by the beast's single horn. 

Take it or leave it, 

if the hat fits — 
put it on. Small flowers 

seem crowding to be in on the act: 
the white sweet rocket, 
on its branching stem, four petals 
one near the other to 

fill in the detail 



from frame to frame without perspective 

touching each other on the canvas 
make up the picture: 

the cranky violet 

like a knight in chess, 

the cinque-foil, 

yellow faced — 

this is a French 

or Flemish tapestry — 
the sweetsmelling primrose 

growing close to the ground, that poets 
have made famous in England, 
I cannot tell it all: 

slippered flowers 

crimson and white, 

balanced to hang 
on slender bracts, cups evenly arranged upon a stern, 
foxglove, the eglantine 
or wild rose, 
pink as a lady's ear lobe when it shows 
beneath the hair, 

campanella, blue and purple tufts 
small as forget-me-not among the leaves. 

Yellow centers, crimson petals 
and the reverse, 
dandelion, love-in-a-mist, 
cornflowers, 

thistle and others 
the names and perfumes I do not know. 

The woods are rilled with holly 
(I have told you, this 
is a fiction, pay attention), 

the yellow flag of the French fields is here 
and a congeries of other flowers 




as well: daffodils 

and gentian, the daisy, columbine 



myrtle, dark and light 

and calendulas 



The locust tree in the morning breeze 
outside her window 

where one branch moves 

quietly 

undulating 

upward and about and 

back and forth 

does not remind me more 

than of an old woman's smile 

— a fragment of the tapestry 

preserved on an end wall 

presents a -young woman 
with rounded brow 
lost in the woods (or hiding) 
announced 

(that is, the presentation) 
by the blowing of a hunter's horn where he stands 
all but completely hid 

in the leaves. She 
interests me by her singularity, 
her courtly dress 

among the leaves, listening! 

The expression of her face, 

where she stands removed from the others 

— the virgin and the whore, 

an identity, 

both for sale 



to the highest bidder! 

and who bids higher 

than a lover? Come 
out of it if you call yourself a woman. 

I give you instead, a young man 

sharing the female world 

in Hell's despight, graciously 

— once on a time 

on a time: 

Caw! Caw! Caw! 
the crows cry! 

In February! in February they begin it. 
She did not want to live to be 

an old woman to wear a china doorknob 
in her vagina to hold her womb up — but 

she came to that, resourceful, what? 
He was the first to turn her up 

and never left her till he left her - 
with chUd, as any soldier would 

until the camp broke up. 

She maybe was "tagged" as Osamu 
Dazai and his saintly sister 

would have it 

She was old when she saw her grandson: 
You young people 

think you know everything. 



She spoke in her Cockney accent 
and paused 

looking at me hard: 
The past is for those that lived in the past. Cessa! 

— learning with age to sleep my life away: 
saying ; 

The measure intervenes, to measure is all we know, 
a choice among the measures 
the measured dance 

"unless the scent of a rose 

startle us anew" 

Equally laughable 

is to assume to know nothing, a 
chess game 
massively, "materially," compounded! 

Yo ho! taho! 

We know nothing and can know nothing 

but 

the dance, to dance to a measure 
contrapuntally, 

Satyrically, the tragic foot.
