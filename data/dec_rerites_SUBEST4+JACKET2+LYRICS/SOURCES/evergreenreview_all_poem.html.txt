		Seventeen sonnets by Shakespeare of Stratford	

That would defy time, physic's onslaught and havoc,  

Yet could not beget time's most timely desire,	    

Could not convince me otherwise, 

 

 

That I might reverse my fate and not remake 
	

The same mistakes rooted blood makes.  

And thus aging matter procured nothing that death itself    

Could not achieve in a less untimely fashion, 

 

 

Mirror's mirror on the wall, unseemly flesh, 


When mirror's specter is reversed and falls;
  

And upon that dying gray mantle we rest, and wonder not    

Where all appearances and reflections led. 

 



At eighteen you taught me how to see
      The woman who had vanished into air
      Taught me how to see the white wall
    On which the mind paints the colours
      Of its loss, and certainty of loss.
      In you I learned to know what seeing was:
      More than taking things in
      It was the ever-increasing line of trees
      As the car speeds towards the desert
      Where trees are nothing more than 
    Interruptions in the sorry blankness of things.
      You taught me that the blind man
      Can safely travel to the sun, provided he takes
      His cane of ice and does not expect
      Any woman to travel there with him.
    And what does he look for when he
      Gets there? the boy asked.
      He looks for his shadow, you replied,
      But not in words, just a silence
      That was a shadow falling on the mouth. 






Say you wake

At 3:22 AM, alone.

The kitchen is bare

So is the street.

So much so your mind

Dreams multitudes

To compensate, again.

There is no redemption 

From some things

Only a deepening that

Unsettles as much as it

Strengthens our will

To rejoin the heart’s

Ragged army. Morning

Will come soon, but

That changes nothing

Or changes little.




It should’ve happened long ago

But it didn’t. At some point a Metro-North was missed,

And so we said, “We’d leave the following

Morning.” But we wasted the morning feeling off.  

 

There was no time left for touchstones: 

The getting up and stepping into love. 

There was a hardwood floor and a table 

(mahogany), long squares of sun passing

 

Through, though the intersection of the light,

The floor and the table took us only

Almost onto the threshold of feeling 

That the other would be the one who’d come 

 

And say, “The landscape’s awaiting us

Our arrival into the Moonie meadow increasing 

Incrementally through the days, and yes

Yes, I’ll watch you as you age beneath the branch.” 



  It's 5 a.m. in Chengdu China
  I can't sleep
a wink

  Staring out the window
  water drips on dishes
  in the sink

  A bike goes by
  a young gal sits
  side-saddle on the back

  looks like Bhudda's angel daughter
  sent from heaven
  dressed in black

  She glances up
  her dark eyes
  make the morning come to life

  Suddenly I realize
  long ago this angel
was my wife

  Wanted now to tell her
  when we married
  many years ago

  That I never would have left her
  if I knew then
  what I now know

  Waited for what seemed
  1000 years to see
  those eyes again

  Hoping someday I could tell her
  that our love
  would never end

  Never dared to tell her then
  because of all the love
  we shared

  It was more than I could handle
  even though
  I really cared

  Now it's many lifetimes later
  here in Chengdu
5 a.m.

  My favorite wife
  from an earlier life
  the sweetest one of all of them

  Once she told me in our lifetime
  our true love
would never die

  And that even if I left her
  Bhudda's angel
  still would fly

  Now she tells me broken hearts
  will all heal themselves
  in time

  And that all the pain I caused her
  now is gone
  except for mine

  Now in Chengdu
  through the window
  she's come back to me again

  Riding on the back seat
  of a bike
side-saddle with her friend

  Guess that since she passed me by
  there's only one thing
  I can do

  Get myself a new gal
  and a bicycle
  that's built for two

  When in this reincarnation
when I've found
a brand new bride

  Maybe I'll find out
  it's Bhudda's angel
  riding by my side

  Telling me wherever
  we have been
  and through whichever life

  Through all our reincarnations
  she has always been
  my wife

  Now its 7 in the morning
  Chengdu streets
are filled with light

  I'm still staring out the window
  as the day
  is growing bright

  Waiting by the window
  need to see
  my true love's eyes again

  when she rides by
on her bicycle
  side–saddle with her friend

  Then I'll tell her that I love her
  this time I know
what to do

  Waiting by the window
  for my Bhudda angel
  in Chengdu

 


When Harper is at home on her own,
  She keeps the light off so it won’t burn out.
  It is only switched on for good books and gatherings
  of her best friends and their best friends too.

Early in the morning, camping in the country,
  the sun burns straight through the day.
  Wasted in her sleep, light sets cold
  just when she needs a bulb the most.

The trip was planned before him.
  Now, after him, she may as well have come.
  Before she left,
  she unplugged all of her appliances.
  [a quirk he witnessed and said he loved]

Uncertainty swells:
  (in night’s time of siring)
  the backdoor, the hall light,
  her skitter-scattering of feelings of him ...
  unlocked, left on,
  latent ...

Harper–stuck in dark on public land
  remembers her youth:
  throwing sand back into the ocean
  to stop the encroaching waves;
  taping fall leaves to their branches
  to stem the tide of autumnal colors
  piled dead on the sidewalk.

And worst: desperately counting times
  at church she crossed herself for prayer
  because to her, an accidental odd number
  brought the next week under the bright gaze
  of God’s piercing realm.
  She’d leave in a panic–
  is God off or on?

Now, she only has faith in Esther,
  the computer, [visibly unplugged] who will know
  the time and date exactly – unjudging –
  even if it is years until Harper returns
  the electricity to her system.

 

  
 

 Where
is the lord of that chateau?
Where the watchman, where the guard?
Cracks of age are in the sky.
The birds are diving toward the pond.

The
leaves would teach the soil shame.
  It does not know the taste of blood.
An abstinent could never be so thirsty.
Every sip will make it want another.

The
naked man is piping out a tune.
The naked god has put his lyre down,
but canvas cannot put aside
its attributes, and even the painter
did not put down his name, his age.

Where
are the witnesses? Where are the knives? 

 

 Ascending
with a shout into the sky
  is not a common human thing. It seems
  ascension is reserved for holy virgins
  and their martyred sons. We fall into
  abysses or each other's arms, we fall
  from jungle gyms in schoolyards covered with
  graffiti, letters swimming past our eyes,
  singing with the icons on our walls.
  They hum their endless lullabies, but we
  are not allowed to sleep. We have to sing
  along for chorus after chorus. Rising,
  we stumble through hallucinations to
  where toilet seats and bathroom mirrors open
  to receive us - and then we're falling in -
  to our reflections.

  Let me sniff your ass

 

 

 



Like a dog
    I get sensation
    It can’t be that pure
    There’s nothing wrong with that 

 

The dog goes frantic, barking
  Aprile

It’s snowing in New Hampshire
    Snowing in Tompkins Square

To smelly clubs to hear
  Loud bad rock music
  And that’s good

I don’t know why I’m doing anything
Well, that’s not entirely true
I do know I’m doing things that are
not entirely for myself
That is giving me some kind of ballast
Am I putting God in front of me?
I don’t believe in god, but I’m putting
something in front of me
It’s the idea that I myself am 
not that significant, even to myself
It’s quite liberating, really
I’m feeling that I can do all these things
and there are really other people
other animals and plants that 
could conceivably be the beneficiaries



But this doesn’t relieve me
of the idea that I might need
actually to know what I’m doing
and why 

 

 

 

 

IV. 


   
  
 
  

 

 

There is a reason to lose our senses
    as we get to be old
And that is not to feel that the final end is so
    terrible
If we are, so to speak, infantilized, then what we
    encounter
May be merely a kind of odd discomfort, a pain
As from infancy we are accustomed to suffering, and cry
Out our lungs when we are unable to verbalize what we
    feel
And I feel that looking toward others will bring an
    easing
Of that anxiousness I have so often felt, that music
Can help a little, but more it is the ability to look
To others, to see that one is just a small part of the
    picture
So time goes by, others into others, and we are here
And the thing that holds me still is to be by my
    children
To see them happy, the telephone rings, champagne
It is a new year again, we are by the beach again
And we are able to say that we are not unhappy
Everyone is feeling good as they shoot into the sky
But we all know the harrowing lives nearby that are
Bitter and poor, in the sense of not having enough
Poetry can’t mean that much, everyone asleep
Another year, another weight of looking and thinking
About everyone, and then there is just music 
And people walking by the shore, their humble 
Bodies, their self-desires, their anguish, I see
I am a poet, I step on the same sand as Homer



 

 

 

 

 



  He must be twice
her age at least 
With mottled, wrinkled skin 
His hair is dyed a bottle-black 
His face is wintry thin. 

Blue veins snake
down his bone hands 
Like roots of ancient trees 
He wears a pair of checkered shorts 
Above his scrawny knees. 

The girl he's with
is beautiful 
Her shoulder-length black hair 
Surrounds and frames her dark brown face 
Her shoulders soft and bare. 

He drinks his
Mekhong whiskey down 
And orders yet again
The girl he's with just sighs and sneaks 
a smile at other men. 


They sit in
silence, the silly old man
And the girl who stole his heart 
Someone should whisper in his ear 
"Too many years apart!" 

Someone should
whisper in his ear 
"Your girl is bored to death! 
Your eyelids droop, your shoulders stoop 
There's whiskey on your breath!" 

Someone should
whisper in his ear 
That if he didn't pay 
He might just find his lady love 
Would soon be on her way. 

He wallows in her
loving gaze 
So puppy-dog serene 
Serenity for her of course 
His ATM machine. 

 But he might
whisper in our ears 
"Well, don't you think I know?
I made my choice and so will you 
With fewer years to go." 

I'm not sure what
to make of him 
There is no guiding rule 
I wonder if he could be both 
A wise man and a fool. 

He turns his head
to pay the bill 
And suddenly I see
It's a mirror on the wall 
The silly old man is me. 



 


Wine drops were driven, claw hammers,
  through the foreheads of derelicts.
  Five suns burned out in my hand.
 
Plant managers drained workers’ blood
and transfused them with diesel fuel.
  I wanted to save them but could not.

Bored store clerks pushed syringes
of blue stars into their veins.
  Black stones fell from my mouth.

Someone dismembered a boy
and left his heart in the parking garage.
  Five suns burned out in my hand.

A crowd of strangers surrounded me,
  their minds full of rusting razor blades.
  I wanted to save them but could not.

Skeletons sat in echoing houses and beat
each other with wrist bones and femurs.
  Black stones fell from my mouth.

We carried dead children through our days.
They lay in state in our brains’ crystal coffins.
Five suns burned out in my hand.

A black moon drank black constellations
  from a black sky.
  I wanted to save them but could not.

People woke, rinsed faces with dead engine oil.
  Blood blisters bloomed like small pox spots.
  Black stones fell from my mouth.

Five suns burned out in my hand.
  I wanted to save them but could not.
  Black stones fell from my mouth.

 

 




 
I¹d like to say your beauty overwhelmed me;
  your slender back in maroon sweater,
  steel-denimed thighs withdrew my eyes, &
  I missed. To meet your gaze,
  I would swear your pale cheeks
  gold-framed, adorned with pink-
  carnation smile commenced a different game
  between us. Breathing your skin¹s mock perfume
  of cigarettes & whiskey, I¹d confess
  with desire¹s love I threw the first game.
  Or the fifth. To win by losing,
  my victory your happiness. Yet,
  should you return through double doors
  out of the cold that was your absence,
  I¹d tell you nothing, dropping coins on the table
  to earn a rematch, pretending not to want
  that other game a man & woman play.




 

 

    

The child’s hair
    is the color of spice
    grandfather made
    a living by, her eyes
    dark as coffee
    father sold in the market
    everyday, energetic hopeful
    eyes that are quiet
    darkness now.

 You can’t scent
      death in the desert,
      the air is that dry,
      and her picture
      in the evening
      paper is that dry,
      you can’t smell
      her place on the corner
      of those nameless
      broken streets–            

but you can taste
      the wormwood
      bitterness of her days,
      the sweet spices spilled
      irretrievably amid grains
      of sand, the bloodline all
      poured out like anointing
      oils from a ewer, all lost
      irrevocably amid the crude.            

Now the child keeps
      the mother, her spice
      hair attracting a few bold
      young ladies. She defies
      the wagging fingers,
      the unveiled curses
      her thin hands resolutely
      twining and entwining,
      playing hide and seek
      among the clove
      and cardamom, weaving
      through the family
      tapestry, reciting Qur’an
      under her breath. 

 
I am
sorting out dreams that take
place in sometime when never was,
in old prop planes with cracked vinyl
seat covers lengthed like diner booths,

 browned-red
worn and landing in the dark
bare boned tree land with split wood fences
  where I am sorting out people who never
acted or when acting, never acted

"out"
or
"put on" for any-body but themself

aaaaa
and
aaaaaaaaaathen

seldom.
Though, here Dad wagging, like old
bro says, I no recollection. I am sorting out
wind in my hair and no one there who does
not understand me. For I am sorting out fact 

from
fiction, non-plussed by it. Plus dreams

of you,
naked; me holding you pressed up
against me dressed and then your making
bed next to bed on floor from sheets with
pillows thrown comforter in semi-circle I am

with.
  and sorting out dreams

 aaaaa
of
aaaaaaaayou.




 

Ides
of March
April, the cruellest month

You were precocious.

  How cold felt that gunmetal tip
against your thinning pained wrinkled lips ?
how slow, infinite eon minutes
of hesitation
reeling off life, ancestors, shtetls -- paintings ?
how hard the shaking steel on your
curled away tongue tasting
acrid -- metallic --oily ?

The crack
exploding
your brain, burst
tympanums in a nanosecond
  image-time travel - recoil
kicking lose a tooth,
you cut the light to the loneliest
a most definite exit not
with a whimper.

A dark
crimson trickle of a stain
on your feather pillow.
What time was it ? as if that mattered
how cold were you
to your mate's touch ?
  did she scream-roar with a voice
unknown to her, as
I did then twelve years before ? 



 

 

 

 

 


  1       



      A seaside town and the smell of iodine on the beach.
      A town square, just like in Sicily, and dancing.
      The sophisticated son of a common family
    Is aiming for the position of Rosencrantz.       



      He has decided to serve Claudius and he watches
      The prince of the blood closely from behind the fountain.
      The whole world is a prison, and in the world’s courtyard
    A certain John plays the piano.       



      Darkness is coming and the end approaches.
      Ophelia screams in the empty barracks
      And Hamlet walks around, wrapped in a white bandage
    So that the ghost might recognize him in the darkness.

      The Tower of Babel fell on Wednesday.
      Everything is buried under the rubble.
      Speechless men celebrate their triumph.
    Griboedov’s remains return to Nina       



      Chavchavadze. There is much grief to come.
      They will build time on an optical illusion.
      I am tired, you are tired, we are tired — exhaustion
    Has become our space, and our sense, and our order.       



      Bricks are red-skinned, but life is black.
      The completed world begins at the window.
      We write and we talk, but who can remember
      A style as high as a spire, its golden endpoint?









   

 The one who's leg is broken
by falling off some
shelf.

      She dresses her doll in gray
ginghams
& ribbons bounded
into beau ties

  And her English becomes more
hidden with meanings
  So that her intelligience is judged by the man she sleeps with

  A kind and gentle man with manly traits.
I suppose with a somewhat cute
manner

  So, she returns to her old habitual way
TV, radio, computer & keyboard.
It becomes her soul lover
a transmortification
  Always interpreting the audience's
Reaction
  Being impartial of their 
total participation.       



      I do the best I can and the:
misconceptions
mis communications and
mis interpretations
      Has nothing to do with what I did
today,
as long as the philosophy
has not caused any  departures from death

      My blue jeans are in tatters and
I want to get to the next foreign
country,
stay there for a while
and just look over the
horizon.

      I just want to wander the world
like my Dad did
and be a merchant mariner.
Seaward Ho!

      All the daughters of family associations
are vying for power.
and all it is
is another
stupid game
so
turn on the computer
and indulge some free moments;

      Before the house gets cleaned,


 



 


 
The claw crackers, small thin forks, knuckle
the passing
of equipment back and forth
from the table head (our hostess)
then back and around
like roulette, misses and near misses
a pas de deux, the sound, and the fish smell;
the squirts bull's-eye your neighbor. 

Our
rigging and tackle, our bibs,
strike and crash
the fun is nonstop (the horsing around)
high low, draw poker, penny ante, or...
  while shuffling toward the sword dancer
heel to toe, bluffing as we make the rounds. 

Dedicating
this to you is like cheating,
the naming and listing of games
your dance card full, your chip cup too.


Please tell me the name of your favorite river.
Running water over our hands, squeezing
lemon to remove the smell--
  the color of roe your smile
devious as you hide the ace of spades
(no, the jack of hearts)
  under the bridge
just a large table
a successful finesse nonetheless. 




      For centuries we seeded the cemeteries.
    So it was no surprise the soil
    grew nothing but headstones.
      Our hands held bleak acres of newsprint,
    black bouquets of tortures and rapes,
      and rapes as the instrument of torture. 
    Now time runs back into the machinery
      of stars, eats itself like words dissolving
      under the steady force of a delete key.
      Now everything dies before it can occur.
    No one laughs for fear of sanctioning
      the sun’s red bowl of hydrogen,
    the incendiary bubble boiling,
      blowing a typhoon of horses
      and white flames, scalding and scarifying,
    until passion’s scarred arteries 
    become the cracked old crockery
      of long-dead riverbeds.
      In the lunar eclipse,
    a murder was committed. 
    The murderer was unaware he was blind,
    his eyes black as blasted lakes.
    He was unaware that each new street
    he walked was a grave.
      Black sledges brought the dead
    across the white wastes.
    A lone voice keened like a lantern.
    The air was full of harsh smoke,
    I placed half dollars on the victim’s
    staring eyes to calm the river’s
    roiling waters, black as oil sludge,
    that the betrayed might cross to peace.
    We disrobed for the last time,
    stepped out of cold skins,
    and became the last light
    disappearing in the river's current.  


 


i have a double life the homeless (sha)man said
  there are 2 of me
i have 2 selves
  i never use them at the same time

i live in double time
i try not to make it a HABIT

N.Y. is my nightmare my dream
  it is what is beneath the tracks
  defiled virgin whore
  maladjusted transexual godess
  cross-eyed cross dresser
  homeless shaman as greasy as the tracks

i am consumed by jealousy he says
  it is my job to carry this burden
so that you do not

N.Y. is skeleton & frame
heaven hell tributes & lies
  the facts as he sees them
  skyline & light
city of fallen angels
extinguished stars

N.Y. is nature mort
landscape & EATS
  jesus buddha & god

N.Y. lives on borrowed digital time
  like shaman
leading a double life
  the good the bad &
the epi-centre
  outside the centre outside time
  a part of & apart from america
  what is beneath the tracks
  shaman living on outside time

N.Y. is 2 selves
  never the same thing twice
  never living together
as to not use each other up
  body soul
ripped greasy ugly love

N.Y. is what is beneath the self the self the other self.....


 








 Deep in the underwater cave
A drunken submarine lies low
A dream angel swimming in the blue-light
A scuba-ninja with rubbery wings
Smuggles another Russian hit man
Against the wrath of the dark sea 
To the far away Rockaway of the soul 
To the Far Rockaway of the “gold rush” 
To the place of lost and found things 
In the jagged dunes, fishermen and fishing poles
An old sailor with a hangover sings a sad ballad, 
Backwards in time and space, staring at the stars
Here at the edge of the unending continent
Far East Rockaway, very far away
And the mafia song of a don is wailing
As if an angel holds a gun to his white head 
At the gates of Paradise, Saint Solonik stops him
Distorted history falsely recorded for arms merchants
Selective amnesia for super killers 
Distressed grannies trying to commit suicide
Questioning why they ever came to America
In St. Petersburg shadows make the walls cry
Till they fade in the night,
Skulls are breeding
Russian Mafia raising its ugly face
Armies of drowned dogs and blind-sailors 
Rain falls on the subway tracks,
While trains are rushing 
From Far Rockaway of The Body and Mind
To the “lower insider” of “Bratva” in Loisaida.








 



 





With cold wind slipping from brisk
  waters of the Elwha River,
  coiling around me –

frosted topped waves
  cresting cloudy teal
  en route from the glacier peaks – 

 steep valley tributaries


bringing down
          sediments of gabbro and granite,
          stirring them to a brew of
          stone soup in the bottom rapids 

I sat on a dark boulder
  just above the tonguing waters
  scooping drink 

This fleck of Earth,
  seemingly settled with its ancient Douglas Firs –
giant skewers, gaunt in the failing light,
  among mountains, sharp to the inch 

Underneath,
  where the world is so hot
  it is orange with elasticity,
  and rising with pressure,

bright tendrils extend
          from bulbous magma plutons
          and swell into the cracks
          of rock shelving.  There,
          the plates grind, fixing into the earth – crust puzzle 

On a dark boulder,
  the shift of the world,
  no me.


You are here in the blood
At the bottom of the cup
Of the yellow hibiscus
In the Apapane fire cutting through sugarcane
Rain that sweeps each morning down the west Maui mountains
You’re the proud look of my teenage son
Sweetness of his younger brother
Even    (God help me)    in the line of warmth
Along the sleeping body of my wife      



    I fumble stacks of coins into the slot
    Our conversation cracks
  Faulted with my guilt    your resentment      



    I sleep    wake    the window is open to the surf
You break over me in waves
    


 




 In kindergarten
our elders 

Teach
us to memorize by heart

 Each
sugarcoated letter 

In the
ABC of lies

 Because
the aspirin of fact 

Is
a tough
act to swallow. 

Then
we slowly learn 

To shape
letters into 

Plain
words of untruth.

 Afterwards,
we graduate 

To the
art of stringing 

Beads
of pearly words 

Into
lustrous sentences, 

A necklace
of deception. 

Finally
we ourselves become 

Masters
of prevarication 

And fabricate
sentences 

Into
flawless paragraphs 

Of falsehood
which we print 

Into
a hardbound handbook 

Of light
and circulate 

To the
coming generation 

While
the primer of truth 

Gathers
dust and cobwebs 

In some
dark, stuffy corner 

Of the
inarticulate.


  

 Her
tangerine lips and everything so full,
  Mexican eyes like coals burning from obscure to gray,
said she was Italian and Spanish
but Donna Chavez was pura Chicana,
such were the times and I
loved her gleaming tangier lips and the
sway of her body as we danced.
Teasing me, you move pretty good for a white boy,
we left and snuck silently under the watchful kitchen window,
into my room and touched each other lightly, slowly,
my mouth stripping her face of apricot, devouring the essence
for so long, and it was enough until she said,
you don't have to be shy,
and I was too young to know, to not be hurt so
my body worked to a fury of sweat and screams to prove I wasn't.
As morning arrived my pillow
  gleamed with bright zinc orange streaks of lip gloss,
  like the blinding mean wave of the sun,
or a Pollack oil flailing in lines
never understood, but glorious
like seventeen year old Mexican girls
in Los Angeles in 1982 who liked
white boys and were never allowed to be Mexican.
Silently watched her naked pale mouth
quiver in dreams, like an apple dissected, smothered in honey,
fading into browning slices, but still perfect,
with eyes closed, or merely
letting go. Kissing her forehead
as she stirred, wondering what else
would soon be revealed as faded.

No definitive
reason to take the cross-town bus on the coldest day of the year,
but I stood there,
on Mass Ave., a long time, alone.
Suddenly
the wind flung a pair of lace panties sauntering clear across the road.
A dance, a swagger,
virgin's, prostitute's? Behind
me on the Christian Science Building two carved words stared down from
the cornice: PURITY - MERCY. The
color of the underthings somewhere between pink & purple. 

The next
day on the boat above the pink-blue sea I saw newlyweds: she
sat writing thank-you notes, left-handed, diamond & white gold bright.
He sat mute with the
curve of back I've seen only torn by ancient sculptors out of marble.




 

In the
middle of the night the diesel-fuel-blue sound of the train collided with
the brilliance of the moon. She
knelt up on the bed to close the storm window. Then
the dream, The Private Viewing Parlor of Kazakstan, could begin
in peace. She
told me that some of the participants in the room merely embraced. Others,
she revealed shyly turning in underpants & pantyhose as she dressed for
work, did more. We
figured most of it was triggered by the Paris sex shop scenes Kieslowski
used for backdrop
in the first of his tri-color films, Blue, which we saw earlier
that night. 

Since
the self-titled dream called itself "Private," I didn't hound her for
details. The
young woman who performed on stage in the film, wasn't she afraid her
father was in the audience? Didn't
she tell Juliette Binoche he glanced at his watch in order to catch the
last train to Montpellier? Wouldn't
my wife, whose own father died when she was three, want him to join her
anywhere, even in the viewing parlor? (In French, so to
speak?) She
steps bravely into the blue Monday of work, her unresolved longing, naked,
played out on the big, blue screen of grief. 





Bloated bellies, shoeless feet, 

dusty streets and mildew,

the thick sweet smell of rotting plants, 

small watt bulbs that flicker, 

and everywhere the wail and fear 

of voodoo's living dead --

surely not the stuff of joy -- 

yet joy is what the young priest claimed 

abounds in Plaissance, Haiti.

 

Was Haiti not the cruel place, 

where grand cru wines and strong dark rum, 

French cuisine and kinky sex 

were plentiful and cheap; 

where a few bucks ended

a wretched life, and cast 

a junior Consular 'to the netherworld 

of money, drugs and power, 

forty years ago in Port-au-Prince?

 

Hand-by-hand 

the felt-lined basket passes to my lap. 

There, 

under the young priest's patient, prayerful eyes, 

slowly,

I empty my wallet 

for the joy in Plaissance, Haiti. 

 






 I'm 16 and skating
  around and around the ring,
  trying to make sense of how
  life's treated me so far.

In the center, doing lopsided spins,
  I'm like the dog circling and circling nose to tail,
  trampling reality to make his bed of comfort
  dizzying the world to a blur
  before it can shake me apart.

Suddenly ELO's "Livin' Thing" comes on over the loudspeakers
  and it all clicks. I head out to the far edge,
hugging the wall for maximum speed
  the gypsy violins squeezing out my hurt
  and replacing it with adrenaline.

The ice is forgiving.
  It cradles my blades.
  My stride is sure
  from hip to toes.        

Session's ending. The vapid cha-cha version of
  "What Now My Love" blasts
  behind the announcer's voice.
  As the ice empties I sneak one last victory lap
  as if my life depended on it
  and for now, it does. 


First was the face of the friendly driver at the Leonardo da Vinci airport
  The fake smile of the porter when I tipped him with US dollars
  The unsophisticated faces of the visitors at the Galleria Villa Borghese
  The face of Franco Trevisi and the chase on foot to the Trevi Fountain
  The face of the owner of La Piccolo Aranha when we sent the wine back
  He returned with another bottle and a bowl of strawberries
  All this and more was immortalized in writings, on photos and videos
  Interlaced Roman profiles, Mediterranean eyes staring, grimacing
  The desperate faces of Asian women selling scarves in Piazza Navona
  The perverse smiles of the people who sent us in the wrong direction
  The guard’s angry visage when I photographed the paintings at Uffizi gallery
  The confused mug of the guide at the Coliseum when asked: “What is a `camelopard?’”
  At Fico bar the excited appearance of Sandro Dernini, the art impresario
  The impatient faces of artists and writers when Massimo prepares risotto
  The grave facial expression of City Officials at a St. Catherine Parade in Siena
  Transplaced pilgrimage to retrace Dante’s face and his steps in exile
  Embracing the Mediterranean spaces, Tuscan places and Etruscan graces
  To the towers of Purgatory! My fellow travelers!  Heads up!
  A vertical horse race on the narrow staircase, from the top to the base
  The long faces of marching soldiers when I told them not to go back to Iraq
  The unfazed face of the old jogger when I asked for Santa Croce in Florence
  The annoyed facial contortion of the old waiter when asked if he knew Marrinetti
  The Florentine face of the woman who compared herself to the painting of Botticelli
  The wise disguise of the Jews in the Venice ghetto and in Florence’s synagogue
  The distorted faces of Catholic Priests, nuns and worshipers at Mass in Como
  The defaced, on purpose, Marilyn Monroe image that sold for big bucks
  The radiant faces of Stash, Katherina and their son Micha in Bellagio and Lecco
  The confused faces of Elena and Gianpaulo driving from Milano to Picasso
  The Fellini-like expression of the count Federico Sangiardi Quinto Di Wardal
  His blue-blood family tree “growing” since Egyptian times in Alexandria
  These were the faces of Italy, the faces reminiscent of Dante’s Divine Comedy
  The faces of Kings, heroes and nobles, of poets, artists, concubines and dancers
  Recalling the faces and places, difficult to describe and even harder to forget.

 

 



 
 
Fear and shame, you are the checkpoint
  of the soul where all that shines
is rifle-butted
back into
  this land of frozen smiles,
  where I am never listening
  to a woman as she moans
  about her day, shyly bowing
my head, making her laugh
and wetly kissing her in the summer
of her lips, my bones are now
  a Bering beach, where I linger, snow pile
the sun cannot quite reach 

 



 


1
Nazi thinkers claimed his blessing, but Herr Nietzsche's life was clean.
Walter Kaufmann spied injustice—such a cause for strife was clean.
    

2
  Nietzsche's war years saw no fighting—his flawed eyes were far too weak.
  He attended wounds from gunshots; he made sure the knife was clean.

3
  Dionysus met Apollo in Die Geburt der Tragödie.
—the aesthetic words were soiled, while the lure of fife was clean.

4
  Europe needs its brightest thinkers—no one race builds ancient Greece.
Der Übermensch was not a Hitler; latent strength so rife was clean.

5
  Friedrich's school days saw no wenching, still his life proved short and sweet 
—his syphilis was his parents', being void of wife was clean. 

 


face
down upon
wet leaves where
  no more shall fall
i'd forgotten this moment
when trees cease their applause
upon the stage
my father returns to
avert the final curtain–
  its drop, heavy,
white & fleece
weighing down upon his arms
as impending age settles in
our eyes, lapsing to dilations
like stones skimming a pond,
absorbed by blinking crescents
where shadows seep, then
hemorrhage out
through the teeth of life's terminal gate
here, we've wrestled with death's claws
whose gnarled thumbs gouge through
our petrified, leaden hearts,
then leave us to wander
blind, deaf
and mute after
the last rustle of spring 



 

 


And the
quiet shrinks into my breast
  Like dead fish.
Fulton Street is alive catering these deaths–
  I hear their mangled suffocations
Between wailing car alarms at 2AM
Mourning the previous day's losses
The East River has developed
Sleep apnea. It tosses out its dark dreams.
I reach out, arms tight with want.
A cold glass fills with blood on Water
Street, stones and knives
Along the contemplative bridge
A helicopter chops sky:
To
drink a city 
To
chew a river 
To
smash my epitaph open 
Where
my mother aborts me again
  Humming through
A requiem of melted snow
Arsenic is in season
  Freezing notes in our hearts.



 

 
15 April 1992
I stayed home
  all day.
Friends came,
friends went.
Afterwards
  I there was a storm.
In
  Lhassa, Tibet, a blind lama died. 

16 APRIL 1992
I stayed home
  all day.
No one came.
The body of
  the Tibetan lama was moved to a hill.
A few dozen
  eagles gathered
from among
  all the starving eagles of India, of Asia,
and began
  pecking at the sacred corpse. 

17 APRIL 1992
stayed home
  all day, again.
I read an
  encyclopedia.
All I had
  read I forgot at once.
Only the Tibetan
  lama's bare bones were left.
Empty nirvana,
  indeed ! 

18 APRIL 1992
I stayed home
  all day, again.
Lo and behold,
the dead lama
  had left a son, born in secret.
In deepest
  night, he collected the lama's remains.
After sunrise,
  he made two necklaces with the bones.
One he kept.
The other
  he decided to sell to American poet Allen Ginsberg.
So now nirvana
  links Lhassa and New York !


The kids have been
  playing boisterously in the yard,
    even kids from the neighboring village.
    Somehow the dogs didn't bark, just wagged their tails.
    But the whole village has been playing noisily,
    even the banished chicks and hens.
    It was no place for adults
    with their coughs of alarm.
    Hopscotch, shuttlecock-kicking, scissors-paper-stone,
    to say nothing of running to the spring,
    winning, losing, time knowing no end.
    No need for mother, in her wet apron,
    to keep coming and going to see if they're alright.
    The noisy play is fine, so very fine.
    No trace of any other world at all.
    Why should tomorrow or the day after ever come?
    The children, there were ten or twenty of them,
    the whole country is full of kids like these.
    Then the Beggar's Star shone early in the sky,
    After twilight, came night.
    It became hard to recognize each other's faces
    and one by one they set off homewards.
    Thank heaven children have names!
    "Illyong-a, Samryong-a, Kuryong-a, Mansop-a! "
    Especially, that children have names in the dark.
    Behind them, the chicks flap up to their perches
    in the coop, defying hunger; just before,
    they were pecking hungrily at one another.
    In the empty yard, where have the noisy games all gone?
    Over the not-so-very-lofty mountain,
    other stars rise, freely following
    the Beggars' Star, announcing their presence
    by little light they can muster.
    How could the world beyond not be down here?
    All night long the wind sleeps, dew falls,
    while the other world comes, plays, then goes.
    When the first cock crows at early dawn
    the others follow suit, from house to house.
    Now is the time for blind folks to gaze off into the distance.
    In their sleep, the children are still kicking off the blankets,
    growing up to be sleepy-heads just like their fathers.

 

 

 Sunset
drops in faraway the earth
Sad singing voice of gone friends
When disappear through wheat field
Along evening sun that burn ruddily
Quiet yearning stays Saddled man's solitude shines
That wait for morning of alien land
Graze in girl's shallow smile lamella
That pass to wave beyond of paned sorrow
Along lullaby of echo Waving petals
Dim recollection which dwell in dew
Season of love
That shine on eye rims that wet as is slightly wet
Solitude of an young day
That is outspread boundlessly
Disappear silently following legend of the fall 



 

    To the Man who created phys. ed.:
    I salute you.  With one hand angled
  symmetrically to the head, and one
  behind my back—fingers crossed. 
  I loathe you, and not just for flag football
  or the early feminist treatments of boy
  versus girl kickball, in the gym on those rain-
    soaked days that seemed to inch by
  as slowly as math class.  But for 9:25 a.m.,
  when Coach Rachin, our stubby coach
  with a Napoleon complex, blew emphatically
  into his whistle, signaled us
  to place our basketballs away
  in the cage, and then he’d utter words
  still threaded deep into my mind,
  a single line, more resonant than Social Studies
  taped speeches of JFK or MLK Jr.—
Hit the showers.  For me it was a daunting
  thirty-yard stagger to the boys’ locker room,
  like the long march to the principal’s office.
    I prayed god would intervene
  in the form of an attendance office note
  or falling light fixture or even earthquakes—
    we never had an earthquake my three years
  in middle school.  Instead, I ambled
    into a purgatory of lost and sweaty socks,
    praying I didn’t have to change
  in front of anyone.  As the other boys
  packed into the locker room,
    some wrapped in thin gym towels,
  some prancing naked—I thought
  of their mom’s whispering to themselves: 
I really wanted a girl.  I watched as the procession
  filed into the all-tile shower, an open room
  that held twenty boys at a time.  And as I stood
  in my swim trunks, about to enter
  this shower—the tile and flailing
    of precious bodies wrapped in a cloud
  of confusion and heavy steam,
  fear and mist— my thoughts were haunted
  to History class and the photographs
  of the gas chambers at Auschwitz.







Down silicate dunes, across impossible dreams
  of black glass and red clay, the horsemen rode--
  seven, implacable, aloof, commanding.
  Their horses' hooves, ringed in steel,
  rang clean on stone, sang of missed days
  and forsaken nights, of the broken chances
  that always spell a desolation of wants.
  The night's hair was braided with weeping.
  The day's winding cloth was woven of weeping.

Factories spilled their workers' preserved hearts,
  their pickled spirits, into the green maw
  of determined and interminable desire.
  Smokestacks choked the sleek wind,
  wrapped their wire scarves round its slim neck
  and squeezed till the air was still as desert rock,
  till storm sewers thrust up a torrent of dead dogs.
Weeping filled the air with the cold taste of remorse.
  Weeping filled the air with the smoke of unseen fires. 

The horsemen rode into a mountain village.
  The air was thin and the horses were breathing hard.
  The men dismounted and drank cups full of spiders
  and delicate webs from the abandoned well.
  Their horses slurped scorpions from a dry trough.
  The men eyed the sun hung at the meridian,
  a desiccated bread crust, a rough quartz icon.
  This morning only mourning doves sang, weeping.
  This evening only bats and owls prayed, weeping.

Orphans trailed through the immolated streets.
  Beggars collapsed into dust and rotted teeth.
  All the houses were littered with dying mice.
  The houseflies wriggled their eyelash-thin feet
  in slow but resolute death.
  Yet empty clothes still got up and went to work,
  and empty clothes still put their checks in the bank.
  Weeping filled the plates with coal grit and ash.
  Weeping filled the pantry with steel filings and sand.

The horsemen could not make their horses stand up.
    They sent their last bullets through the windows
    of the horses' skulls, watched them bleed ball bearings
    and toothless gear wheels and miles of rust.
    There was no shade so the horsemen collapsed
    against a compound's fence, topped with razor wire.
    As sun flamed to earth, they gagged on their tongues.
    Nothing was heard for a long time, not even weeping.
    Nothing was heard for a long time, not even weeping.

 





one, push.

she says 
to my mind you are a pedestrian
in a pale gray coat who, smoking on his way 
to the shop for cigarettes crosses 
paths with the wall window ahead 
of the table at which i am sitting
and she thinks it is elegant this image
he says
i am buying a new brown suit
something between american cut and european—
he has never been to europe never seen chaucer's 
plain slab grave in westminster abbey 
or the cautious motion of the february river liffey  
in truth he knows nothing of caution
whatever that is, nothing of old english 
or that ash to her 
means a letter, not dust—side slit three buttons
he says 
buttons like he is unhooking the letters
she says yes a pale gray coat 
she is fixed on his buttons
the eye hooks
he says 
what kind of coat? i was thinking something
between american and european
she says no i
i was thinking something
i was thinking something about a man
in front of a window who stops—she stops 
—and tips his hat to me
who has your face
but who speaks like William Langland must have
he says
who is William Langland? what kind 
of suits did he wear?  she says
in my mind he did not wear suits
he reclined naked with his wife under an oak 
tree uncapping acorns which he
placed like hats on her nipples
and every now and again when his wife 
heard the sound of the lark
she would tip her hats to him 
and they would hold each other and afterwards 
he would go on uncapping   

two: anchor 

    as they drove she saw a doe on the side of the road.  no motion, only the crane
    and thrash of its neck in the air, a pocket of last energy. ductile doe, struck a minute
  before their approach.  a minute away from stillness.  he was late for an interview. 
  he did not stop, even through the lights.  she said the czech have a word
for this. they call it trapit, when you let a being suffer. before his interview he kissed her 
between her neck and shoulder, on flesh that corresponded to that of the wounded
deer.  she said, the czech have a word for this. he kissed her mouth—it was their first 
kiss — he said do they have a word for this?


three.  pull.

outside, a squirrel falls from a telephone wire. it begins that way. 
  he says, a squirrel that cannot hold on. she says,

    it is snowing.  you see what i mean? later, over coffee, they listen
  to two russian women, speaking partners, who articulate so deliberately, so as to carve 

    every word. they are remarkable in their beauty, the women.
  in the direction of these women he says as it were, which she mistakes for rapture. 

    one of the russian women perches herself on his lap, placing his hat
  on her head, tipping it to her russian friend in acknowledgment. and they are lost

    in each other now, he and the russian mistress.  there is an energy about loss, she says,
    remembering the doe, chaucer, the synchronized egress of the said and the unsaid.  

    there is an energy and a non-energy, the same way one might reach for a bar of soap
  in the bath and, as it slips, huddle motionless in the water. perhaps the energy is
  trapped 

by the non-energy, she wants him to say, but it is not on his
  tongue.  and what is on his
  tongue, she wants to know.  a gaggle of affection?  a waspy lust?  the taste of oak?—

    what does that taste like, anyway?—the energy of loss? he says. do you mean the loss
  of energy?  no, she says, the creases of a letter discarded, the tarnish of a hinge.  he
  smiles at the russian 

    mistress. she says hatless acorns.  she holds his hand across the table, places his hand
    on her chest. she says, see what i mean



  After the bleak first winter in Brooklyn 
Exiled from Manhattan 
in the backyard of my row-house, 
the size of a tiny Village studio 
dogwood blooms 
like an overnight sensation 
a profusion of intense satin pink 
coy and bold, modest and dazzling 
like a young geisha 
in a ravishing kimono 

Late this year, says my neighbor 
who has seen it bloom for seventeen springs 
A tinge of envy in his melancholy voice 
he has crocuses and daffodils 
and tulips from Brooklyn Botanic Garden 
Already bloomed and withered  
As I covet a neighbor's magnolia, 
He must covet my dogwood 

I do not tell him 
about the fiery glow it casts on my wooden floor 
nor about the elation I feel 
when I dip my bare feet as though it was a river 
when I have my morning coffee 
watching birds whose names I do not know
come and sing with frivolous generosity 
and flit away with indifference and such levity   

Instead 
I gaze up at the haughty glory in the thin morning sunlight 
all blooms, leafless yet  
A disquieting, erotic and despairing perfection 

Unable to write 
I rearrange the books yet again 
and rehang the pictures on the wall 
and walk to The Narrows bay  
with a book: 
La Dame Aux Camelias by Dumas fils    
deserted streets of spring trees   
babysitters' chatter in Spanish in someone's backyard  
a meringue playing on a radio 
laughter and shouts of their young charges 
The only people I pass 
a Muslim woman and her twin girls 
lovely in skinny yellow pants and gray blouses 
brown-eyed, and in iris-blue head scarves 
the girls skip along to the rhythm of an exotic song in their heads 

From the 69th Street pier, 
where Mexican men in baseball caps fish 
practicing the Zen of waiting 
I could almost reach out  
across the wide rippling body of water 
and touch Manhattan 
the silvery, floating island of bottomless desire 
once I so feared to leave 
On whose shore I buried all regrets and envy 
when I left  
for whom I pine a little less each day  

After the last round of the Mister Softee ice-cream truck    
over treetops and rooftops with black-tarred chimneys   
the sky mimics a Florentine sky in Renaissance paintings    
a baby blue canvas feathered with soft orange clouds    
One by one, then, neighbors return    
to the street of United Nations:   
a Turk, a Chinese, an Irish, a Pole, a Russian, and an Italian    
the misty street with elongated shadows   
shot through with the last rays of the sun   
shared with alley cats, an occasional possum and a raccoon    

At night in bed   
with windows open to the backyard  
where the dogwood tree  
keeps to itself  
its desire a muted flame  
I listen  
to the foghorns from the bay  
the indiscreet, fat and mournful sounds  
a trumpet played in low keys   
Alone and still lost  
but not lonely    


Over a fortnight or so into May  
The dogwood petals fade a little each day  
bruised by night mists  
bleached by the spring sun    


Books I read pile up on the desk  
Celine, Auden, Dickens, Woolf and Turgenev  
long turned to dust  
And I remain yet uninspired   

One morning a cold spring rain comes  
to douse the last flame of the dogwood  
All afternoon I watch  
the papery petals fall and scatter   
in a lazy drift of wet confetti    

Sweeping the million soggy petals     
my paralyzed and frozen mind thaws a little  
a tiny stir of excitement and anticipation  
maybe I will be able to write again  
more than five years after 9/11   
when for a moment I thought it might be my last day   
Crawling blindly  
through the warm gray dust of the pulverized tower  
that fell thickly blotting out the sun   

The memory and terror of the day  
still haunts and invades my dreams  
But I now possess the joy I never knew before  
And at last some semblance of peace  
in my first spring in Brooklyn    
a modest paradise of the exiled  


 




Even
before they could enter them
Like an irreversible dream,
Even before the invisible birds
Could turn the giant silver towers

Into
a shimmering mirage in the desert,
Could fall like giant metal tears
From an impossibly blue early morning sky,
And the concrete dust 

Could
bulge through the streets
  Like clouds of sand
In a new more terrible kind of desert,
A new more terrible kind of reality. 

The rooster
from the Wild West
Was already strutting on the world stage,
His dull feathers and even duller beak
Filled with retribution, evil doers, and "those folks"-

One wing
taking cover in the Midwest,
In the name of greater security,
  And the other launching a New Crusade
In behalf of the old Belt and Book-

And the
hen was hiding in his cave in the East,
Laying comfortably back on his well-manicured elbow,
Dictating into his microphone a 'holy' war, a new, still more Fundamental
moral imperative, this one from the Mideast-

Even
before the angels could finish falling
From the steel blue sky like birds on fire.
Now terrified by the external world
All of its internal struggles become outer ones;

And comparably
terrified
  By the inner ones, the exterior world
Becomes a stealthy black one.
Now we can all dance

A new
oily black Dance of Death
In the desert - the first but surely not the last
In the new millennium - in the monstrous name
Of freedom with a green back 

And a
god with a veiled face.
And we dance this dance
Even before the angels can finish falling
From the steel blue sky like birds on fire. 

 

 

 There
what will I find of you,
Expect to, your words like ice
Forming on a branch, the soul thawing 
In the moon's splayed thigh,


A
bridge like a lapsed heart, 
Snow the color of empty
sheets at dawn,
A river turning into a lost lover, 
And in the garden the sadness
of the open gate? 

And
what will I bring to you, after the gods, 
Can I, the memory of youth's
flower
Breaking at twilight, placed everywhere 
Like ashes upon a golden
threshold?


   
 

 

 

Al mara*
Like any woman I know
  Beats down the twitch
  Under her skin
  Tucks the frayed fibers
  Of her social mask
  Re-makes herself whole
  Into this world
  And begins to maul
  Her shroud of tender skin
  In order to “arrive”

  Her father sends her back
  Instructing her that the
  The difference between
Mara and girl is marriage
  So she shrugs with disdain
  Conceding to be a girl

  She wears a woolen gown to kill the winter and
  Imagining that its threads twist and spiral
  Into the earth,
  She stands upright
  Against the planting post
  And supports the sky
  Her head proof of all the world’s
  Boundaries

*The woman




My mother once painted over
    The furrow in my brow
With the blood
   Of a newly slaughtered sheep
    For a blessing of good health
    I never honored
   Not because I want to be sick
   But because I’m the type to like 
 The smell of my period
Better

The omen of blooming health
  I trade for a sniff
   Heady and solemn when
    I rock back with it like a
    Filled glass

   An intoxicant
   A logic heating
  A little space around me
 
An oven raising
   Its broken-shelled
Smear of smell
    Replacing a thousand blessings of good health
 I have not received 
Since I stood in front
  Of the slaughtered sheep



If you had eyes for me,
  I’d tempt a cup uplifted from a basin
  And give up my hands clean of
  Lifelines divined in small trousseaus

I play-act the streets for youSwagger with a bottle and
Slur, I’m a tirade now
I’m brave against my own eyes
And no more, “Give me my ‘proper’
Sometimes.”

 Then tonight / I saw myself years from nowA chronicle in phase one of your life
Falling carelesslyFrom the roof of your mouth
A woman in debt of sense enough to rollIn the dirt with another storyteller
A man drawing up a comical figureWashing herself and
Still clutching their towels that readHers and Mine.

 


At first, she only arrives
Cribbed from the memory
Of six brothers and sisters
   Which she tended, often
    With the slap of her plastic slippers
   Against their backsides

    The family said that my cousin is so white
    She is marriageable
    And carries bills in her pockets
    Even though she is not allowed
    To the gate of her house

    Up to her wedding day
    The white marble of her
    Skin remains pristine
    She is wordlessly taken to another house
    She calls her mother on the phone, crying
  The water has been turned off
    The garden spigot won’t even budge
    For her to wash the heavy bride makeup off her face
    She calls it omen, a marriage destined to drain her
    Hangs up on her mother
    Little else is known

    Yet now I often see her in my garden
    Continents away
    Walking toward me
    Like she never could on her father’s land
    I snap an aloe leaf in two
    And salve her browned leathery face
    Her salt-cracked mouth
    And watch her count her bills
    Before she crosses the garden into the street
    Me, waving
    Her, never looking back



Maybe
immortality will come calling on East 13th Street
And feel the
void left behind in the big loft
Maybe the bold flag-bearers for the beats
Will march tonight throughout Tibet
Maybe the Dalai Lama will proclaim your spirit as a Divine Entity Lion
of Dharma
How come you came to die so soon?
Love dies, body dies, flowers die
But the anarchistic spirit keeps growing
Last drink, last phone call, last joint
Last poem, last new moon like a withered white rose
The circle has closed
Now we are the flag-bearers with long hair for the hippie generation The
voice of the beatniks, of generations possessed
Now is the time for the post-beats, the freedom-obsessed
E=mc2 at 2:00 A.M., April 5, 1997
The hour of our discontent
The portals of heaven are opened by Buddha
It's hard to amend your untimely death, your brave song's end
The monks are chanting, led by Rimpoche
Aum Mane Padhme Aum
We read together at Chinese Chance, at St. Marks Church, at TNC And finally
at Huncke's memorial
Allen Ginsberg, you asked my friend, what is his name again? Pointing
towards me
Too late now,
My name is sitting Shiva, in sitting meditation
For the lion of the freedom
For the lion of New York 

 

I


      Sleepless sorrow. A dark swarm of visions.
      I have read the list of deadmen halfway through
      And I saw death: with a savage scythe,
      It was mowing down life in the middle of a plain.


      Not one flower on this field, not one bee.
      Only cinders and thistles.
      What am I to do with poor Ossian?
      How can I get some kind of answer?

Yesterday’s earth: death in your eye sockets,
      Black conscription, bottomless tombs.
      And the heart whines as never before
    And rings, like a bell that has cracked into pieces.


        II


        Sometimes snow leans on the left foot
        And sometimes it leans on the right:
        For a poet who has lost his freedom
        This actually means very little.


        Was it not he that leaned down to the impoverished
        Soil, and did not the soil take his measure
        For a nameless page, for a thousand
        Snow-white lilac blossoms overhead, falling? 




 



 


*

My arm
and the night
half around–this star
carried downstream

 lets
me rinse its light
beside those great rivers
the lame once every year

crawl
childlike, led–this star
still points and all the world
morning at last. I don't know when.

Every
stream is waiting
till another will flow from its side 

slightly
open, afraid to speak
holding my hand and its shadow

not yet
trampled by moss, by darkness
by sunken eddies and warts–my hand
blurred, limping to the riverside

–all
night though my bones don't soften
twisting even tighter–I never let on
the morning must know I'm here.



Leaving this would be easier
      if only the moonlight seemed
      false, the stars less real or true
    love less tangible as it is

    I will consider a life in some anonymous
    city, artificial and dreamlike,
    standing on a corner without a dime,
    fitting in with all the heartbroken

    dimeless others searching for solace
    in obscurity amid the lonely and the nameless.
    I’d go there to scatter these invisible ashes
    we buried in some forgotten place

    inside your heart. Still at 4 a.m. beneath
    these pulsing stars I cannot sleep,
    heart racing to follow or to stay or maybe just
    to find the final place of rest, beating

    with the stars and very much alone.
    I watch Orion chase his only desire
    until he falls from the face of the earth
    into another night, another's tormented

    darkness no closer to love. He persuades
    her no more than I persuade you, and again
    tonight my chest burns and aches embracing
    the persistence of this desire, one small star

    of seven even the giant with his glittering
    sword cannot touch. The best writers have said little
    so little solace in words. What more could I hope
    to do, how do I master this desire to go

    quietly into sleep when the day shuts down
    and stars come alive like neon in some
    fogbound city where the relevance of words
    weighs less than a cup of coffee,

    where a sad gray bird on the sidewalk
    offers a sweeter prayer than the priest,
    where lives disappear when no one calls,
    where the world is a dark room.




 


Windows whited, pinkybrown squat
Of the old Vincentians squares out 
To cricket field and March hedges. 

Sleepy city awaits its summer dreams, 


Distant car radio sums up the news 
To harveynorman and football scorelines. 
Somewhere someone dies suddenly, 
Colors of a life escape like quarkthings. 
Guess we've no Noah's ark to wait for us. 




If
you live a lie long

enough,
it will bear fruit 

and become
our own life, 

you'll
trail along the way 

 a cross
to be nailed on 

or a
hidden love life

will
grow into timber

for the
tree to hand from 

or the
beam holding up

the roof
over your lie. 

In the
end it matters

not much,
if you have taught 

your
body to resound 

forgiveness
and to transcend.

 

 


  While the talker talks
  you listen – the slight tilt
of your head
upon that pale

 stalk
of neck suggests
Goodness. Your eyes blink

 to
punctuate
  fine taste, that old 

code
of Lady. Trapped
by
the monologist, 

you
do not
protest–the civilized 

lie
protects you from
  what you want: that

 cigarette,
that
  highball, that

 bulge

  in black, pleated trousers

 across
the room.
Your crossed legs slowly 

cross
again, knees together, gingerly
shifting your hips as if 

fragile

  or dangerous. 



 

 

This city is an onerous lover
  Prone to drunken fits of homicidal rage
  This night a holocaust of transparency
  Disappearing into the alley’s wide open mouth
  Secret societies of the heart’s obsessions


    Plot treacherous love scenarios involving rib cages
    Hail, ballad of street discourse
    Night is singing me a sinister song
    Glossy muses wander in gossamer bird bones
    The whispered conversations of mind revive dead corners
    In which breed the hummingbird secret police
    Lost within the Cheshire carnival of the Port Authority
    Cassandra’s nocturne curse of syringe ambiance
    Lying in anger lays release
    Tongue cut by peccadillo, our streets bleed fluency
    In such a violent language

AirWaterEarthFire
  I see Vishnu in the eyes of passersby
  Bacchus in their lips
  His moon sign heart and mouth navigate as
  I secure the gates of my city
  No one enters and I remain alone

Hail Sodom’s opulent gutter madness
  Reverie to the mad girl moon riot raging
  As Cassandra is silently singing
  Kaleidoscope melting and night’s electric light
  Shifting, it is all unchanged, that is,
  It is all as before      

the postcard reads, my dear, dear Vishnu,
    oh, how I miss you
    this neon weather menaces all
    wholesome feeder mice dance in the halls
    dogs consume the ravaged body of summer
    rainbows shout over the howling echo
    within this place, I have transcended night
    impossibly senseless, inebriated,

And I am still in love with you…

 

 

 

 



Day after day passes
  and we do not lift a hand
  to defend ourselves.
  
  The enemy will storm the high tower?
    We leave a side-door unbolted.


      The enemy will starve us out?:
      We let the wheat rot
    in the few fields we control.


      The enemy will divide us?
      We hate the one we sleep with
      for touching us naked,
      for being like mother and father
      but with no distance,
      while the enemy is just a blur,
      a cricket, a cloud passing
    unless... until...


      Sometimes we imagine buckling on greaves
      or saddling the plumed destrier--
      sometimes the armor is brought before us
      in the order in which it would be girded on
      but no: take it away:
    it would chafe.. it smells of rancid oil...


      So we tell the future
      by haruspicy and bird flight.
      Truly the days have taken wing,
    the great flocks are leaving this kingdom--  


    quail, starling, passerine sparrow,
      even the birds of the open ocean,
      merganser, skua, jaeger, albatross,
      even the most solitary--snowy owls--
      wheeling over us in columns
    just to show us they are departing:


      the tea leaves smudge
      at the bottom of the cup,
    a die rolls under the armoire:


      but we have one prisoner
      whom we torture
    night after night,
    stripping him naked, dressing him  


      in a wimple and chemise,                
    beating him with the pommel,
      reviving him at the last moment
    with heal-all, saxifrage, hyssops--


      sometimes we let a rutting ram
      into his cell, and bind his hands..
    We do not stay to see what happens.


      We allow water to drip on him;
    what could be more kind than water..


      We barrage him with questions:
      who are the enemy?
      Are they ruthless?
      Do they have innumerable legions?
      Where are they deployed?
    Behind which tree?


      We interpret his sighs, his groans.
      Even under the hot iron
      he is absentminded,
    sometimes he blesses us...


      We argue among ourselves:
      a thousand thousand legions? No legions?
      A division? A regiment?
      Bivouacked in the wheat? The barley?
    The topless mountains?


      When he sleeps
      we listen with great longing
      to his sighs, his belches,
      his trembling, and record them all
    in a great leatherbound book--


      but days, days are the great enemy,
      our captive is growing old,
      his eyes are dimming,
    he complains of ringing in the ears,
      stiff joints, amnesia, a feeling
      of no longer being able to suffer--
      torments we played no part in--
    and we tremble: 


      when he dies we will live on
      at the whim of a mote of dust
      whirling in the last shaft of evening.






The clouds drop east to west
  Down these same Maui mountains
  Under them skirts of rain
Across the fields
  A line of dancers
  One dances to me   
Brushes my face
  Drops darken the open pages of my book   
  


  In the movie version
  When he carried her body to the plane
  You were so overcome    you clung and cried against me
  We were the last to leave the theater   
  


  I thank you for every word
  I’ve written these two years

Restless,unable
to sleep
Keys, bars, the guns being racked
Year after year
Endless echoes
of steel kissing steel

Noise

  Constant yelling
Nothing said
Vegetating faces, lost faces
dusted faces

A lifer

  A dreamer
Tomorrow's a dream
Yesterday's a memory
Both a passing of a cloud

How I
long
for the silence of a raindrop
falling gently to earth
  The magnificence of a rose
blooming into its many hues
of color
The brilliance of a rainbow
when it sweetly lights up the sky
after a pounding rainfall 

Picnics
in a rich green meadow
  We saw the beauty in butterflies
We made it our symbol
Tiny grains of sand
One hour glass
A tear that may engender
  a waterfall

The memories

  the dreams
are now
Love is now

There's
no beauty in cell bars

  poem 




  b-92377
  tamal, ca 94974 

  We lock ourselves up
not because
of the bars and
steel that surround us
not because life doesn't bend
to our every whim 

But,
because of the projections
  we place on our worlds
The judgments, the "I can'ts"
The thinking the world owes us a living
The trying to please everyone
  while not pleasing ourselves

By seeking
the beauty on the outside
that is surely within
For prisons are created internally
and are found everywhere

We allow
unreal and unnatural thoughts
to be our walls, our limits
Because of the dam we build to
stop universal love, the light

It's
all within our selves
this paradise you go to of beauty
and love
There's peace, where along with the eagle
you may soar
a place inside that was inspired
from the inner and above
which are one and the same

The world
may not bend
to your every whim
But, it will flow wherever
you want it to go.......... 

THERE'S
BEAUTY IN CELL BARS 








I
watched your soft fudge feet
and fresh dipped cherry toes dangle in the air.
They lisped to me tales of luxury
the earth, wind and fire in your kiss. 

My
love go if you must only leave
your smile to mend my heart
  your kiss on lips to heal my spirit
  your sweet voice to appease my soul. 

Instead
of an oak tree we carved
our names on a sandy beach
A wave washed them gently away
We are still there. 

A
swan cannot forget his wings
once he has flown and danced between clouds
I shall miss you and think of you
even dream of you. 

Your
skin so evenly ripe and our love
like gunpowder explodes in pure ecstasy.



I.
  What is this place
I am
in?
  One foot in darkness
  One foot in light?

What
is this place?
Where dark buzzards circle
morning, noon and night?

 What
is this place
  I am in?
  Where Amtrak trains whistle
  by on unseen tracks
on the other side of the mountains? 

II.

  I sit at the base of the light pole
All around me there are people
on the basketball court
Three Mexican-Americans are doing burpies
  listening to soft rock music on the radio. 

Across
the basketball court
multi-colored Christians come together
to pray to their God. 

While
African-Americans slap
dominoes on the concrete tables
behind me. 

I sit
at the light pole
reading Shakespeare.

how mandarin rinds fell from your hands
  left holding naked fruit

how shameless lips danced the shape
  of each slice of flesh
  wholly stripped of any evidence
  that pith or bitter skin could obscure
  the sweet that lay within

it is impossible to deny that sense of longing
  for the things left unknown because
  we never knew they existed

had no reason to believe
  given the confines of our enlightenment
  that still more distant shores hid beyond
  still more distant seas

where young girls butchered
  rare fruits, watching the sun
  set beyond the Andes
  to where strange young boys
  consumed strange meats

Are you tired? If so, skip to #5. 

#1. Of morning and evening smoke rising in sleepy little towns and pueblos. 

#2. Of chuck wagon cooking fires out on the range. 

#3. Of campfires by the singing trout stream. 

#4. Have jolly picnic fires on the mesa and in the canyon. 

#5. Of the tall yarns around the glowing campfire.

EASY LOBSTER RABBIT:You will need a plate. You will need a saucepan. You will need two cans of Welsh rabbit. You'll need a can opener to open them because you're going to make Easy Lobster Rabbit. So you're going to need one 5- or 6-ounce can of lobster, cubed and drained. You're going to need mushrooms, 3 ounces of sliced broiled mushrooms. You're going to need a small pan with a handle. So you better have thatóthat little pan with the handle. You're going to need a small pan with a handle. You're going to need hot toast points. Okay, let's just recap really quickly, and just move things, really fast, fast as you can. You will need a small plate. You will need rabbit, lobster, mushrooms, white wine, hot toast points. A can opener. Dinner in 45 minutes? It's possible! Delicious? Of course! Mealtime, on time, will be no problem with Easy Rabbit Lobster.

    GA-GA-GAMES. Chess is one of the most DIFFICULT of all games to play. Each of the pieces has its own special way of moving. Another DIFFICULT game is bridge. There are over 50 cards and a good percentage of them have to be held in one hand so that your opponent doesn't see them. An Indian game called Gauntlet is ANOTHER DIFFICULT GAME TO PLAY.

ARE YOU A FAN OF __________?
   
  Are you a fan of religion jokes?
What, pray tell, beats this old chestnut:
 


What was the last thing Jesus said up there on the cross?  He said, "Hey, I can see
  my house from here!" from here!

I remember chenille bedspreads. However, I'm not sure when I found out it was called chenille. Go figure. 



 

Jane Harrison, in her Prolegomena, says that all concentrated attention is prayer.

    To read, then? To be in the middle of the book, when the whole of the second

      half lies ahead, each leaf left to savor, absorb, talk with, examine & reexamine, & 

      if difficult, take strict notes in order to etch the text into our hermetic cortex. A 

    litany, then?




So who’s responsible for the curse & blasphemy of the bombing of the ancient 

      booksellers’ & manuscript dealers’ market on Mutanabi Street in Baghdad on

    Monday? Who rendered pieces of flesh strewn over torn pages erasing words?

    What long-term consequences are there to destruction of tomes by incineration in

    propane extinguished by fire hoses, vanished scrolls resembling Souls of human

  corpses? 


    America, tear yourself away from your cell phones, take a break from the rat race 

    & worship of celebrity! America, tear away your fundamentalist cataracts, & 

    realize that the Tigris River is within walking distance of Mutanabi Street!

  America, tear yourself away from the false seduction of American mass culture 

    as superior to others, & know that the Euphrates is more than a long, flowing line 

    on a grade school map drawn in crayon!        




   



So much of the time, I exaggerate. 

The great is only good. The terrible, 

Downplayed, or dropped from

 

The story altogether. And nothing—

Nothing is said about words exhausted  

At the Sidewalk with Sam and Lois. 

 

But sometimes, a soon-to-be-night sky 

Descants itself into being much more 

Than expected. To hear hope’s angel 

 

Alone is one thing; but to witness

Them singing with you was almost 

Too much: goat-ragged hills, lavender,  

 

Hawks circling oaks, which rip up

To the sun—through whose columns

Finches fluttered, “My sister. My brother.”

 

   




One thought
  not of
  chair’s stance,
  position



in history’s
  climb, or
  seat, just

to plop,
  not arm

  prisoner
  in cell, in

and feces,
  huddled
  raging on

First medicine

This is the one that will make him love me,

She said, holding up the fifth lace skirt,

Her eyes wider, darker in her face

Made of breath, and hair dyed black

To please 

Please, please him, who already loves 

 

Her when she takes off outer longings

And they turn to cats, rolling,

Furry, rowling, all inside the covers

Of each other, pull them off

 

Their heads, their scattered freckles, words.

 

See Through

Under the falling glances

Turning this way to be in one world,

That way to see another,

Each character getting on the train,

Chinese, or speaking loudly to Alone,

Those covered in the dream 

Made of commercial 

Sleight of hand,



Remain that which slides

Between the shifting levels,

Watery, transparent,

Icicles melting 

Too fast to break.

how many times can we use the word i i i i 

enough that we become other other other,

the old mexican man on the train 

who chuckles from time to time

while continually playing his mandolin

with only broken strings 

crammed up together

along its neck in a rambunctious bundle,

as he sits so close to me his smell

becomes me, the boldly dissonant sounds resonate

as everyone looks at him annoyed,

and sees me smiling at the beauty--

Implicated!

Abandoned dock at
  night 

on the thigh of
  the Gualdaquiver. 

The grope of oars
  

bending branches
  of amber light,

 licking, cleaning,
  

the cerulean lens
  of the apparatus. 

 

All I can drink
  of this river 

is anarchy & wind,

 the pure tint of
  spirit

 whistling downstream,

 washing the imagination's
  laundry, 

drenching the turgid.
  

 

 The emotions of
  bashful lovers

 wade at the basin,
  

their hesitant sounds

 sinking into a
  single limb, 

capsizing perpetually
  

their vows of celibacy.
  

 

Sky turns 

from informant to
  secret. 

The truth so far
  away, 

the peace so near.
  

We all must drown
  someplace.

 I'm glad I do here.
  

 

The silver lamé looks good on you
the little black dress fits just right
you'll grow as it grows so,

can I have that black dress?

You are thirty-nine and very surprised
  you told the doctor you had a tumor

but the tumor has two eyes

and you are very surprised.
  How can this be at thirty-nine?

Just like it was when you were twenty-one.
  It was the forties so it wasn't your fault
honeymoon sheets hung on the line
so you stole away to New York
to figure it out yourself.

It was hard so you failed
after drinks at Jack Dempsey's
before breakfast at the Taft
Ella sang two sultry sets
you got her autograph but no information
arrived home sweaty happy blind
little black dress gathering
  in all the wrong places.

 


Christ must have followed
  you an old guy
  into the last standing house
  on Murder Street
  he has heart
  the drug dealer said
  the old guy has heart
  and he placed his hand on your back
  then you turned and took it
  and cuffed it and led him away

every time I hear Sinatra
  see a war movie
  read Ernest Hemmingway
  buy cigarettes
  eat alone with one hand
  covering both eyes
  I remember
  you the old guy
  me your little girl
  the number on the house
  the name of the street
  where we lived

 


I had
a fellowship, but lived poorly
  On slices of pizza.
  Later, a career of washing lettuce;
  but I have always been the same.
  It's a question of acquiring a mastery of tone
  Beneath the crystal chandeliers and champagne
  on a glass table top.
  At the age of five I thought Scarlett O'Hara
  a fictional character. It was not until
  The age of forty-eight I knew she was real.
  Old clothes and bedroom slippers and a scarf
  Wrapped around her head
  In low cost tenement housing.
  She began talking about my writing
  And her sex life.
  I'm curt by nature and dolorous.
  But I knew if I worked hard I'd eventually make it.



 

How many loves had I
  in young boy's bed,
  at Humarock, or Provincetown's
  Cape Cod, under sweating summer sun,

  after Land's End, before their interruption.
  How many loves had I?

  in discourse by firelight, after highballs
  to records of Marlene Dietrich and Cole Porter,
  how many loves had I?



  in Swampscott flat, or Beacon Hill house,
  Beacon Street garage or Fiedler overpass,
  how many loves had I?



  How many loves, in Annandale
  before payment or threat, in the Public Gardens
  or Fifth Avenue park, how many loves--

  None, none, none at all.



 

 

 

 

 

 


Poem For A Friend In Prison



hello
Joe
  I could handle the name change
but they keep transferring you
to so many different units
that I'm running out of space
in my address book
and now they're shuttling you
from prison to prison
I know this is America
but this is a bit too much
even for a pro like me
all these prisons being built
like factory assembly lines
I mean there's only so many
license plates one can make
makes no sense to me
  you ask how I'm doing
  which is kind of you
  given your own circumstances
  I'm confined to my own prison
even if there are no keepers
  where life has become a surreal movie
with nothing but bit actors
like those old sing-a-longs
they flashed on the movie screen
when I was a kid
follow the bouncing ball
but I can't and couldn't then
  carry a note
  it's a hard life brother
  on the inside on the outside
part of the problem lies with the
judges who must be poor mathematicians
when it comes to handing out time
and what the fuck is the world coming to
when poets shun writing for e-mail?
the old man down on Market Street
the one with no legs and a skateboard
has more balls than the President
this is a bitch of a poem
not a bitching poem
  I know you know the difference
  even if the jailer's don't
thirsting after your blood
like a junkie lab technician
stepping on over and around
dead bodies
looking for live spirits to bury
I wish I could tell you there's
light at the end of the tunnel
but there isn't
the new Governor believes
in Capital Punishment
as if death were a spanking
or being sent to bed without supper
I've got to get me a new dictionary
the one I have must have belonged
to Bill Clinton with all
its tortured definitions
the message of America
can't be found
on Mount Rushmore
it's written in blood at the Texas Book Depository
I know this guy who believes
if we reduce the world population
by a third and close our borders
there would be enough food
for everyone in the world
too much breeding he said
but this same man breeds
killer dogs and has five children
and another on the way
it's the kind of shit
that's driving me sane
just when I was getting the
insane part down to perfection
I feel like I'm the lone survivor
standing on the deck of the Titanic
destined to walk the ocean floor
with a fish womb reality
better watch it brother
you might get what
you wish for:
a new trial
a new judge a new jury
but would the outcome
be any different
The D.A. should wear
a black robe a wig and powder his cheeks
bend over and beg forgiveness
what's left of Eliot Ness' old gang
could take on the Wise Guys
outside the courthouse
hell, I might even buy a ticket
mouth a few obscenities
to take the edge off the hype
we are born we die
we spend time in between
be it behind or outside the walls
and the prisons keep getting built
and all I can do about it is write
these "bitching" poems to an audience
who does nothing but bitch
sometimes I think I ' m a retarded
space alien put here by a superior race
you on the inside me on the outside
  inner parts of a human computer waiting
  to be blinked from the screen 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 TO A YOUNG SWIMMER 




You could beat me in a race
  if you weren't afraid to
  come into the deep end.
  It's disorienting at first,
  the tortoiseshell patterns made by the light
  on all sides,
  not just the pool floor.

You slip weightless through the ether
but are tethered by fear.
I want to press on though
gravity's closing in.

See that stand of trees?
Beyond them lies the horror
of my adolescence.
I tried to drown my insecurities
in chlorinated silence,
hold my awkwardness under
till it turned blue.

I want to coax you out
but I see you are untroubled
by your limitations,
content to stay in the shallow end,
your loud pink sex toys bobbing
at the edge.

By the time I was your age
I was already swimming at all depths,
,pushed by a need
I am still trying to define.



 

Life (part II)


Every moment sacred
  every breath a blessing
  every thought, cognition, feeling - ecstacy.
  Since my world was turned upside-down
 under the glowing glare of headlights
and the scream of a friend,
  Freeway free-fall in McFarland, Wisconsin
where the cops are hot
and the medics are hotter.


    And I thought of myself in a porn flick:
“Why yes, officer, I’m concealing a weapon-
mayhaps you should frisk me...”
  Semi-delusional in my shocked zombie brain
  (80 to 0 in a flipped car’ll do that to ya)
  and almost waiting for the 3
  studly medics to begin stripping me
(“looking for injuries”)
as I sat, staring and silent
  in the ambulance
  trying as best as I could
to tune out the incessant, 
meaningless babble of my ex-boyfriend

(who’d been driving and seemed to have chosen the
“I’m-gonna-talk-about-anything-I-can-so-as-to
-belittle-and-avoid-the-trauma-of-destroying-my-
car-and-nearly-killing-myself-and-my-one-time-
lover-on-Interstate-90-in-podunk-backwoods-
Wisconsin” approach to coping).

Which had begun to grow repetitive,
not to mention inaccurate,
in his attempt to avoid responsibility -
claiming a mysterious gust of wind
(like a sneeze from God)
had taken control of the car
    from the erratic hands
and lead foot
of its driver.
