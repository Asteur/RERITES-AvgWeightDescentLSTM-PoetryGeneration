 hazy throats:

 compromise scrap, feather:
 emptying the compact life. 

 Pocket-watch goodness. Wistfully 
 Outside us, waits, and crucifies
 Wants' dishevelled circuitry bed.

	 In Memoriam A. H. H. OBIIT MDCCCXXXIII: 5 
	 
	 
	 As morning springs so quickly from the ground, 
	 Light's song flowers in the meadow's long hair.

	 We no more hear the stars once so long there, 
	 And the faintest reeds of summer's wide wave.

	 A soft warm air heavy with the sun's breath 
	 Touches the eastern hills with slow showers 
	 Wet woods rush to cover the crumbling hills.

 Nor hear the stars emitting silent sounds.

 The Argument of the Dead Man 
 
 
 I was in the middle of the river 
     and the wind was a blue blue

 And the deep night of the morning 
	 was a child being born
	 
 And a calm heart lay on the dewy grass
     somewhere unperceived bleeding

  in that summer house, hours 
                   lying down, thinking

  how the blood, succumbing 
  without loss, works to heal
      imaginable and solitary tautness





		~ + ~
                                                                                                                       



 May the wet moons of your quick dark heart 
    graze, counseling travellers, leaving 
  anemony happiness,
 watching it all, being warm.

        By the anxieties of wounds
             in desired structures 
              hold the sharp hairs 
 of sickness floating in the blood 
					 

					 Summer asleep 
					 Lifts flowers 
					 Curled sheers

And although Equality does seem rugged, --

Cycle


Summer night 
    on the land.

Then sun 
   in the first breath 
      of early morning 
	
Stars lying down 
   on frosted grass

A soft fire
   in the sky
	 
A wind 
   reading 
         trees

And then night again.

	To Be 
 an old man

  a thousand times, a tuft

	          a way for the window 
	    to own the precision of the sun.

	 The blood of the city is not a bath
      and the magic of the night occurrs

	 We have no time at the end for 
	      the shore where it kneels 
	 And shakes the secret shadow ropes
	    of the sea, twisted like a tree 
	 In the streams of the moon.

   In the tomb of the world, the knowledge of

                       that seems to be happy

 At the end of the forest (a place
             like a bird), people 
                   call storms 
                     repose.

All That I Know Of All That Is Left


	   I know your blue throat, 
		  writing as you sleep. 
			 
		 Smoke-wreaths howling 
			  over the hot sea 
			   to see my voice 
		fall so near your feet. 

		 To see the wild light
		        as rain breaks
		        into thin snow 
		            as i pause
		         on the stairs 
		     above the kitchen. 

		 These are minutes to worry 
		     about. The rain caught 
		rushing at windows, begging 
	  to hear the garden in the sun.

Sharpest Vegetarian

  
 He caught the plastic bird and stood by the wall.

 Now when the bird would try to burn him with a blow, 
    to make him bleed and be vengeful, a wild mortal 
           child, hunted by the place, tickled water.

 Grimaces. Half-trained voices: dark ground. 

 Even erosions pausing. Calfing.
 Adorations full of prehensions.

 Moralists embracing in remote hospices:
  switchboards peddling inexplicably inauspicious 
  limits honed from unreasonable ambitions, 
  newly-hatched schemes struck down as they are overtaken.

 Friendship 


      I choose years where less 
    Is sown. Let innocence roam
    To love a cruel clever foam.

 All words are orphans! I guess
  The times you hurt descend to 
       Make you hold me in blue.

	Poem Of The Sacred

 
 when I was nine 
 and happy to see faces
 seeking a sweet and wild sun
 
 I could see the sounds of women 
 and in the word of my mother's body 
 sense flowers in the breast of my mind

	 The first time I was born 
	    was a little difficult

	 There was light 
	   in the middle 
	    of the world 

	 And the Secret
	 when I was that young was that

	 	(and I was not 
 		the only one like this) 
 		though born a child  in my own body

					    I was a woman who 
								     is not 
								    a woman 
								     who is 
								  a woman.

Confession 
 
 
 I am a painter, I am a poet. 
 I am a fire-breathing Catholic C.E.O., 
 and my mother-in-law's kindergarten teacher.

 I think I think I have a lot of poems to write. 
 I have no idea   what I have to write, 
                  but I am  a good man. 
 
 I am the only one 
      the only one who will 
 			           write.

     When the sun as the sun enters the mind 
         and a wild sky enters an open mouth: 

   Drooping with fruit from thought and word  
in the West and the South and the North song

	         Foundry of the Milky Sweet Bear 
	 white with the eyes of an open question 
 
                 Silent in distant mountains.

 O 3 million years the sound of remorse

 And the sky will not be my skin

 By unageing Nadab, we let him stay alone 
 and, with porous helpless poverty chores, 
 
 Aid the gigantic idlers of the beast
 holding out the moss against wasting, 

 Sitting across from the window to find
 raw vast tapering grime accomplices for blood.
