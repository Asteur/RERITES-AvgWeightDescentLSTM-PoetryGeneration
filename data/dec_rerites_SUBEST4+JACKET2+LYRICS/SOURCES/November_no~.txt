 His rifle scrawled in his lap 
 Horrid eyes in an awful cave

 I have suffered forty years
 Times manifold like the Swans mingling 

 Cold as the puzzled Wind
 Where the ships beat away

 For I am not here 
 And I do not pretend 

                       


Stout Fields Next to a Butterfly 
Philosophy's Strangled Neck       

 Contrived to mix eternity,
  conceiving to unite careless 
  murder, salacious and vapid science 
  and to leave thirst, heart-piercing 
  strong and deserted, snowblue in granary dust 

         



At The Last 

 I felt a kind of writing
             in the heart 

 I found the one who made me 
 years ago, thinking of dust

 I gathered my dissolved dreams, 
 and hid patience in this book.






                                                                                                                       
Goddamn Winged 

 Hurts are a perfect ending 
 For the vacancy of years.

 So in fixed light and silence 
 And the numb flack of July

 Mothers of each family 
 Drag a law toward old men 

 As they decide on the graves 
 for us human potatoes 


          



O We are Reptiles 


I dance now in the the old lagoon, 
 plow the driveway, look and blow out air, 
 gnaw a great breeze, dark and
 wild as the yawning 
 years, while my many little children, 
 seditious, make jewelry water. 


 
                 


 

 At birth we are bought horror shards 
 re-enact undrinkable marrow tech

                                                                                                                       
 

 those tigers must be dead

Peep 

 watch him watching the gray 
 morning over a hermit river
 
      



 Deep in a deadwood pool 
           source shakes. 
 
 Euripides' gods will die!

 Even as time-mama-phanic stars 
      taunt paths with pinwheeling 
                  statistical loops. 


                         



After Months of Kneaded Ratios 
 
 
 Hundred-year-old avocados,
      feed the hammer knife 
 deliciously captured blood


                  



 We scaled the ochre darkness 
 tracing green reeds over the corkscrew hills 
                along dim blue limbs of light. 

 Each at every block of the prayer
  planted an eye to see the cradle:

				        a peacock on a pillow, 
			      a tongue under a frozen sky.


               



Lost As Silences 

 Start from the country, a sorrow
  weed that bends a postcard dark. 
 
 It's one more excellent foolish 
  fire to die from. 

 Attractively, its heart-honored flames, 
  call on bellies to protect circulation.


                                                                                                                       
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I open 
 my dark eyes
 abhorring my life.





     


Quiet -- 

 
 Recall this world, 
  have no hope to endure. 

 It's then so eloquent
  as if a book


                                                                                                                       
 

 Pan Moves Erratically Over a Different Bridge


 He waited, much rapturous over the world, 
 hoping the sun's scarce writing on a clouded lake 
                     might spell birds or mermaids.


 And he can't remember how to make 
  the flawed arguments of names 
                  into separation.


                      



 That day the artist-god: a half-dead entity
			 enormous, arrived ermine-bright
			                    full of rust

 Sadness kept reflecting intelligence, valerian 
   wrinkling water, the studded horned doorways, 
                         rolling dry upon rocks. 


                 



Concealed 

			 wolves. 
			 avaricious.

 sparsely placing translation-bracken thorn
  fatigue-smoking fingertips behind ash-gray 
             zealous whole-flour purgatories


                


 With the fierce light
 Of a great strangering
 Imagination entered a lazy sky. 
 
 Real air 
 Circled the hub. 


                  


 Calm, back-lit in the brain,
 considered praise or fear stems. 
 
 As a brown hawk draws in granite, 
 surely, finally, flirtatiously

 Weary apprentices stare
 at pools pale with scum.


                                                                                                                       


I earned the blue light 
 It was my happy surge, my song 
 I drew the glass, met your eyes
 trembled, and said: "By you ..." 

       




Dinosaurs 

 honeyed grief 
 spit  out 
 the last cloud 




                



Dinna Levertov 
Waits for you
With an anatomical truth
Suspended in Green jelly. 
 
 

 


She unwrapped love, 
  yes, so familiar: 
 
 Mildew, pigeons, shrubbery, 
  death! An enticing devotion:

 Silent conviction sponge 
  the line between bodies. 
 
          


 
 I am continuous:
  anticipating midnight incessant, 
  blushing truths,

 Boulders 
  doodling deepening
  causes to sing 
 
 A sweet cliff
  to extend over. 
 

         




Gagging Eve

time wriggled off alone 
 past the schadenfreude 
   celebration of those unheard



      




121311 


 The milky labor of a rainbow: 
 life-giving clumps of empty inscriptions.

 Laughing willow-vicious
 fluffy reproachful precedents 
 
 Destroy 52% of truth.



                



And when the head dwells in the green 
 gutters and moves that horizon 
 where the body wanders 
 and the stones are blocked with
 the long bones that anchor the sun, 
    the heart, and its rider, gleam. 
 
 
                                                                                                                       
 
 
 
 
 
 In the loss of the hope of what 
  it is to take in this morning 

 The storm or the stream 
  where no one will look




                    



 Warm wide-open Orchard-smooth

 Grief's forklift-curled 
  deep-green blood-eyelids

 We are lavender drifting through this

 Out of the heat beyond land,

 The waves are broken.

 The dreams of the soul 
  the first songs of the isle, 
  the breath of the wild, 
  the clear wind.



                 






 Two whistles, two thousand scrolls. 
 I am all the way into the question. 
 
 Somewhere, my chewed branches, 
   my gray birds, my goats, and
   my hands incur immense flowers, 
   as though my nerves were a suitcase.





          





Savagery 


 Riots brush Jericho Necrotic access 
  across the screaming Beasts of skies; 

 What want intent?
  a running world without position 
  a grabbed river of ecstasy.

 I have wandered so much seeking 
 peace, -constantly dissatisfied

 accepting noise as madness, rejecting 
 the war faith, glistening naugahyde

			 diving for the common honey 
			 body hides in resistant hole 


      


 'Tis time to curse this day 
     since the world's bliss is in me, 
     and the world is lonely. 
 

                                                                                                                       
 
 


 
 
 Sonnet 
 
 
 My heart is behind me, the wind turns to 
 Shadow on the fallen grass. I have thought 
 Something alone with my reason as it 
 Sits in the cold stream eating raving hints 
 Cleaned in the springs of the mixed ibises.
 Every stone a breast, a subjection
 Which can never lighten this scar loan mouth. 
 A note swimming awake through dead polite 
 Delight. Such soft ripe accents of spirit gain 
 Enough lechery to veil the canker 
 Trivia. Restraint! Random temptation!
 Consummation uprisen from leafmould,
 Wanders self-denial protoplasm.



  



    

                                                                                                                       
 hammers retexturing
 the roads, a dozen trees peel
 the wind and reveal the blood 
 of a distant solar landscape.

 Somewhere one or two short years 
  Spawn thru cracked and yellow light,
  Leaking unpredictable conversations. 

			 Raining passionate heat, 
			 A hundred colors hissing.

 there is room 
 for old age 
                    



 Where cruelty and gristle whisper 
  tiresome grief infantalises dead 
  cursed creation, perennial 
      and stubborn as a lock.


               





 Think of the grave as a wall
    anarchy crafts from flesh

 The gloss of a kennel 
    with sky for feet

 Now we say it is as if the bells dropped out 
   as if the humming lights are beating 
   nascent heads sequestered everywhere

 Nantucket light, the wind-like splitter wings

She goes inside the window for me 
  to brush the hidden land


   






		       This morning gentle rain 
		    tongues light frosty snares 
	   snaking thru tinctured sentences.

  Hollowness comes, curdling to scatter
            longing intervals connected 
  by climax. Idle, gone, a future caged

	 swoons inhaling someone's story, a 
	  wanderer dazzled by rolling light.

Shatter the light

 Where wounds have campfires

Unspooling hypnotized surround
Fog anointing an overlooked maze path.

 No One Has Ever Met


 On the sad fields that drink
 The cold wine of dark night 

 Not in forests of sacred shapes
 By quiet poplars whose
 Faces never asked to be put aside

 Nor in fire where crowds 
 Reveal the peace of survivors

 A double-edge Salad of  alchemical  home-slaughtered 
 Peaches before the tallied moaning
 That Critiques sleeping  toughness.

 Down the river, my people are not mine. 
 
 I see them in their bodies 
   moving into houses 
 
 Scolding women scooped 
   up from the shadows 
   of the dead 
 
 I am the first to see 
   the fallen light 
   of the sea fail

 Thus the city spirals 
 Do not breathe any sound 
 In alert heart's mercy

 Our lives are still still still. 
 Our fields turn time into sorrow.

 We shove a great trouble from a beige town.

 When I glanced in your eye,  
 I saw a bull in a good cloak. 
 
 I watched you suffer,
 glittering and gleaming,

 It is morning. 
 Shadows are heavy.

 Best seen with 
 Eyes that do not exist.

 I am green as the weight

 The target of a mattress

 In the mouth of the world, I am

 A home-made brine-bird 
 weeping Trakl phrases.

 Seedless exposed, 
 Perfect slaughter.

 And as the long, curling cage of night turns blue, 
 its slanting blossoms fall in slow brandy breezes, 
 Driving the hills from spring to that same ground, 
 Where moss slipping on the whole swell of the sea 
 Taught my heavy life how to fill trees, with song. 
 





                                                                                                                       




 And in the morning I pull on my hands 
 and look in the rooms of light.


 Photons are very cold 
 And they carry out 
 Days that are poor 
 That know nothing 
 and think words beautiful.

	 The mountains our head.




                        



 I realize that in a way,  
 what lives in the world, 
 lives in misfortune 
	 
	 in a sea, alone, 
	 mirrored, hidden 
	       by process.

And Down

 I looked in the nursery

 In my earliest room, 
 I was the wind in the swamp, 
 A wind hung with blue shadows, 
 The sun came to me. 
 
 


                                                                                                                       



 In that garden, arms forgave

 Well what is it, that which is the soul?

	 
	 Surely none of the ground:
	  filled with its own love and plans; 
	  the dreamt pleasures of the day 
	  more silent wins on the battleground 
	  of pendant and ominous squid

	 
 And maybe not even the bones of women 
  sturdily creeping past pastoral quiet

 Nor the mineral of some future's 
  dim soil, its spiral shadows
  flinched from an ancient obelisk

 Nor a ring in the field 
  a flower reaching 
  about the thin curled sun

 Nor the hours gestating in an oak 
  stained & sleeping in eternal height 
 
 Nor the flick of a naked shrine 
  in the shadow of our blood

 Nor the solitude of engines
  handcuffed in eggs 
 

	 I throw on a golden-crowned ark 
	  a parliament of languor spruce, 
	  and snorting thug-soup
	  save a spool of realization 
	  a convenient despondence
	  designated as incredible.

I Knelt Upon 

 the way to that last promising difference:  
 craggie sacrum torn, sobbing, behind the milk 
 of mouth, beyond the stink of this world.

                                                                                                                       
 



 Alone, among the voiceless 
 Aware of being the precision of happiness 
 A strong reflection of light made fluent 

 Bearing those whose own human glee can never 
 Bear a stranger's smile, or an animal 
 Who holds the centre of the dry knots

 With a living scream 
 In the freakish evening 
 Of your swamp 
 
 An ungraspable 
 All wanders
 On drunken terms

 Singing lazily 
 Of an exit

 Till the table is splashed bare
 With a dream where I leave 
 The language of the flesh



                    





 Lord of the Flowers I Love


 The luminous well wilded presences 
  peacefully, all night, working 
  the weak sounds, and the mountains 
  with their fingers in the sky, and 
  the flash of orchards swaying into snow 
  as flowing beige silhouettes. 
 
 Long after that year when we met 
  light escaping the river wind, 
		  lived every morning 
		  in time's completion.
 




                                                                                                                       


			 
			         I turn 
			 to the harvest 
			          guard 
			      of myself 
			      no longer

 Martyrs, luxurious, bloated on burgers.

 A slither-ethos blueprint,

 In a wing so vast, intact

	     The end is dying 
	 
	 
 

 

            





by the boat, we will reach 
 where we have been, and each other 
 own a good world to tell




                 






 Hurricanes, narrating
 concussions, wrinkle 
 in every tribal room. 

 On cool weekends 
 old pills, at meals, 
 stroll over stubble. 

 And in the veins 
 between lives,
 faces catch in 
 thoughts.

 If we do not love 
 ourselves, completing 
 the acute beauty ends.





                  




 And now, it is Bryant's iambic
  ineducable insistence prop:

 A fast-food clue-curriculum 
  rent-gang in a pilfered-drone

 Chasing candies before his nap, 
  which looks at the door mistakenly to argue:

 That this heart is a certain smile of 
  an old old innocence bathing in the sea

 Lying seduced in oak-door sadness.

 Water came in silence 
 To where I was a temple, 
 unusable, crushed under fire 
 


                     




 Wanting In One Abandoned Phrase

 
 To you I held the horizon.

 But the dying angel, 
 which I feared,
 went first to you.

 What I want, I am. 



                 




 
 I'm happy! I'm a tangled meme 
 trampling untranslatable 
 monstrous persistence. 

 I don't taste the names
 Of the prayers increasing inside my eyes. 

 My streets lead toward an empty restaurant;
 Walking plum north, I am laughing diamonds.

 Still inside, batlike, she flounders

 Golfing for honour, uncomfortably 
 Calm, imbalanced exultation.

 Absolved fumes of obscure

In The Fist Of A Dry Problem

 
 That solid elegy movement, that is this 
 one in two, each lip, travelling to the next, 
 a brain, trimming the bled wheels 
 of peril, or regret, arranging  
 the unknown inside, tuned to a shred 
 of swollen smoke, feeding to grow.
 



                



 And now the lights 
  marry the fish, 
 And I'm happy, having fun, 
 On this blustering day 
 Carrying the grafts of the drums, 
 To the Whiskey-Whizzgigs oil-permeated 
 Formal Medici account; easing to rest 
 Within the leper's world.

 without nests, glittering now, 
 in the gleam of goodbye

 I take courage from my bed. 
 I do not breathe.
 
 I listen to the light. 
 Heart creeps into eye.

 Roaring with song, 
 Hands in the ditch. 
 
 To the grave, I say, 
 To hear feathers tread.

Flarings 


 this morning gazes at statistics -- 
  its muscles pounce, grazing
      sleeping data

 undersea 
 insomnia sings,
  staining bushes 
   with mourning 





                                                                                                                       
 





 I am the blush of love-root,

 Three feet out.

 Embroidered on the corn

 And then the hour's art 
  sped within, impaled 

 I end in my lips. 

 And from what friends are not long gone, 
 I sometimes draw dust, suck thefts 
 With gold wings, photogenic 
 Love flying down 
 As I turn and turn.

 Lovely Brain 
 
 

 The dawn is like a warm tract, 
        -- tilted to the light. 


 The world is clear, and all is all the more 
 Meaning in the more that has never been. 
 


 Night smells of it.

 sundawn humming

Who Has Seen

 A powdery stone

 An arm bleed
  immense streets.

 Nothing born. 
 
 Lime mountains 
   appearing to belong 
    to the edge. 




              



 You hear a furious 
 bone evoking riverstorm 
   focused wheat.


     




Hobo 

 
 Water-maggots 
   within snow 
  sweat consequences. 
 
 Words manifest 
   as hands, or wings 
  caressing a mossy church. 

 Blood turns into meat, 
    each forkful 
   guiding progress.

 An early morning
 Moon cowers
 Among quiet shadows 
 Of infinite tautness



           





In Mist 

your hair thinks
of meadow sinking into meadow,
   lips on a shore licking a wind. 
 



         






 In this intense wounded kell 
  reservoir of despair 
  I too, sweep a blank womb

       I have no companion.
       I do not need facts.
       I hear the ground sing.




  






Thirty Years 

 No one could say
 I do not care.
 
 Infinite time, waking! Yet,
 What hurts me most is the last moment. 
 
	 In this dream 
	  a woman is shaving 
	  an airplane 
	  as her bowels
	   flower.



     






     locus dew
     prowls the bacilli 
     guarding all sorrow













 I am in a little chapel, to see 
 A sweet apple-bee breath Coltrane

  		-- break silence into trees





      






 I love it

 the manifold frost before summer
 the sky like a flower 
 the lines on the ground where the gulls are

 & the wind that rises to keep 
 the green water prodigal





                  




And Grandfather's
				pigeon-shit
				silken-sailed
				crone arms

 attain the final play, 
 bathed in kindness,

 concave, uneasy, screaming, quenched
 his descendant sex walks

 in analogy thru a thick kleenex good-night

 I still live as if you are here. 
 My hopes are dry without you.

As Made in Dreams 


 Music suspends the agony of words. 
 Reason slams, far away, into the back of the sun.
 Delight releases fangs to guide nowhere. 

 A riddled playground
 Covers the frame. 
 
 Weathered masks
 Become shelters.




      




 On this great night 
 I must write from you! 
 
 Give a world in which 
 I do not need to be.

 Let myself be invisible, 
 No more than a dumb image.

 My heart bright 
 Like a sad 
 Broken ember.

 A kept shudder carcass embalming depth.



                                                                                                                       



I break the tenderness of must --
  voyage clean to warmer brooding 


                                                                                                                       



Perhaps each shadow 
 in your shoulders 
  shortcutting fire,
   rises, to take in
 jettisoned hot dreams

 Beyond the hills where 
 a faint wind caresses
 the neck of the sea

 some trees flower before dawn 
 
 when I wake 
 I smell the air 
 in its own language




                                                                                                                       

                                                                                                                       
 
 
 
 I thought I was a place too astonishing to read.
 I lived in the mirror in the middle of my heart.

 I stretched the spools of my hands; I mapped time, 
 retrieved a blade of blood from a hissing dark. 
 
 I saw nothing.



                                                                                                                       





The Measured Wish

     aspired to meaning, a meadow 
          poured on starving flames,

     a quilt of secret somber flesh, its sugar 
    coinciding with something found 
 
 and when it laughs 
 driving thru the night, deodorized
  hopes swinging from the rear-view 
   gather cold sudden uncertainties. 
 
 
 
 
  
            


 my pillow on my hip 
 not my hip in my hands
 
               



I am born in the dark

 called into flesh 
 to slaughter death 

 a country that smells of dreams 
 children that eat the words of hired worms



             





 I thought to myself: this might be 
 a nice way to be healthily buried 
 in a contemplation of speech.

 Each day, light wakes, still, bewildered,
 and wants to know what to say, how-to speak

 And all that is absolute is restored
 In that vigor of your human body. 

 A temporary floating kettle fragrance
 Born to bite, tie shoes, and calibrate time.

 A hearth as large as an ancient empire, 
 An artist trash-pile seeking a goddess.

 A console owned by love and death, a mad 
 Being reaching through fear to resilience.









                                                                                                                       
 



 Her husband shouted holding his child 
  sped sharply to the door 
  on the ice dropped her baby.
 
 Her brother struck her, and missed,
  then held her, and took her
  back, haunted.

 The weapon of human love


 Is one way to pull the best word 
 From an agitated silent heart land 
 
 For the soul is a kind of singing of 
 The fact itself, changing its view 
 
 A curve of jubilance and lace 
 Carving a jagged fallen sky

The Lines of the Family 
 
 in some seasons we fight, 
 and have to stretch for a guidebook 
 
 wild forest cedars catching 
 cavernous eruptional 
 menacing sunlight, sipping rain 
 for faint fingers of information 








DARKNESS 

 
 is that instinct
 to eat uncertainty
 
 uniforms subject 
 to contradiction 
 
 dead doubts breaking









my hand
scented 
by the sculpture of you

 you, who 
 have peace 

 while for me, hell ascends 
 to settle around the street 
 a sun broken by the morning








 

 what will be done 
 let's make it she
 
 till she cupping 
 an uncontrollable
 alder 
 
 shows him 
 the her 
 in which 
 children 
 will









PLAY 

 
 he lay at her knees 
 and used a smile 
 to tie her hair










hypothetical lilies 
are no way  to care












 i love you for such artless
 steps at my door, like a bee 
 inside a dress, seeking milk 











 men all fear 
    the flesh

 and yet on weekend's torn nights
 after the hydrangea settle
 realize mind's moist transcendence










 
 those steps dreamt 
 
 of a regular gesture 
 of acid tracing a base

 ephemeral ills aching
 as flames in the silt










placed in an ocean 
that sways beneath a confused 
and ungraspable light


	   a map 
	   becomes 
	   an anchor
 







answers beat 
up questions







filtered
subtle animals
with sunny dispossessions 
 
 delight
 in the swamp weather 
 of this generation
 
 smell the former
 rough treasure
 dispenser 

 touch smouldering
 dreary willow's 
 radiant notes 









family troubles
 seeking micro redemption 

 elegantly unannounce 
  pre-determined acts










nothing awakens
the withered mist

its violins dreaming of cauliflower trees, 
the shape of redwoods, a river wandering

 it passes again everywhere 
 sharp lines of cellophane

 a branch of consonant sunsets mixing 
 dust and herbless ash from mercury 









my phone lets sweet rain
 and birds in the deep current 
 remind me of sorrow

 lines shed by the ground
gravity-scented 
  to wake decay
  
 








i watch the shortest sound 
 of darkness, admire me
 on my long way 
 out of nothing










PAIN 

 
 two hundred minutes 
 curve from the leaves 
 that plan the beautiful 

 that happen to erase
 a dispute, or a moment's future

 that dawn simply in birth's objective:

			 to seed space, inside 
			 you, to evade 
			 retrieved language 
			 











in the strange indifference
 of the week's implacable
 bread, each flower was finished

 it's flesh lets the night lie open 
  as it makes the tangled questions

 		    look at every new leaf
 
 







like imaginary milk
she grows softly 
and tries to live






 can you tell me why you now 
 give me this sign, as style?

 snare a robin, drink sand
 & hook nowhere, to matter?





 the idiocy
 my rhythms create 
 
 out of a bit
     of water smells




a butterfly 
licks littoral
sweat off camera  
cargoes folded before a pig









 in the hope of joy 
 i know the same
 dreaming 
 that fingerprints 
 call 'self-expression' 












  there was a moment 
 in great thick socks
  where she decided

			 i can't 
			 let myself 
			 be hurt 
			 








Plunging her hair into rain.
She says: you need to be loved.







 to echo the ocean's light
 the poison of its elms 
 pruning stars

 that reach to her 
 self the trunk 
 of a mistake









 patient blue images 
 wrapped 
 and showered

 i have a cat too 
 that's new 

 and horses, harmless 
 blue figments

 there is a catch: 
  their skins are not locked
  their infusions warm nothing











 
 i kept a cardinal 
 in my inbox 
 shining

 and 
 a few times, 
 i heard or 
 felt its stench. 












 deified 
 did i consider it 
 home? what with the music 
 every morning, and my mockery 
 poured onto the roof, and the buried 
 cold calls of heavy earth's fear

 singing over remnants 
       of synthesizers
 












 the young story's 
 graying ventricles 
 cool into a lone depth

 as she rolled on to catch him 
 flinging cracked borders from the puddle

 and then won his process of choice 
 blushed home, belonging like joy 











 we were busy 
 in the enormous
 hardwood internet forest

 pebble wristwatches 
 gathered around new 
 story feeds left 
 to rot in the sun 
 of public despair











 when anger rains
 human war

 languages 
 of happiness
 are stomped into dust













someone  

 buried a cat
  at a picnic 

     with a banker 
     designing the dull logo 
          of solitude

			 & other young shapes 
			 half-buried by famine 
			 










 moral tongues 
 decivilize dying

 a garland
 of contentious pills 
 
 the pierced shock 
 of a tree

 a night
 silence











  orchids 
  see soul
  kiss trouble










 and the pain 
 of another's company

 noticed in its benediction
 sends thoughts home 










 never greet the lover 
 on the rocks

 or the children 
 between the houses 

 or the fleas 
 on a forbidden sun

 drowning forever 
 in rooms somewhere









 when sweet must come 
 even from a forgetten 
 secret 
 
 and time comes to hold
 the noise of the dead

 as eunuchs come to sunday tea 
 
 and the many fruits 
        of a secret 
 little moon come 

  to willow rip 
  budded feet 
  on the sun 












i want
 guaranteed demands

 laden and hacked 
 at placenta gate











COWARDICE 

 
	the  clock 
		 soon     uncertain
		 disappears   in us











the rubble wildly-wailing 
 shows you its pedigree, writing 
                swamps onto your flesh










 mama insisted 

 on making a corpse
 from the untold tales 
 of fake vagabonds
 
 to roll in a whisper 
 with a keel of silk 

 	where the earth waits crystal still









body was at ease 
 a wind between 
  skin and mirror








 a hero, 
 undestroyed, 
  died, across from, 
      what was mine.










GREAT LITTLE SOUL. 

 
someone carried you
past the private incorporated
 abandoned sweetness 
                     of walls










 an excited pine-tree 
 watches the sky 
 twist augurs of substance 
 into weary tears







Luria's Illnesses 

	kicked the fists
	where songs stab out







ghetto dreams
kill them all:

 ex-jocks, myal boys, 
 hearth lords, fruit elders

  they are not only tongues









 
 peace writes with 
 dissolving stars 
 (all gold) 
 
 a strange bird,
 old and shattered
 rising from its fetus 
 











 implacable vision 
 walking through the stone summer streets
 treading on fissures of crushed oblivion. 

 stoops in glad naked 
 gloomy invented time










 coulee honey. 
 babylon maple. 
 cherry creek.







high-dive 

 i have 
 no blessing or wit, nor 
 pictures of wordly passions. 
 
 i find my way into everything.
 i wish less lives.









 the bible: its delicate wrecked tongues
 rise into the sky, thick with hours, 
 to dance in a shrine at midnight,
 and leak thunder to make many 
 methods of uniform uniforms
 prison dried under stumped
 unknown birds with lips, 
 the music of the prize 
 to tend the state 









fuck the seed fund 
 of faint encrypted feelings







 
 i remember his point. it was to say:
 
 				when i say 
 				nothing, i 
 				learn. 
 
 







 you remember how her fingers would give 
 a wish to what must be unmoved

 you invent the fatigue of light 
 a shadow awaiting soul

 you leave her more and more within borders 
 rinsing her belly with maps and rules

 you seed a garden strewn with unspoken
 rented contradictions












 i nuzzle sea-sands
 that goddess exactly made
 to seek my hand, and there 
 find burdens  become desert 
 a wing of accumulated doubts







 hands gleaming sweat 
 in her bed in the forest







 that long summer
 we dragged the gully 
 light toward the quiet 
 impossible hopes of sparrow-flocks 
 








 a wide rain of fire filled
     an empire with nipples

 a spice of truth sprouted as a garden 
  in your ear, your watched your words 
                    become wind









what shall we gain?
less yearning? 

fragment ragged warning smoke?
 perhaps our solitude?

 and in spite of ourselves 
  the odd gift? 












 i pushed home 
 the closed
 delicate bodies 
 of babel 
 
 being
 a season
 of valleys
 
 bone's positron 
 twentieth-century 
 heart-felt  dogma












	folded asleep 
	 in the core

	 is a word 
	  never 
	   loved









 
the poet fainted 
beneath the moon 

among dull pink and beautiful knives, 
where the earth had fallen out of the dark

	+

 and there is no fate
 in our thoughts 

 they live 
 in fresh smoke
 clearing the engine's glaze










 the lie 
 will die


   glimpsing an orchid 
       carrying a dawn

 









beauty moving on 
 an electrode hill

	 i listen
	 using time 
	 to play 
	 the earth 









 we enter a hard world: 
 everything again 
 waiting  
 
 we burn a rock 
 in the moist speed
 of being born

 we count many pillow-like weeds
 abandoned on the pavement











EVERYTHING 


 rides up to the borders
 gathers around your bed

+

 i feel its all as clear 
 as if i have forgotten all my life, 
 and naive, all is unread, uncanny, following all











 
 Self-Lost


 perhaps time 
 was speaking about a bird, 
 a creek oiseau creature 
 bonded to wet surface
 
 or a hunter 
 serene, knee-deep in water 
 near the river bottom
 that trembles as it rains










 in that garden, 
 the hiss of wood, 
 in circular darkness 
         is incessant










 
 a human gaze hushed
 at the root, alive 
 in a loop 
 of unbearable messages













 time tells me it's not known at all 
 
 it whirls in exhilaration 
        an absent blessing

 a human complaint behind its breast 












 	only flames
 	heed why happiness
 	stitches earth into play

	          to devour love

 









 even slow attention
 now, too, must obey 
 delusion
 











 for something to know what it was
 and hurl the last massive stars
 out of heaven as wasted light

 nobody must be missing











this family cannot flow, and so
  dies in this chair of dust 









 
 being a taste, you have no 
 concerns nor questions to dance












 i know the fresh edge of an invisible
 winter mesh, a liquid wind exploding









 
 the sky you haven't wanted enough 
 the lake of your own crying fists

 that for the miracle you

 return to morsels
 in sharp brine

 breath shine 
 & shadow ash









in the room that comes before day
 place begins longing










 i am reflection 
 spent in pity

 a river of potatoes

 wise familiar words 
 dreaming a distant star

 forlorn hearts
 letting years sing














 
   this song calibration
 has no need for a wound

      blue lime crumpled 
      in the plum  smoke 
 
         books  becoming 
                 flowers

 











NATURE 

 
 no one can think 
   to learn
 
 a mirror spins 
 straining facts
   to love










NEVER FORGET 

 me 








 In The School Of The Birth-moment 


	 waving 
	 writhing 
	 melting 
	 floating
	 singing
	 flashing
	 breaking










 sorrow knows how to hear 
 what time will not tell
 
 







 of all that we most know 
 the law of each other 
 is needed
 









night's sun kept
whispering to god 
to come taste the bile

 the walls of fog sweeping
 over bright screens, tender 
 soft electronic blessings



 








consolation

 and there are no pearls 
 no holy poet's work to loathe 

 just temptations and torsos 
		    rubbing branches
		      over the wrecks 
		       of homeless faces 




 








SHARK


the price of his glittering house 

 the air that lambs him
 in the torn smocks 
 on the blood flow 

 and the shack 
 bleached glow
 cock blunders

 show the heart speech where
 the ocean will be destroyed. 












ALL 

    the grace  of seized
    certainty-free sleep

    is an oddity 
    best-expressed 
    dead











 summer says: of course 
 all things begin free 
 
 in ambitious recurring
 bright days, where sacrifice 
 revives faith for no purpose










STONE 

 
 the disordered moon in the baby is 
 welcome to become, not art nor dust, nor 
 a wrinkled voice, but driftwood, peacock-shrine 
 cut, through the fresh lungs, a lubricity 
 reads, in sadness motes, a meager vitality









 
 he's she? 
 past engines, 
  otherwise extra. 
 
 i have spoken 
 of all the things 
  fucked. 
 
 so it can leave me 
 when it sings wars. 
  we agree. 













 love the world

				 your voice 
				 this moment 
				 is
				 










 in an impossible way 
 life must be 

 faith in a house 
 somewhere shattered











TONGUE 

 and your silent cinema imitation of green 
 photographs and summer rocks 
 drives the sunset to cut 
 water

 you'll exult less 
 when you feel more














distances 
 made in confused cries 
 pluck a stalk of infinity
 
















 love becomes dust 
 grated used-up
 not good for anything

 











 in three 
 enigma-born 
 dream-poems

 a blackbird sits in my hair


 










gate husks the certainty 
of swimming fitful winds 
 
 vents threaten me from the dead contrary
 night with muses fed on uncensored data














 the selfish 
 wind shield

 its eyes barbecue 
 regulations sleep

 its book severs meaning's 
 immutable grief surfaces

 human things 
 hidden in the eyes 
 of fruit












 i love the swampy pear 
 as always, more saint than calf 
 a home saturday once designed 
 
 by hunger's hornbill 
 an art of tiny hands

 my father hates
 any land you live on












DEATH, A HOUND 

 fused blue and cultured 
 eats cutty-shark manure 
 reins of static liberty

 like flat stars within a sacred leaf 
 emptying swans out of a hollow skin 
 
 the everlasting 
 claw of the teeth

 bone-broke
 brainless 















PRIVATE ROOM 

 in the opposite sense 
 is twice cherished, or 
 scrubbed away
 into electron flecks 
 of backbone 
 complaining walls











OUTSIDE i am scared

 flouds 
 mr. folk 
 pariah ether 

 cities dangling
 by the blanket 
 tangent olives

 forgotten hoahwah
 story mesa 
 breeze clocks

 something has happened to x 
 








 a destiny
 body made 
 
 a crossing 
 escapes 
 the tongue 
 
 my board 
 smells of
 nostalgia 
 








my lips 
cascade
melanomas

almond orange
cry clear
looks









 north over fountain's snow-covered winds
 ears strike a supervised precedent

 to disperse the sea's 
 warm seal of hard 
 enslaved cameras










 you hear the house see

 imagining a queue of leftover
 animals linked in sexual 
 chronology










in the arms of this muted 
 loneliness 

 nothing moves 
 micromanaging 
 
 the sudden perseid bones
 of resistance wounds

 and ruelle water
 battered by forty years 
 of artistry










 
 
 sunday, six-hour star, honey, the lone sun.

 death becomes an alchemical favorite
 a big funeral sentimental 

 web buzz raft









Dub nerve chorus 

 the logs are asleep
 and ore a winding intent 
 deep within a chain of houses 
 perceived swallowing light
 snakes in the distant air




















 saw what i say i know

 you land
  inside me 
 like sky 
 
 i forget my eyes 
  to kiss 
 your hands

























 
 
 
 i wept here
 across the milk gates of the factory 
 while my father began to erase 
 money with a mouth-sternum-navel-cleft
















 i have suffered the 
 intimate nerve thoughts 
 of rock dry 
 conspiracies swirling
  wonder














THIN HEART 

 
 here, awake, hold me 
 at your bosom, let no scorned 
 grass politics clanking muffled 
 pierce the salt meadow

 blurred feeling
 wound enough 
 to guess














SPEECH


 enormous hollows flung bright 
 from the pewter array
 pilgrim moment 

	 fear 
	 to sing
	  enthusiasm 
 
 as when i left a pair of dead 
      kids rigid burning

    prayer owner's upheaval 
        after hate 
      made the point in me 
 











 3:49 dawn, always 
 here, i regret
 the wind in her blue coats 
 
 salmon-pink alloy 
 cucucurrucued evaporating










 a fading brightness of horses burns the way 
 sometimes a sun somewhere in america was 
 
 measured in a riderless decline, a 
 sparrow-flock of angels in a plague of suns










militant 
 tongue asking 

 shadow to jump 
 through defeat

 bridges 
 shooting fanged agony
 from honey machines

 pine-dark dogs 
 tar canku rows

 hitching friezes 
 where ancients sleep













I see

 night cause this saying

 what follows spying on
 the effect of the rest

 planted on mountain's peak 
 love demands all-love-forever












time-girdled, imploding
    they wake for love 












don't take him back. right away. 
 flames, like stories, die.













 let love ripen again, 
 let your bones pass over this universe.














 we did not know 
 the glow of things
 the shine that made
 day swallow our paths










dead water
etched into 
 unicorns

  oil-coil & pork-sky dreams
 double-hard, darkening-wild
              snowblue hands











 only nothing 
 the feeling to be
 such separation















		 we are born
		 stalking 
		 last-gasp 
		 lust










 raw pods of rainbow hair




 
 old meals 

 my soul already wanting to lift 
 nowhere,          bent barefoot 
 by the fence          with rain. 
 











every wave 
 is a model
 logic farms














 mankind sustains abominations 
	 money-hungry and happy








 orchids to pencils
 one antiquated dot 
 
 rare charity 
 in violet harm 
 bridges  crime
 
 one hour of such надо, raised a way 
 of casual birds, a beard addressing napalm







					 we have forgotten
					 we were raised 
					 to pause













 i love how you watch the glass 
 that separates me from
                the photograph












 sin. 
 
 i, the falcon, 
 planted the southwest
 scratched soil 
 flew trembling thru fog











mind is a smudge


oxygen wax 
 
 veins 
 in the bleachers 
 of the visual propeller

 peasantry car meat

 misery piers 
 ninja planets








 
 
 i sit at home 
 a sky in a photo
 
 a sliver of flesh
 burned with light 

 brandishing 
 nothing
 
 an adamant singing
 declaring  the sun 
 











 my story is 
 like a voice
 which sings 
 when it cannot











 sit, cry no longer, find 
                      a calling

		robot offers 
		ignite answers

		we are mattered 
		   fate rhythms









Sipping on Estrangement 

 
 he sighs over early-closed flaws
  contextless phone calls missed
  flights that stopped the fruit of together 
 








 sicken 
 silent 
 sad

 even though 
 the world 
 is planned 
 similitude 
 
 paper-thin 
 self-effacing
 lost dreams
 come to smother
 happiness









 beautiful men thresh flora diamondine 
 impolite free sandstone parcels
 
 where the headland pliant 
 satisfaction bore deep scars






 
 i'm not saying we're right 

 stone lifts naked
 magazine oil egos

 a punished bird 
 unbeheld morphs 
 into silk blood









 love struggling
 along the field

 redeeming gestures
 of ochre sea-spray

 winter's precise 
 guarded  amazement







in the womb 
 of manhattan 
 scattered on gloss 
 between pine and snowy wires

 anguished yum 
 on fluted agave's 
 discarded pavement 
 











 big and clear 
 wrapped in ignorance 
  
 i count things 
 i am  dreaming










 the future slid preying on us 
 in the peak of the dawn light








 archived orphan tumours
 cut home in whore steps







 a never-ending winter
 opened the long odors
 of an impending  song








	 language 
	 throttled
	 trees










death-spasm
twist of stars
ate dog time 
 
 wept
 a button
 spurting









 mouth ranged into the street
 whirling translucent in the hope 
 of some other







  people told dead 
 heaped empty webs 
       sloth yarns











 our hearts returned to 
  weather the fallen 
  debate of the floor

 recalcitrant 
  rings screwed in 
  narrow undulations

 burning cliffs 
  silently pitted 
  with gas bridges










 hiss light 
 and cure kin 

 whistle at the guard of blood 
 
				          when 
				 chance laughs
				   death feels










 

 i toss love down
 i get up

 even the sound of god 
 ignores me

 i build a table from the horizon










by your slurried window, 
 the only place you never are

 rabbits listen, and  
 a great stone spasms 

  birthing a shy 
 inner metaphysical  
 springtime









 
 dawn 
 commandos oil
 the formalist you 
 
 ah, the sum of homes 
 
 a cloak of paper bowing among mangroves 
 a desiccated summer glowing in the wind

 asleep with swans










like the doctor
 whom the words ash 
 in cargo

 i lean 
 to thrill
 disguised

 meditation 
     bridge 
     crumbs 
 










 a mole attitude
 blooms in the real poem

 a statuette of rain
 a pet kept by a crowd










 
 
 i have not always been   
   what i was, so i am happy
   when they come, and we is sick. 
 
 we have you, they think 
    to wake without, and 
    soap the mountain.
 
 i want to talk to you with you
   until you forgive me.

 w/out u, i'd have 
   no birth at all 
      no childhood.













 the enigma 
 of this leaf bloom
 cures the backyard

 what's to come after the house
 expiration? you do not want details
 about it: that last need of being

 you hide yr pain in pride's moment 
 taste a future known only in symbols











 a seer furled 
 becomes hush endless

 offal, a friend
 caught in a vinyl mirror

 a rage of telegrams; a legless 
 animal burning; an invisible 
 floating rock










she wants an inflammable 
 scrap horse in bed

he knows any good aggragates
 will be sent ill-luck

she notices courage's small legs swell
 as she touches him, he blinks shuts











why tell them 
 everyone is ravaging nothing

 foreshadowing neglected
 synonyms weaving 

 a pulse of lakes 
 i need to watch you -- 
 














the worst 
 is love 

 that deflection daoist 
 poet held like the pen

 void, unwanted 
  human nature

  united with the floor
  you are taken and cry













 summit of contractions 
  those odd antique stones groping 
     a row of afterthoughts 

     	 +
		 
		 i fetch a false arrow 
		 and sow  power

		 to save one mocked
		 bulging
		 strangeness











 adversaries thread 

				      a trance for 
				 imprisoned
				   fledgling trees
				  
	soil swaying 
	 like molten bones

	     bread hardened 
	           into words

		        walking dusk 
		           into desolation














 every day a woman 
 passes through a dark alley 
 of industrial beech light 
 
 touching the apple-red agaric wings 
 washing a glossy hare in horikoshi mustard 
 
	 sipping resveratrol
	 to awaken the heart











 nature

 tells someone 
 about anywhere
 
  nothing fails













		    bless me empty
		          softened
		             heavy

    in a throbbing chair
          of blood hunger

 something burns the grace 
  of eternal loss, becomes
       a polyphonic canker














Being answers


 a cage with no retreat 
 a bowl of sturdy moments

	    & wonder
	    goes on 

			    before they 
			    declare you

			    	   over












 i will open 
 a holiday 

 at a little distance
 from unlistening

 and touch
 only the almost 
 beautiful enough

 at the edge of the poem
 offer weeds as gifts













    acumen
 describes
 the night

 rescues moist
  bravery, and shakes
    
    as thirty pills shoot 
    a wire into awareness 

 
 







in the covenant of women 
 a path quickens

		   all afternoon 
		        it rains 
		 
      each place falters 
   catching the light

 dying to display desire 
         or lack thereof 










 beauty

 physiological 
       in time
    not heaven

 wakes a handful of confessions

 stands, letting midnight
 play within it, grinning










 a flutter 
 of rendition
 speaks of god 
 
 as if he or she were alive
 in water striking literature 

 no duplicate 
 tasks to improvise 
 
 not even death,   marked 
				   to talk 
				   to this spot 
 
 nothing makes it the word 
 of my seizures  against 
 the stillness of hope 
 
               past 
             space 
          implies 
     endorphines












 one lover's back
 pulls holes from
 the field's sand 

 damp with empty blood




	 life juice
	 locked within light
	        shakes stars
	 
	  unflattering hills 
	   flail into prayer 




 a trough
 of lovers call
 feelings a mistake 
 
 their glittering 
 squinted jurisdiction
       sublimates care 
 













 two blossoms 
 turn bed
 into garden 

 book 
 a pulsing sky
 within water


 undulant
 accursed
 moments

 full thrill 












we talk 
 what others
     think










 a kiss is
 a cardio problem

 stitched 
 felt 
 satellite lines

 indignity
 whiffs of emotion

 a mud echo 
 shut into the hours 
 beneath slang










Inside
silence

 beyond 
 what i am thinking

 i am alone
 and will never be born


			  time eats 
			  the words 
			   of worms













come, speak me

life will still 
be just this 
 








 
 as stars spent
 words they could not 
 feel

 their green hands
 cut odor

 all i have done
 at last, becomes
 a stem











the shape of doors

 remind me of wheat 
 beneath the plumage 
 circling echo

 a narrow nadir 
 open and tuned

             a gun 
           inside the shed
          smearing shadows











 hoax children
 no longer turn
 stones into air 
 









 i sit on salt 
 my mother said

 phlegm, so necessary 
 only a wretched scent of sleep
 belongs to higher things










she runs home
to the soft-conched bush

to explain how the child 
 didn't like me, and how it

 means nothing because
 i am listening to you 











to eat is to be known, to get 
     glittering self nectar 
    from flesh meditation 
 
   to remember what
 you must see, perhaps 












 

 
 beautiful anemones
 
	   sounded 
	   wounded 
	  confused

	   sweat 

	  on sunlit ground
	  in full-unfolded

	       riff stroke madness












	 for       me 
	 here forever 
	 it was rough 

	 loud    silk 
	 sweet spikes 
	 mist pattern 
	 
	 crow  paralyzed 
	 highway chladni
	 harp reservoirs
	 
	 dirty    harm

 could we have said, 
 again, what 
 is precious

 what the sagacious 
 howled small cynical
 great narratives 
 had convinced
 the mother 
 blubbered mind 
 to like

 and to borrow my ear 
 so we might 
 shut in them 
 the beautiful
 feeling pieces










 it starts in the morning 
  out of the heavy-winged 

 veins of
   reason:
 
 
 the first 
    singing 


     +


	 behind me 
	 a thing is
	    kneeling

	 unable to keep 
	      any secret 
	 within its reach 












 
 
 in one bones 
        again 
 there is rock

	 & a tree 
	 eating
	 a potato

	 a chair
	 covered 
	 in honey

	 a sparrow
	 on a bus
	 smiling












 in the morning two days later 
 blue sounds strike the valley
 
 and with judgments crack
 what has always been invisible
 









 when a dream shifts 
 its position 
 
 it shreds the whine 
 of inherited stones









 she lies on her back in the field 
 and feels the screams from the city
 eat into her beautiful ears








germinations
 turn death 
 into sex







microbial sympathy routine








 like the heart of a lake 
 we are wounded with time

 bound by blood's secret
 dust of favorite things 
 
 bright
 quarrelling
 valley











THERE IS NOTHING IN ME. 

 except pandas
 stirring empty 
 unknown shadows

 lovely ink of blatant
 transparent fleshless 
 copious corpse clouds 

 motor virgins of lichen 
 whispering that the body 
 destroys what she planned 
			 
		amputated wings 
		in an abandoned cradle











 a hope i thought i achieved
 toiling in the alley  
 
		 like a trip 
		 without baggage











 to thank the mess, she said, is not right

 maybe its a favor to drown
 what life shows in books 
 
 i hate to find this page in my body

 printing me till i live to explain
 how-to become old, die without fret 










Spring frowns and falls 
 towards the world 

 crowded with yarn
 irrigation light

 a robocounter
 in the fields 

 a beach 
 sparkling 
 
 arms and breasts
 appearing from folds

 dirty clouds
 budding taut  
 drench the sea 










 mercy passed on the next book 
 of those not speaking love -- 
 
 we know that they stayed small, optically- 
 positioned to pull in the breath of people










freedom is what nobody is:
 a core absent mystery 

a gleam sewing faces into inaction
  as if there is not enough to do 

plastic tape-roll peeling rocks 
 to reveal little meatlockers 









this strange 
summons visits
    every brain
 









in that ancient room-- 
 there was something 
 the opposite of home

 an answer snail, 
 a pentagon econolodge 
 a mad silly translation of time
 a chimney before dawn, a trickle of cold
   loam pointing with your whole hand
   			  toward fermented windows
















ballad's concussion 
 concludes in drool

that's the way it is 
 it licks anyone who looks 













 
 do you even see me? 
 when i am not in bed? 
 
 and do you see your mother's 
 fingerprints in my mouth?

 and the petals on your neck 
 trembling with rules?
 
 and the sparrows 
 in the swamp 
 carving hopes?

 or the sun 
 playing ancient cellos?












Some of that rain
 stabs reveries 









 
 a foot-path for what is crushed 
 a pure horror gulag fountain 
 
 every grandmother runs through it 
 












NOTHING 


 we saw eyes dream

 in home-sick skin jails 
	    
	    wrappers, 
	     greater than any 
	   distance, thought 
	      around the body 















Woman God


 let's be clear
 each day is a lever


	     the naked church
	      refuses to take grief 
	         into the machine 
 












 
weeding self-pity
 

 black cars moved 
 over a sagging cloud 












Last Tone From The Ancient Fabric Of A Child


 curling on her lap, the hush 
 of oak trees, a silver trout 
 with winged horns, and a soft    rain 

           thoreau shows how narrative
              floating awake like that
 cryed for years in the blue sin











Where We Stand

 today we gave our money
 to feed one life

 our emotions weighed
 our replacement 

	 we held the deep 
	 paths of the wind 
	  
	    to make sure  
	    united chaos 

	 wasn't a transitory 
	 lotus breakthrough










 pills by sour peaks. 
 my neck calligraphy.
 
 unwilling bread sculptures.
 rooting mountain poster rock.











 the end is filled

 its ample hands 
 hovering over bright snow

 its white horns rolled 
 in cellophane startled 

 touch sheets of sludge
 from the dryhtlic dance-off










 joke rage
 
 
 before that 
 at the point 
 at which i'm still 

                     here 

    people's skin
    devious amid melting fists 
         ate buckets of births










 restless stuff
 absolves disorder

 what is it i mean by this? 

         i harvest foliage 
         that burns my heart

			 i am
			 a sinking boat 
			 on a locked tide
			 









 
 
 we won't trick minds
 
 or ascend
 with touch 
 to join the stars 
 when you die

 	





		   complicated fumes 
		   root in numb fire














chant 
love
each day

sing a spectacular music 
outstretched in the grasses

forget your animal body consumed 
by light expanding fogiveness









music on the floor, 
 poised asleep on the edge outside of things 
 in some place  where molten

 mosquito rock 
 intelligent shows
 possibility pity










 my heart eats ashes 
  others love me 
 
 i like it at home
 i have these analogies

 i feel lulled in with sides
 a еспредельщик contigous grin 
 
 a solace that stares as it grows











angel 
 of structure, i fall like a tear 
 into torture ditch code: 
 c,d,d,b,b,a,b,a,a,c,b,b,b,c,b,d,b,d,c
 
 i see the hunter pushed, head up 
 into the bathroom, preening. 

 i hear you shut the takeout box
 that bears my name
 heaped before the tv













 whitman's fake appetites
 make the x listen back









in the golden hotel 
 eating cake 
 despair gates
 
 clockwork cusp of sycamores 
 lined up, yawning, seduced,
 lost in wonders' fibrous machinery

 endless anomalies
 dusting the dross 










 1000 amber deaths, & a little wind 
 set out to remember lyric stone 
 debtors' trysts, power salience











bitter future anaphor
 
 a forgotten echo
 bare and for sale

 a vast sweaty
 stolen wild residue

 fading bereft
 limp salt rim

 ruins 
 sufficiently used
 becoming archives













during this dance 
  sky cracks 

  and lust
  (a rubber ducky)
  watches 
 
			 tyrant-haters 
			 gang-fight 
			 










 
 i. 
 
 the countless salt 
 in everything


 ii.

 a word, a tiny word, 
 round as mercy


 iii.

 a lifetime lit 
 by speckled rags 













 after the perfection of the feast 
 we were not supposed to note loss 
 
 or brick-strewn trickle grapes 
 sagging where payrolls whisper







 i remember the sounds of heaven within the whale 
 








 and so the waif 
 (sheathed chasing 
 crowded water) 
 watched the village breach

 clamouring with time 
 at the entrance to a velocity 
 where expectation slipped

 
 
 





infinity sometimes
is a danger 
tearing despair 
from the pattern-book of dream






the true road was commotion 
 an overgrown aim 

 behold my mind by the sea. your 
 side under my mouth, succumbs. do 
 i create you? ready root glare 
 of my body, an email flood 
 that tries to let light in






 thread distances
 before they pass 








 open the chaos

 a flying tongue
 squeezing language

 				

 let relations 
 come home 
 to illumination 









evanescenct war


 imagine tomorrow 
 just received 
 an unreal fever  










long ago now 
 a secret mood 
 hid behind 
 an abscessed hand 
 
a suffering god palsied 
 with wrongs
 became the land
 as it rained












 p. placing her hands 
  on the lyric and tubes 
  of stone
 
 remembers the singing 
   wind, hanukkah 
  cleopatra intercession
  pleasure

 shoots my lap 
  flute, that curse of father's 
  jagged letter savanna 














FRANTIC 

 stirred and fragrant as any dream 
  reaching she reverts me

 we spoke for a moment
  left 
   in love 
 
 for this is the year
  we pass the heart sirens 
  bleeding pause 
 
 the pale impossible noticed 
  bronze-gold spaces

 the ribs that fill this bed 
  with song-book hammer valleys 
      beating dirt into smiles 













the paralyzed priest 
remains undiscouraged 
 
 Idomeneus singing until
 the flower of heart's 
 caress scatters 
 

         beauty holds 
          a cold bell











 river tore 
 around the bricks

 ushered and scrubbed 
 past the meditation 

 up to tree 
 on a fjord 
 to warn you 













having seen fear
invoke drama

 i watched in distress 
 my teenage txt recede
 into gutted emptiness
		 
		 ancient words
		 waiting in the sea 














 reboot all installer code
 awake as a lifeless alert

 










 you're the first thing i saw:
 the scent of grief, fresh-washed

 useless grime enclosing
 a weakness amphitheatre

 honey-suckle's embryo trench












 morbid grass on dead 
 clouds moldy sloshes 

 the decaying nameless wise shadows 
 and the reflections of the welcome 

 a clique of suspended penetration



 





Utfus


dolphin mustard with milk 
of rum and pale summer wood 
 
 frogs around the altar
 the fingers of a child

 a yak-hair table
 at the heart of yes





 
 biased thought      making 
 a rainbow from lawn chairs








I Wish To Be Closed In The Intimacies Of Love
	 

	 a pool open 
	 to the bottom of history 

	 children floating
	 on fluted rain 
	 
     the deep cream of an unerring land













until 
 time-lapse pollen and water-clock care 
 swarm regret visionaries in a chorus
 of flesh-traded brand-new raving

mouth 
 will release  a shadow 
 of sewers among swamps 













 because they were screwing 
 on our hairy chairs 

 and splintered particles
 were escaping through 
 a fine hole facing a fire
 
 rages, disenfranchised, 
        conjoined cliffs 
 











 get upon her 

 spread and drunk 
 crammed in

 clinging to a weight of coffins











 where ashes 
 never-living

 softly beat
 a disturbed task 
 












		with a frown 
		full of honey 

		 i surrender
		 to a past 
		            
		    where passions 
                imagine me 
















 john cool gasps,
 grasps twilight black

 blue ashtray glass, picks
 green flowers shooting

 hidden among 
 green stalks. wakes 

 everyone who won't enter 
 the beauty. the ceremonial

 celadon paths that run 
 to see coyote flaws spring












 
 solitary huckleberry 
 in the bright bottom of the void










 
 Fleece-hustle Taste

 I summon ash, pine-forests 
 and bubble-awe high-risk flocks











a flame rare, endures, nothing 
but a cataract of foam-flecked talk
that cries out, upright and massive
for the troubled stink of sleep











the house they dragged 
 out of the daylight 
 talked 

 









 clay
 argues with the moaning
                     sun 
 







 
 i think  of glitch
 sex prairie wolves

 tattered     books
  
 who seem to write the fool 
 and kiss     the nest home













 xiii 

 i cannot dream you  
 beauty   diseaseed
   smooth in my bed













 orchestra isolation 
 without ambition's mushroom
 cut bones into the color of isms










  
 poetry flows in joy 
  above what moans 

 all climb her 
  light 

 to drink warm 
  wine 

 and gaze at 
  bearded spines

 huddling in the brain 
  leaking wet cochineal spice














waves
 a broken ledge 
 a pool of bright fronds 
 a jail bulletin
 a metronome 
 a death-note 
 












 in this model
 the ground
 doesn't matter

 and life floats 
 toward loss
 leaving lullabies 














folded breath

 approaching a wall
  of mild appropriated 
   saturation

 peak
 transparency

 where words
 scratch self 
 with speech milk













 so often dust like the feet
 of an illegal tree 
 comes to spill the muses












 
 this afternoon 
 all the sunlit 
 songs of water run 
 toward cool mute twilight



 
 








 
 devil's muscle draws
 empty cream, brick 
 jockstrap roar 
 and hungry skulls 
 quiet and young

 that's the wisdom 
 of this dead thistle














Forewarned In His Sleep, Honey-Gold Baby Worked For Me 


					 to smash 
					 the mottled now












birds belong 
 to undulation songs

 a repertoire of moves 
  arisen in accident 

















 i am ur-cantos, 
     uncountable mock-solar-flares

  “peace” clamped to saran-wrapped 
 inmates in mass-market holes of fate

 		let us wash this ground and go on
 














despairing and incomplete 
 in a lonely cage of gentian
  skin       drifting 










	 torrents of dna

	 scuffed ledges 
	 where lambs 
	 feather mouth 
	 cinnabar fields












 angry are their paths thru the games 


 sounds are dry here, their souls 
 mandela in america

 death is the shadow truth 
 of meat, apollo's peace 
 
 now even when they can will it,
 and even if they shield a heart,
 they are alone, lost in steps





 






 a post-hypnotic score
 weight 

 reading her pattern
 shudders











CHANGE TOO LATE

 
 on the last crucial rail of light, 
 the void does not see the vaulting
 turning air, nor cities folded 
 as they lie at home, dwelling in
  venus' orbits














 adorned duress 
 inside gown albatross

 arranged red tents 
 and stonecrop unities

 reverence the way 
 they're mutilated 












 they listen on these nights  
 to an elegant shift

 forgetting the tracks 
 inside the interface

 they want to be 
 platform sediment 















i smell code 
 assert blood















WORLD 

 
 opened his past 
 perfect eye 

 his team impossible 
  lowland  enclave 
 of pompous clothes

 his mint weather-hen 
  swirl of dappled bowl 
 executive-proved awakenings









 together at a picnic 
 of pastel-drawl deeds
 and sensitive velvet-ice









 
 show me, once you've fallen too far, too long 
 in blue, through my dream where mother hidden 
 and free shines, while dad hearing me, writes not 












 a mind in pain i am 
 tearing at cherished words

 the body's fresh rewards 
 scarcely felt as growing 














 Kerygma 

 in the latitude of the way, they choose 
 to sleep, letting the law of things
 pack white wet privilege 
 
 we enter with those folk, 
 bound in the name of you. 

 to sing: i am digestive soul 
 perched numb on an old wise song
 for i ask nothing out of love 













 
 every spring must
 kiss the stream 
 bent with snow 

 prisoners without feeling
 rinsing the valley in a knot
 of enflamed breath
 
 










 
 i am smoking a persistent nazar: 
 a field encompassing maps, colony- 
 lines, slave-reading light as it grazes 
 its primary-braid of north snow-gestures










 Calm always deep Hyperion
 is an island stuck 
 in sherbet like a shell 
 inhaling regret tallow 










 sick driving
 a plastic code
 and the perfume 
 of crackhead matrix 
 cornbeef jumps stinking 
 over her high birthday skin
 hernia leashed to altar-stains 
 











 a muse calls to its peers: 

	 an om orb, at home in the market, 
	 a resilient heart thicket,
	 a thin statue, bare-legged,
	 a guest, thrown out, pacing 
	 chronos who sells ringing

	 nothing filled when alone 
	  believing knows












 
 
 i hear obedience weeping
 swallowing gravel

 as the cold old one waking 
 says: what is broken is bad















 Perhaps They Crawl


 to lecture the carnival flower 
 to rust the chilled reptilian cicadas 
 to leap-frog monuments 
 to chide dewy plates floating like flax

 in these a kind of gratified order has happened













Who Came To Shit Visions and Desire?


 Poetry with a beautiful mouth 
 cheating the sunset out of pain













Hard Flower 

 
  a tree's child
  calls a rock 
  to the agitation 
  of vegetable touch















 now i am chalk.

 and i regret to be
 the yesreaderyes -- that 
 heart anecdote taken from me

 i'm old and rare and torn
 
 and i am sure voice now realizes 
            sound is an acid jail.


















 We Number It 
 
 
 iii 
 
 and point the mountain's lines 
 and swarms of autumn
 toward my dad's hut

 where he said i thought 
 it was what you wanted. 
 
 i cannot taste you, 
 the way the cherry relaxing 
 tastes voices or analogies 
 as pieces of african rock, 
 sea-gull, doorbells, or grape.
















 in between, friendship
 was a difficult love story

 slow endeavours 
 to access her belly 
 to dry her eyes

 i am not talking, nor am i waiting 
 to see perhaps if it fits 
 explicitly in this impeccable














 racing with breath 
 in perpetual pain

 guarded like emptiness

	 remember 
	 that god 
	 is looting

	 quiver
	 sufficiently perished -- 

	 inherit yourself 
	 
	 there is no zero here 
	 




	







 
 time engulfed us 
 to nibble this willow 
 
 bed 
 deep
 swells

		 the significance 
		 of a misplaced heart
		 in a fierce tent of ribs
















I Am Writing To 

 the bullets & the windows

 water is too confident 
 nothing is empty 
 
 i've no room for that














 spider 
 listens

 opening 
 love 

 as it instructs 
 soft dismal knowledge

 to imagine
 living exiled 

 among stories
 of a sea-worm soul














dawn fields

 kicked upward laughing 
 at their own flood

 constricting the smell of snow
 to where shining first went


















Mind By This Clay Breathes
 

 unconstructed and ensouling, clear. 
 windy and numb, reversing. 

 later a landscape is spined out of it, 
 a victimized bump, and desire below, speaks.



















The Last Bliss 


 those bright lines 
 in our spine
 are silence

 i am kept
 in a movie 
 in a coffin 
 in the gutter
 in slender sounds
 suspended over a lake












 my third instinct
 through a graceless
 angel cyclone cuts holes 
 into angry infinite blues













 shadows sang 
 to the holy woman

 her wounded hair
 seized the gate

















I Close My Face On The Stems


 a photo of candles 
 on the path
 where i am born 
 
 air shining 
 by the box of answers 
 in a summer room 
 
 i am eating 
 the sound 
 of a heart
 to calm the moon
















 

 the song's air
 supposed the wrong thing 
 
 sliced the tender
 last book
 
 shaped a picture
 with rules
 
 made time
 wiretap space

 removed
 our content 















 the scent of things in things 
 holds a serious bitter radiance

 body's mind, light-footed as nothingness,
 promised an entire cloying rumored lice-oil
                    love    reconfiguration

















 for what is not is what is 
 in the hole day forever whole
 
 head must break off hand 
 to choose an hour 

 draw on a puddle 
 of faded butter 
 a rumor of the sun














i will write three short dreams today. 
 
	 
	 in the first: i touch a prurient 
	 cheese, then purchase a nose. 

	 second: rivers run inside walls
	 looking, unsuccessfully, for windows

	 third: a blossoming lignum-vitae
	 offers a sauce of pleasure
	 to dead ruined letters 











melody believes in meat 
 
 darkness hard 
 revolution fossils 








how does one paint grief 
 on the elegance of the infant








Light Was Wasted On Us


 the night is full of comments 
 
 all-new roaches 
 fluffing death

 my heart is thinking how 
 i miss your presence











 balance laughs 
 a secret joined 
      to progress











 convergences leak 
 a precocious blood-lust

 as naturally as one might
 hold a howitzer 

 i was saying 
 this always 
 in bed 











 
 There Is No Therapy Now


 liberty, dying, receives a future
 melody written to forget

 wrought in the garden heart
 haunted by the climbing

 boastful 
 celebrities, choking 
 inside discards bags 











 forests and darkness
 require guns

 beloved curieux 
 madness 
 under the oaks

 toys disappearing 
 in a roar of primeval
 being

 while in many minds 
 some interior kind prometheus 
 constellation scuffed
 construction star
 burns in the shadows 
 
 and at the edges of it 
 is what i am not sure 
 











it once seemed 
that wisdom came out of each word
and phenomena sang a rainbow 

 how is it that the poetry of miracles 
 understands substance as a barren 
 shuffling of books and roots?











 phony corrupt
 gushing counselors 
 breed juxtaposed 
 on the table

 river 
 light 
 faces 
       the ocean

 we wake 
 to go again










 i am happy as i chant 
 past suicides 

 gesturing at glands
 broken in me



	  like me 
	 the grass 
	 brings in 
	 a body 
	 sometimes 

	 awakened 
	 to hear
	 the hidden
	  free i 











hungry songs 
in your etymologist 
 crown leap out 
 remarried 
 same-sex 











  talkers ween with fear
  the south lawn studs 

 patiently vague
 worksong raw 

 swimmers who
 deceptive glitter 
 among thrush waves

			 plankton
			 solace 












 there's a vein 
 in this song, a zeal 
  useless
 chrysalis of silence












 
 limbs. 
 i remember, 
 one.










 under the feast pulse
 in the mouth of nothing

 above humpback rhythms where
 people sign crosses, my father

 plays with a beautiful
 quiet bivalve of doubt

 a wind full of foxes and pebbles 
 flashing cuticles of saint thigh 
 








yet you
 found what you sailed for 
 to hide the clearing, no need 
 of doubt, no need to end 
 in your centre stone pain









And Die 

 to have a choice, to live 
 cling to paved wanderlust

 play the tender sheaves 
 of their graves

 a packet of warm blood 
 and blind abdomen lice 
 crying up from the sea











Our Witty General Woes



	  diamond unperplexed 
	 she spends her language 
	  expiating rotating cages 












 the light smells
 bent-winged 
      of crimson
        dreaming












 at the end 
 drawing dust 
 on the face 
 of fantasy









Your Metal Be Done 
 

 grief (like bees)
 redeems an archipelago
 inside a mirage






 
 tyrant flux







 the room stands

 	physically 

      	when i fall






 a bird in the asylum
 its mouth leaks home







 you are born enough 
 no doubt you can be      beautiful

 








 my body is sutured labyrinths
 a love nourishing mind thirst







NEW 

children emerge from the wreck 

				 flaw ordained 
				 pinioned dead 
				 rumour poised











Grief Circles Forgotten Trees


 what i can't remember 
 of this place 
  sings itself

 outside there is 
  a dog, a beach,
  stones, a console, 
  a highway, planes.












 and we are hungry, we say 
 for the ideogram devotion 
 
 we discuss, it is assumed,
 the cold balcony shit god









 a little moment
 migrated into fingers 

 & ha! 

 flow by ashen
 contemplation 
 
 oak united naked 
 damp water smoke

 to love the seizure 
 wit broken entrance

 i remember the word 
 laid hot to sweeten











 so people went to the prison 
 the racist ruined black wind

 the fresh emblem of the wandering echos 
 a gap gurgle stew of twine turbid doors 











Hate The Same 


 i almost wanted to do this 
 to hear you talking

 but no, i live my name
 enumerating 
 its couplets, ignore 
 my tongue 

 until i am a glock swat 
 invitation 
 halting wounds












Toothless Sextalk


 husk drawn to the sludge
 lips, rewarded with rain 
 
 overcome by dust
   engines unfold










 a starved whim gently stands
 wrapped in possibilities







 for troilus, the year  
 during which i'm dead 
 was dangerous










i hold a zen love
 spun

out of perfect insects
 shuddering in the wind 
 
 i draw my cedar back to wine: 
  ripening  satisfied













You Woke

 
 summer dawns 
 inside bread 
 & wild grass

 long skies 
 drunken butterflies 
 cream whispers 

 sound makes us 
 dwell and fall

 







tender sticky and open

	you stand 
	  at the rose door
	and crawl inside
