The 
pitcher of water
  stained with 
lemons,
    thrown 
across the room—

I have no patience
  with hysterical 
women,
    but 
I do admit

I was afraid
  seemed to 
meet
    no 
genteel resistance

with the table, the floor,
  the sharp 
edges
    of 
the white stucco wall.

If it could have remained
  thrown 
forever,
    without 
landing

or consequences,
  never breaking 
into a puddle
    of 
glass shards

commingled with pith
  and rind in 
a place
    far 
west of Eden...

Miracle 
worker of the jigsaw puzzle,
under his nimble fingers, schools
of variegated tropical fish divided and coalesced,

three thousand scarlet tulips bloomed
to inflame the undersides of windmill blades,
fleets of sailboats, schooners, the Titanic

itself rose from its soggy depths complete
with miniature light bulbs to illuminate
her affluent upper decks. Daunted only

by unbroken stretches of sky, he assembled
worlds with divine haste, only to crumble
them back into the box when barely finished.

Soon though, sections would be lost from one scene
and resurface in a distant relative
tulips on the Titanic, ineffable fish in a windmill.

Worn out from sitting, he would take naps
with notched pieces still crushed into
his papery elbows, cohering on his skin

into scabrous meadows of pressed cardboard,
the underbelly of creation.

That all that is me
Is a pity!
The wood gatherer
The blower of ashes
With whom every thing would bloom in hand
Is
Ablaze.

The beautiful babys gone!
Some doctors would say brain trauma
Others would say encephalitis.
Whatsoever doctors would like to say
About the cause of breathlessness,
I, her father, would like
To cry my heart out.
Ours is our words
Words which are but bloody pointed hooves
Digging out remote rocks
In an absent horizon!

A woman
Stretching out her hands towards a wordless shore.

A woman
Sized to emptiness.

A
Woman
Naked to the ground
Chatting up her soul
Dreams of nothing.

Nothing
And the sea would be on fire.

Angels lurk behind colonnades,
haloes fading like an untended campfire.
Like a dead bird, silence dropsthe tired sun, 
neurotic minstrel, crooning its madrigal 
in the key of frustration.

I am a master at building temples
in which I never worship. 
Desire becomes my Trojan Horse.
Morning arrives like a cop delivering a subpoena.

Standing like a young king beneath a barren fig tree, 
I am ready now to garb my quest in sackcloth,
to drive nails through the palms of everything I know.

I pretended that spring was my sister,
summer my concubine, that 
my ambitions were blessed by the sun.

I beat my effigies as if they were pinatas,
finding nothing inside them
but dry bones and the stench of formaldehyde.

What will we do now,
watching grass grow
like stubble on a rapists face,

knowing the altars we destroyed
were never holy?

Where do we go from here, 
now that words are lost 
like gewgaws in an earthquake
and silence swarms around us
like the vultures of an empty prayer?

Below sparrow, starling, stork—nothing that gloriously 
soars.
Species that skirt treetops in search of the next near
perch: backyard snag, old chimney, spilled grain
or shapeless carrion, whatever view is closest.
Not these swallows rifling over the peak,
careening, missing this hard ragged edge,
bottom of a crumbling stone sea at ten thousand feet.
Wings whistle in and out of a mountain’s
cold shadow. Blurs stretched down to desert miles,
racing the horizon, soaring through the blown body
of evening dust and out of the fettering dark.
Weightless bodies scapeling turns over stunted spruce
topping the still turning light of a brief world.

—for Kurt

She says not to bring anything
home for dinner. He doesn't.
He leaves the city to settle

into its odd and new accounts.
At seven, he finds a magazine open,
a cat sitting on the kitchen table,

morning's unwashed dishes by the sink.
He brings home books on Chile and Portugal,
destined for a school report, and the last

three day's newspapers covering the latest
rock star to join what his own mother called
the stupid club, the famous dead.

He’s not speechless, but knows the tone,
what the words imply more and less.
He gathers the details—split peas and rice,

cornmeal and flour, milk and eggs—
sets the oven temperature and timer,
closes the pressure cooker. He leaves

instructions, then slips on his boots
and coat, walks out into a torrential
evening. Rain drips steadily from the bill

of his cap, runs down the back of his neck.
He reaches out to hold a branch aside,
cold rain slides along his wrist and up

his sleeve. The hillside huddles
in shadows. The creek chokes.
Oak trunks, the air itself,

slurred, slanted as the wind picks up.
He returns to the house. Cornbread doughy.
The cat sits on the unpaid bills,

unanswered letters, unread magazines.
Lightning strobes blind the windows. To be
more alive, sometimes you die a little.



your shell unclenches
reaching in to / grabbing
onto the

muscle: tongue.

i thumb through your
layers. you unfold like
leaves from the
stem, like letters
written against

rocks in june
or your
flesh that you
had scraped away with
the metal like

i had. like we had
both tried to forget /

your jaw prying
showing
your teeth off
like stars.

in your
struggle

you are like the
veins. you are
like the tears that
drip
you
are

something i
do not understand

, yet.

you & i are
like geometry.

the shapes, the
whole circumference

the lines that
fold on our skin
still

i keep writing you these poems
that have no words.

they sit on my tongue / expanding
in my saliva.

they are small feelings:
as soon as i inhale them i
forget their significance.

they are single words like
move or artifice
sliding
down my finger tips

i watch them fall off of me,
peeled away like the bark of white
birch trees.

i push them to the side & watch

them dissolve into white noise.
i am left with this:

i cannot write this any more

Dogs bury bones in earth,
up-end flowers that were live
now dead and wilting fast.

Buried bones have shrouds
of creeping phlox that cover scars
in earth like buried pasts.

Here we sit bone-deep in cluttered rooms
with things we cannot throw away.

I might need that broken coffeepot
or youll find cause to use
that splintered fishing rod someday.

I have, I am,
one shoe of a pair, and worn.
The years have passed, now theres time
but nothing left to say.

Degas, you so loved a dancer
that you gave her immortality
in scenes of flight through air
and it doesn't matter which way
you portray her lips or mouth
or legs in lift so high
that we dont see the marketing
of female flesh, the blood and sweat
waiting in the wingsand all there is,
is grace and tilt of head that hides
a tear, spiraling to plop on stage,
exhausted tear, sister of the one
who never made it to the show,
the one that Degas hides.

The Redhead knows all about risk.
Last night, she was with him 
flirting, trifling, letting 
his hand brush her breast
just for the rush. This morning, she's 
finished with him. And if you 
have the guts to askwhich I always do
shell tell you, he was just 
one more hormonal storm 
in a lifetime of lousy weather,
another too-smart stranger 
helping her into his car, helping her 
out of her clothes, another calamity 
with her name tattooed on his butt.



Dry weeds chopstick-click
as earth shrinks from human contact
and colors flee from bole and branch.
Seething grasses scream, a wild surf.
I am not meant to be here,
in this dark bowl of canyon.
Any moment, the skies will grow tidal-wave.
Drowning is a possibility
even as I walk in muck boots.
But I have dessicated at the blank wall,
shadowing my loves. This morning’s high-tide
pried open my windows and awakened
energy. Dawn’s secrets ray
through an open gate.
First and last on earth, I witness
the buried seeds burrow with a will
into storm-battered soil.
Why is it the shadowed trail
down which the wild deer leads?





Thirty-three hundred wing beats a minute
—in figure eights from those jointed hands—
keep the ghostly wings
hovering between worlds.
To see them folded and the bird
a minuscule sphinx on a maple twig
was something like seeing time
suspended. Eternity’s long beat.
A clawed foot lifted
and pawed behind what must
have been an ear. Christmas trees whirling!
The throat feathers flashed red, green,
red—an indecisive stoplight
gone wild, freezing me,
then just
gone.





ere was no password 
or handshake to gain them entrance
to a world they transformed day by day,
only the work
that was their bread and their beer,
and having it meant staying alive even if it killed them.

And scratching down to bedrock,
crowded into caissons darker than their lives,
they tunneled like blind men without hope 
while bricklayers and masons 
lifted up and lodged the hewn granite slabs
like puzzle pieces, any one of which
could crush a man.

Like Rilke’s gaunt, ecstatic angels 
caught in the city’s massive spider web,
they climbed the feverish heights of the bridge,
handling cables a foot in diameter,
threaded the tall needles of the towers
again and again, each stitch exact as a tailor’s.

Roebling watched them from his sickroom 
hearing the music his father had composed,
that his father had died for—
the bridge poised like a harp,
the voices of his men singing.





at we uttered in the climax of summer,
in the ignorance of mid-August—
haughtiness, sensual love—has been erased;
our garden’s lyric made virginal by snowfall,
by a white so conscious of what it bears
we fear our own unconscious sense of it.
But knowing how winter emulates the truth—
that digging out after a heavy snowfall
affects those qualities nature most opposes
—pride, willfullness, transcendence—
we pick up our shovels, a red scarf ablaze
at our throats, and having redefined
our winter existence, at least temporarily,
hurry back along the path, shivering, exhausted,
to stand, fretting at a window, looking out,
imagining the splendor of an early thaw;
and warmed by our desires’ inchoate heat,
our eyes anticipate the inevitable budding,
spring’s twin revelations—the peach tree, the plum,
replenished at last, shred by living shred.
One, the improvised blessing of what we intend.
The other, a presence only, a sensation,
a metaphor the world insists on concealing.



When 
it rains, the river plunges 
over rocks and the rocks 
ring like bells. Prayers 
swirl in the slick street. 
The sheets clipped to clotheslines 
unfurl, their white targets 
growing gray. The roof drips 
into a crater of mud.

Mrs. Tarlick comes back to her spotless kitchen 
to leaf through a Life Magazine 
and worry over a pot of cabbage soup. 
In his bear-spotted pajamas, 
Al Miltie walks outside again 
and pulls a glass tube from the ground 
and records the moisture levels 
in his hardbound blue notebook.

As my mother steps from a shiny 
red and white taxicab 
in her stiletto heels, 
I press my nose against the window, 
leave breathprints on glass, 
and a black umbrella opens its ragged 
wings in a bright yellow tub.

The iron ball swung 
back and forth. The din was so loud 
our children held their ears 
and trembled as the force of it 
vibrated through their bodies. 

The building shook 
and swayed more violently 
with each blow until it buckled 
into a mound of bricks. 

A light in the distance made 
a window on the darkness, 
where the dying grail 
flickered. While trucks rumbled 
over the rubble, a long 
tongue deciphered the dust 
and debris.

At our feet, a pool grew large 
and still, inky with oil. 
The statue of our city's protectress
held her eyes shut to the stink. 
It was time for us to leave, 
time for us to find another 
boarded-up building. 

A silver trail drilled 
through the murderous dusk. 
We carried away what we could.

Hook 
perched on my fin.
I snap the line; she starts again
coming in at a different angle, fathoming
dreams too plain for me.

She craves my chomp and shake-
My prized pike and unsnagged self
And I give her a single splash,

leave her cold in the empty wake
of my thundering wails.

Sip-slippier than cigarettes, crumpled avenues,
thought-fried papers, a license, butts scattered across
the sidewalk, smashed. Someone smeared on pavement,
another child down on your pale cement heart.

Bachelor bell weeps, each a tangy gong and bent;
An endangered ring, my naked fingers and your crooked tie.
That California woman looks very in love. Happy wed-
(Straighten your goddamn tie.) Ding! Pigs fly.

Calm resolution settles just in time for solstice, hovers
like a second hand security blanket and I do, I do,
wrap it around the fabric of my jubilant hangover.

Surviving a fitful kind of night with the 
year’s first cold in my chest, throat, ear. Like rough seas. So 
with all that murky darkness swamping consciousness I'm particularly attuned 
to the new light. Before sunrise, clouds carry red halfway across the 
sky. Then sunup throws a cold stick of yellow across the blue cloth of 
sea. She comes into the bedroom riding an ivory shell from the shower. 
Better already. 

Fine architecture can be man's attempt to 
equal or surpass nature. Sure, Im appreciating the usual on the 
commute to work: cormorants on stone, birch standing out from oak, harbor 
island’s battle against years of erosion. But when I get into the 
city each weekday I’m ogling façades, modillions, entablatures. 
When I turn the corner from Batterymarch, knowing April light this early 
in the morning hasn’t a chance of filtering through the phallic 
financial district, I’m stunned by feminine light cupped on budding 
branches of a pear tree on loan from Arnold Arboretum in the northeast 
corner of Post Office Square Park. 

I stand under it in mystified awe as if 
it were a Giotto saint. No light at all anywhere in the vicinity. All 
blocked out by One Post Office Square, Bank of Boston, State Street Bank, 
etc. Where’s it coming from then, this gold nimbus? There it is. 
Mystery solved. Through a minor crack in the wall of buildings, low sunlight 
is reflecting off the top-floor windows of the old building at the corner 
of Congress & Milk, then caught by understory branches of the pear. 
A curative light.

Now I’m fascinated by the building’s 
lion-headed cornice, its green & white tiled heraldry I’d never 
noticed before, what with CVS & Copy Cop red & blue awnings on 
the ground floor causing anyone to ignore the whole building. Really feeling 
great! Until, further up Milk St., at Cosi Deli, a Boise-Cascade office 
products truck in the driveway blocks the sidewalk, forcing me to circle 
into the street, & suck down a nose-full of cigarette smoke exhaled 
by the guy in the passenger seat. When I turn back to see the poison’s 
source, it’s the face of a shipwreck rusting at the bottom of the 
sea. I hightail it out of there so fast, coughing & gasping for air, 
that I could very well have the bends by the time I descend, again, the 
steps of the Orange Line trying to make it to the shore of work.

While staring wistfully toward the outer 
harbor, the islands, & beyond (toward Portugal & Spain) on the 
fast catamaran, sea spray, salt in the nose, local lobster boats dwarfed 
by distance, the Nora Vittoria suddenly slows to a crawl. I turn 
away toward port side where three stockbrokers, raving about an earlier 
250 point surge in the market, hush up, in awe of Rita the tramp 
tanker with her Panama registry, her hull like a tight black dress, smoking, 
the whore, taking on all-comers: Maersk, Hanjin, Evergreen, Hapag-Lloyd. 
A Boston tug escorting her out like a thug pimp: $1,000 for change of 
structure; $1,000 for change of name; $1,000 for change in ownership; 
$300 for damage, $50 for extension or renewal. Visceral sadness evident 
in the brokers as the lady ambles slowly out of the harbor toward ports 
unknown. Sense a lack of freedom. After all, none owns a Seaman’s 
Identity Card needed to board her, requiring medical certificate valid 
during the past two years, documentation of previous experience, & 
three passport photos in color. Wasn’t it Freud who equated the 
desire for travel with desire to explore the body of a woman?

Puritan-gray evening in Boston, 
I find on a long traffic island 
suggestions of smokestacks, 
the dead rising around me 
as serial numbers and exhaust. 
Tourists prefer someplace else, 
that nameless intersection 
familiar from dreams. 
But I was always already here, 
among the young orphans with old faces 
safe under Plexiglas.

Once, before there were children,
we walked among old gravestones
(stained, tilted, corroded teeth)
from which the names had faded,
never thinking wed be back
and women would still be leaning
gloomy elbows on window sills,
waiting for night to dreamily float
into view, vaporous and immense,
a melting ashen swan.

I.

Of course I write differently in springtime: snow white
letters have melted. Ice has turned into tasteful rolls.
Every eye a small god watching over green and blue
and buzzing telephone wires. All over the world’s ears
demand songs, drummed, hummed solo or in groups.
We are dancing, dancing for the first leaves, dancing
for the resurrection of old trees—we are here. Here.
We are. We dance. Here.

II.

It lies crucified on the street, this frog, flattened
in the dirt. Open jawed, curling toward heaven, sun
dried. At a distance resembling a sole, a relic
from earth’s past, it was stopped mid-jump. Fat flies
gorge themselves, then lift off, blood on their wings,
heavy, heavy. Their larvae that will hatch tomorrow
still sleep. One would like to imagine they dream.
The blackbirds circle. Here, too.

t rests, this suburb, restlessly, cleansed
with hands and rags. Like the world
up-spindled in one afternoon,
like the garden before courage
became bent and limited.

A son-in-law reads the Sears catalog
to an old woman. Eight carats and seven stones
fly by. A count can afford such things.
Read on, young man, the page with the wristwatches!
Curiosity branches past the window

or the wall and listens: the station clock jumps
as if this means something. A young woman
washes her rust-red hair, rust-red water flows
into the basin, the pipeline sings. The woman twists
her hair. She, too, listens, this woman.

Apples fall into carriages, a head
is cleaved on the bridge railing, never grows
together again. Where was this station,
where did the son-in-law work, why
did the pilgrims come? None of the town’s pain

is my doing, but I am becoming used to it
like a hand learning its letters.

Insomnia,
Youre like the gods
Trying on costumes in a dark room.

Young Ophelia brought me tea,
A book,
And a blanket to hide under.

For three whole days
I watched her trace her shadow
With a finger,
Mumbling nursery rhymes.

At night, I saw Ophelias mad ghost
Sitting cross-legged on the floor,
Whereupon, at the site of me,
She stuck out her tongue.

A woman was dismantling my lifeline
While I instructed shadows
To stay close.

At the seaport,
Saint Augustine gave me a lamp.
We argued over chess
And hot tea.
His laughter crumbled mountains.

I insisted that his ears
Were the devils white mice,
That the china doll in the store window
Was his dead grandmother.

The morning, he said,
Will preserve your loneliness,
Whereupon he turned himself
Into a swirl of blue smoke.

Inside my lamp,
I made little animals from clay
While everyone else
Sailed out to sea.

It was late in the morning when the sun was finally 
persuaded to rise, rinsing his gleaming teeth of fire with yours at the 
nasty slipstream of memories, crushing angry passion flowers and wild 
berries among your virgin forests to face the day like a man as he must 
without youand why must you be always so cold and serene like the 
distant stars? this sunny day is like any other among the serenade of 
sorrows that remind you of cold battles foregone and old soldiers deserted 
like nobodys mundane businessit was late in the evening when 
all the bottles of perfume finally rushed to woo you and your aroma and 
musk of richness that made the sun go quietly down across the yonder rivers 
like a dandy whimperand so the sun must rise and the sun must set 
and the sun must cry and wry its useless hands till youre aflame 
and nearly all your rivers go all so blatantly dry

Your face is all over those tea cups and 
wine glasses and 
acrid, honey laughter 
Your Indian face and name 
that I can write no more like 
Indian rains and lightning 
Your face is all over households that
hold their breath 
in a silent prayer of nonsense, 
chanting some litany or 
other 
for your return, 
walking along the bluegrass 
of Southern Avenue 
as the rains tumble and fall, 
as the rains and 
your face and 
the rains are all over the place

tep 
outside your body sucking a hole in the air and make it
get divorced, debased, or sick; lunatic, it does not feel, per-
mitting you—the authentic self—to turn away, a stranger; the
shill love—conflagrates lighting the dark with flame, acheless,
providing combustions of air, he’s a sick fucker anyway, it’s
not you burning but some depthless maniac; you possess
rectitude, do not deserve to curl, let it lie beside her path-
ology while you, racing, orchestrate, accomplish, deposit,
virtually innocent; split, it dopplegangs admirably, certainly,
sweet, it purrs indubitably, familialy pecks and accepts
pecks consecutively; pride to God, thanks. She’s stiff-necked
but it nuzzles her edges seethingly, a prince of numbness,
a pain-absorbing fake suffering nobly the disillusionment
of love like a made-for-TV stud, flickering, on peripheries,
bracketed by Campbell’s soup, while at the world’s center
you cooly by the fingers of your eyes peel words off the
page and paste them to your brain, a flapless scholar and
devotee; let us praise detachment, compartmentalization,
inaccessibility, indifference of the heartless warrior to the
side of his slaughtering—and the splintered man in the cor-
ner watching himself being slaughtered. Will not break in-
to blossom, the stepped-out-of body, but will absorb ov-
er-plus till blood. The Lord is a shepard that maketh, no
hand shall smite, he shall protecteth as of a wing over sor-
row, shall be no heartquake in love’s pressured jaw, nor
green trepidation, and man shall walk away from his corpse.

ainst my will, I rip down zipper, shove porno before 
face, grow
tumescent, and rape myself. Rapist fist-squeezes, tears undercircum-
cision tissue, violences orgasm into toilet, and bangs away like a
striking hawk leaving me on carpet weeping. Crisis response team,
rape squad, description (shot sharded glances in mirror), unpredic-
table, unexpected, brutal, Caucasian, fled into the night of self, vast,
anonymous like a whiptail; rage, not sex; revenge against distant
abusers; howl in heart; injustice gnawing cerebral wires; I've not
confessed—shame—he’s hit before, cracked open hard core 
and
beat incessantly ripping out my stuffing and fled like a murderer
into my soul, slaked on subjugation and spermatozoa. I can take
victimization by his hunger no more, the horror, the shock, the
degradation amidst a beautiful world, his closet appearance ir-
repressibly, he’s always within dead bold perimeters, his shoe-
toes replicating mine and the gutturals wrenched out his throat
iterate details he could not know; Karen’s tampax, Sheila’s 
lub-
rication, the exquisite blood orange and yellow pipefish, the
unexpurgated yank through caverns of emptiness, cravings of
Joyce, weird tectonic schisms in the earthplates of stability; my
superinformed assailant confusing me with identification; smash-
ing my dick between fist with jackhammer-aching arm, he hal-
lucinatorily grunted, fucker, you are me, then incomprehen-
sibly vaporized the instant my come threw me off its string; pride
terrorizes—I’ve slaved, I confess, for years, homosexually, 
pain-
fully, grievingly, plumbing swallowing my esteem; the tidal sucks
off a devastation—home. No more: hazel; six feet; gray wreath-
tonsure; straight teeth; cupcake mole, left shoulder; mustache;
olive; one-ninety; deceptively soft spoken; black bush; left lobe
crease; fiftyish; big fingers. Grab handful of flesh, wrap fist, rip
him through sewer grate to light, to justice, imposter, fake soc-
ialite, slime-liar, hit/run impresario, abominator of stainlessness
and gorgeous stacks, chickadee household blackguard bastard.

at 
whom you stuck your tongue out
near the clothing aisle,
shopping late one night—

her face when she saw you, in jeans,
walking strong and alone,
your long hair flowing
almost to your waist, in plain view

and then your tongue, suddenly
that rude glint of metal in the fluorescence,
the first tongue ring she’d ever seen

then the smile you hoped I’d miss,
your kind, winking eyes
and that little girl’s face

breaking slowly, slowly
into a wonderful grin.

Furiously scribbling in the late afternoon,
this young woman
who should be dancing,

who should be sitting somewhere
posing for a portrait

or learning to play the violin
off the Aegean Sea
a thousand years ago.

This young woman, who sits
in a coffee shop, furiously studying
and scribbling—

who pauses sometimes
and, raising her slender wrist,

brushes the hair from her eyes.



I knew as he tilted his bristled face
Toward my cheek what would happen—
I knew that it was Saturday, and work

Had been left in its tinny resonance—echoes
Of metal banging against metal—
That all week he’d hardly slept, 

That the floor collected unswept
Dust like forest nettles, the insistent
Sun reddening the sediment as it fell.

I knew that there was no time 
For shaving, that some things went on 
Like those jagged hairs—half protruding 

Like a rock’s tip from the thawed
September earth. I knew he would rub 
His tangled half-beard against my face 

Just to hear me laugh in the few hours 
We had together, that I would struggle 
To get away when the laughter made it hard to breathe

That I would, years later, after a summer 
Of Saturdays, struggle away completely—
My own ringing laugh bouncing off walls

Far from home, my father gone, and I 
Would turn back in the pointless dark
To tell him to do it again,
If he still could.





s I set the point of the nail to the trunk
My father said, You’ll kill it eventually,
Just by hammering in those few—
But do what you want with your life.

How could it die—the grayish nails
So thin, the scaly bark hardly flinching,
The tree looming up at least eighty feet,
Only a trickle of amber juice backstroking
Down from the wound?

How could I kill what was not mine to claim
With such small onslaughts, the pounding of years
Focused in four or five swift strokes?
But I continued, I buffeted that dark spruce
With nails in a circle of silver, dressing it
In a metallic garter that runs so far up the leg
It becomes carnal and withers in the memory
Of innocence—all so I could learn how
To hammer, how to build, how to trace my heritage
In level boards and mantles, all to glean
The consistent knocking of metal against wood,
Like a counting that once begun never ceases
That grows louder and ends with the end.





You are the type of person,
who can peel away at your own flesh,
revealing the bones you possess
that others do not.
Like an additional metacarpal shoved
into your rib cage
scored with articular depressions,
or the studded scapula belt wrapped
proudly around your hip bone.
You display these miraculous additions to them.
Expecting from them applause, wonder or even attempts at imitation.
But you shouldn’t have taunted from your moving jaw line
about those sticks and stones
or shown off your skeletal frame and its delicate whiteness.
Nobody likes to be outdone, not even at the frame level.
Because of this, they threw rocks and preformed surgeries on you,
leaving themselves with their hammering heartbeats they possess,
while you do not.





One of these days, Christopher,
you will not remember me anymore.
There will be no more dreams,
where I am standing off to the side,
uncaring and aloof, back turned to you.
You will not feel angry,
when you think of how things ended,
nor will you shudder each time
you pass a black car on the highway
and look in to see if the driver is me.
You will not look out your window,
hoping that I will approach your walkway,
reaching my ringless hand to unlatch your door,
with a dozen yellow sunflowers,
apologizing for failing to love you back.
You will only raise your eyebrow someday,
in absolute surprise at yourself
when you hear my name,
and realize you had forgotten all about me.



Jessy 
      Randall

Years ago she bought barbecue Fritos
at a highway rest stop, and her fiancé
asked “how can you eat those?”
and she knew it was over between them.

Now she is married to someone else
and they drive into the gas station
and Mona goes mad, literally,
she has to be taken away in an ambulance,

she tries to refuse, she talks very quickly,
she does not make a lot of sense.
No one tells me this for days. I just
wonder where she is, and if she has the flu.

Now I think that Mona should
stay away from cars. Obviously they
are the problem. If she rode the bus,
none of this would have happened.

Mona’s medicine keeps her
from thinking she can
write the Bible of the future,
from thinking an Angel of the Lord
has come to earth to tell her how to do it.

Mona’s medicine keeps her
like a man keeps a woman:
in one room, safe, cared for, trapped.

It keeps her from being herself,
only much, much more so.

It keeps her out of the hospital.

It keeps her on the phone to me, whispering,
crying, telling secrets that everyone knows.



In Lirong, Tibet, Buddhist monks keep an ancient burial 
  rite: they chop up 
  the newly dead and leave for vultures on a sacred mountain.

—New York Times, 07/03/99

Oriental rugs, armoires, old prints,
And more! we read in Sunday’s tiny ad.
We hoped to find some decent furniture
For not too much, just other people’s junk.

A clot of traffic filled the one-lane street
As people tried to park close to the house.
We walked up past the tent with three cashiers,
Pushed through the creaking screen and found within

A tidy place. An oak veneer gleamed under
Lacy cloth, a short fur coat hung from
The shower rack, an ancient breadbox bore
No rust or dents. A woman laughed as she

Tried on a netted feathered hat and saw
Her borrowed glamour in a tarnished glass.
My husband, in the basement, found some shears,
A stainless steel commode, some telephones

With buttons like half-dollars. It must have been
A widow, old and ill, who died, whose things
Remained, laid out, all groomed and scrubbed and cleaned
To ease the feasting by the circling birds.

The summer air hangs thickly in the day.
Young boys bait strings to crab, their hands stained red,
The garbage barge roars faintly in the bay,
The spangled banner hotly wilts, outspread,
’Til fevered sun itself begins to flag
And orange runlets seep across the clouds
And streaks of gray bleed in; the dark lines drag
The steady hearse of evening that enshrouds
The muted city. Listen: the shudder of
A fish upsets the twinkling shipyard lights
While docks creak in the wind and far above
Clang masts of empty boats, and from the night’s
Dark vessel muddy figures disembark
To heave an unknown’s body in the park.

Tomorrow I will meet someone I dont know.
Just yesterday,
while I was trying to figure out which grapes
have pits and which dont,
I caught someones eye.
She smiled. I smiled.
We could have been friends.
We could have shopped from the same grocery cart.
Today, I wonder
what kept me from asking:
Is it the purple or the white?

Night leaches into morning,
gray dawning gray.
My eyes suffocate beneath their plastic sheathings;
I rub at the corners
and they fuzz, settle like fog.
I cloud my coffee with cream 
and dissolve my spoon in it.
The first sip blunts my tongue
as acrid caffeine mixes with fluoride;
I drink more to keep myself from retching.
The newspaper crackles like dead leaves.
Acid gathers at my fingertips
and everywhere I touch, I rupture a word.

Yourself 
and light, being both mortal, have much 
in common. 

*

 In the sky tumbling overhead 
threaded on stars 
you encounter another emptiness, 
that is not yours.

 *

 Evening 
leant too far from the top-floor window 
and fell.

 *

 Now the sky puts on its hat 
and at last it is dark. 
The same darkness grows 
in drawers and cabinets, 
at the back of your throat.

 *

 Open your eyes 
to the morning.

       First 
there was the bird. Then the sound 
of your voice beside me: I'm leaving.

You 
left, and I felt loneliness scraping out 
the inside of my bones. My brown shoes in the rug 
were abandoned tanks.

A 
new tenant, age will have moved into his 
eyes. Mother will have laid out blue cups and saucers 
in the front room. They will sit with heavy arms and 
smile. Where once we lay on new sheets in my old room 
without speaking or touching.

Light 
dies around the door and he turns away. 
He quarrels with sullen men who govern taxis down 
boulevards of water.

First 
there was the bird. And now another, 
calling to it through forests of pine. 



clearly
it was obvious
billie holiday had pocketed her demons
like found coins

as if in her spirit
my lover was falling backward in this cosmic petri dish
spinning spinning
an oblique grindstone in the sun

clearly with a touched and deliberate timbre
sorrow spotted her ordinary empire
like ripening bananas

in a vintage coat that displayed what she was made of
she walked with me
both hands squeezing my arm
drenched in chemical vulnerability
as a winter machine
swooped down
and hocked our dawn

her painterly fingers tracing
a likeness of a galloping stallion
into the ashen snow
on the hood of my chevy
became a lasting memory

eleanora eleanora
your aboriginal beauty outlasts the storm
never a question of what you kept
never a regret for things handed down

i remain 
fingering one pocketed nickel 
listening to a needle 
grind out 
an endless spinning line





When you passed
i inherited your crown victoria
ironic, i thought
how something so cherished
could fall into my inept hands

i took the winter train
to cleveland and after signing papers
focused your headlights home
along the lake
intent on selling it over it's market
profiting from all your upkeep and daily washings

just outside the city limits
as cold rain dropped
fogging windows
a phantasm slowly materialized

you appeared riding shotgun
neatly dressed and twenty years younger
repeating your name aloud over radio static
could not capture your attention
aloof, never veering from the windshield
where wipers battled

suspect, i reached out to touch your shoulder
but like being caught with my arm in the fridge
it immersed into your side
and my fingers pulled at strange cool molecules
like lips mouthing silent messages
you, the ghost that undresses me
the tranquil pretty corpse
the elusive song of night fire

once in my driveway
rain hesitated
i cut the engine
and darted to my side entrance
as my key slipped into hole
i spied your reflection in the storm door
and admired how you stubbornly remained
in a stillness only disturbed by
quarks rummaging through the damp air





Love goes.
On a pulley.
(Or one of the other fucking simple machines.)
That cry
the cry
of a wheel.

Massive that someone
stands in that open
barn door there above.
An intelligent animal
ready with a shiny hook.

Now.
Christ unspeakable our loss into the dark.





Where are the stories of Sherwood Anderson? 
Deep in the national forest of Ohio.

A child is lost 
and everybody is alive: 
"Set the hounds loose." 
Hounds gone off, 
not a prettier sound.

Silence, silence 
and that bird of death at dusk 
we'll never see: 
will, will.





tarting with the orange twisted with purple mist 

As it dies away to green flashes beneath telephone 
Wires like tepees declining with the daylight

  We 
thought we had caught

On canvas with the threads left from another 
Attempt to cover an era of sleeplessness as it slid
Around the edge of the competitive knot too tight

  To 
stand outside at night

Remembering hookahs and watering one
Slight blade as it is pressed below a dark form 
That must have been here before and will remain

  After 
we finish remembering

How the natives had made it so much brighter
Luminescent wordlessness in tongues we will never
Translate or break because we will never feel the pain

  Or 
capture their way of mourning.





I neglected to tell you

about the love summer when herons were drooping above fourposter 
beds
and cranes were coming into our minds on random mornings as we lit
into the cream centers separated by the quivering voice of a young
story just forming on our lips as the interstate closed in on the corn 
silk.

Or did I mention it?

I may have neglected to say

how much we depended on stained mattresses resting on wood
floors below walls carved with initial love as we were so careful
of the feelings that fell like splinters around our sandals handmade
from the skills passed down by grandmothers who knew leather.

Or did I tell it?

But I know I must have neglected to describe

the terrain outside the falling house filled with smoke 
and lyrics
as we viewed it through a nervous calm inspired by mums in the window
box hanging askew I was told by neighbors who crossed the street
only on odd days after the moon had run its course in their lives.

Or did you already know it?

Oh, I’m sure I neglected something

that would have helped you to know me better and live my 
life
as it was on the day the rain spoiled the mood we were building
for a decade that would end without any solidness as it transferred
the whole landscape from country to urban and back by way of the river.



In the blue shadows of night 
there is a song playing without 
sound or lyrics 
it is heard by the man with no 
ears and the woman with no 
wares in the market place 
it is a chaste song 
gone awry seeking an audience 
this is different, said a boy, 
swinging his legs to no tempo 
hanging on to each word 
that was not there 
and humming a divine tune 
of compliance

never at a loss with words 
you are speaking to black waters 
it is early and the sea spills 
reddened spikes across endless noise 
you whisper ballads to the dancing gulls 
off key and salted with aged foam 
these days you lean too heavily 
on visions of fresh dawns 
carve too many faces from the seas wall 
there is a dolphin singing godly verses 
with a ribald beat
women with existential eyes
hum lyrics you have never heard
sigh now in recognition
they have borrowed your songs
