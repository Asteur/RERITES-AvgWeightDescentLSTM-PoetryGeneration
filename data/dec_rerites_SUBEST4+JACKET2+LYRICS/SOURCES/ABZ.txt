Bone Boy
 
Toddler from 400 AD, I find you at rest
under glass in an obscure room of a small
Paris museum. Little one, what bombs
 
thundered as you slept? What queens danced
in finery? Only a mother would take care
to set your body forever straight, your lips still
 
sweet with her milk. She spread your fingers-
pale as stripped twigs─into delicate fans. Once 
they played over her face. How long before the sheer
 
casing of your skin let go? For the tendons that bound
you to shatter?  Your spine intact, thin spindle
and half a skull. On your shoulder─sad epaulet─
 
your fallen jaw. I want to scoop you
up in my hands, tiptoe past museum guards,
borders. I'll make an altar of the things you missed─
 
skateboard, soccer ball. A home for us
in the ruins of my womb.
 
 
 
 
 
Pourquoi Une Vache Rose?
 
The art teacher asks, pointing at Chagall's pink cow on a roof-
two little ones (babies? wolves?) at the teat─
 
"Strawberry milk?"
                                                (a few smirks)
 
Mademoiselle frowns, marches students on, red top knot
bobbing through galleries, white halls
           
jugglers                        bulls                
 
naked blue ladies
                        (           dawdlers dawdle)        
 
Click click shoes rushing the boys   
Dépêchez-vous─

                                               (ohohohohoh)

The Birds
 
Filming up north in BodegaBay, Alfred Hitchcock
dyed Tippi Hedren blonde, put her in a tight, lime skirt,
polished her nails pain red. His camera followed her girdled rump
through frame after frame.  She wore pickax heels. And pearls.
 
Remember the movie?
 
After the town's attacked, crows wait like thugs
on Calvary. Tippi crosses their gaze, walks as if she has an egg
balanced between her thighs. Into a dead run, she slams
inside the glass phone booth.
 
Silence. Tippi puts the phone to her ear.
 
Flap. Shadow. Shadow. Swoop,
flap─cauldron─knife wings.
Black jabbing beaks. Claws.
He promised he'd use fake birds.
 
A real gull crashes through.
Scree Scree Scree
Cheeks, skin, mouth. Ripped raw as fish.
 
Sinking, blouse torn, her bloody hand
presses the glass.
 
Hitchcock calls for take after take.
 
Tippi gets back up. At the premiere, top billing
goes to the male star. I can never remember
who he was.
 
 
 
 
 
Chance
 
Thinking a dime could hold off death,
my brother saved them in a white sock.
The first came from the floor
of a dead man's car. Keep it kid,
a cop said tossing him the coin.
My brother drove the body
to the morgue. He figured odds
were good the same dime
wouldn't be in two fatal
crashes. Thirty years later,
a doctor sees a slide of white
cells piling up like jackknifed
cars. Hospitalized, my brother
held the dime in his hand.
Our Dad and his rabbit foot
went the same way. Me?
I don't believe in luck.
Not really. Still I never pass
a lost dime without picking
it up, turning it over to see
Mercury's profile, his head
clad with silver wings.
Living Among the Dead
I expected mist or fog drifting, not this hard
Hopper light, a sun I can’t see shining
on and through.  I’d imagined the dead
living in houses, or something like houses,
imagined them having lives—loved ones,
laughter, meals to prepare.  Across the plain
I saw a high school classmate who was killed
by a grain auger.  I called his name. 
He turned, waved, walked on.  I watched
his legs scissor the ground’s slow unfurling,
wondering if he’d forgotten me,
if I’d forgotten some teenage grudge
he’d died holding.  When I caught up to him,
I asked how he was.  All right,I guess. 
The weather’s a little dry.  He nodded
toward what might have been the horizon.
Have you seen your dad? I asked.  Not yet. 
I heard he’s here somewhere.  If the dead
have ghosts, it must be the living
who haunt them.  A murdered woman called me
by her husband’s name.  I’m notthe man
who killed you, I said as gently as I could. 
I know, she said.  If the dead hunger,
it isn’t for revenge.  Like them,
I have no need to eat, though I’d like
to feel bread tearing between my teeth,
blueberries snapping open on my tongue. 
My hands hang useless on their hinges.
There’s little here that can stand our touch.

My mother waited years
to tell me: the morning after
my high school graduation,
she found her dead stepfather
eating chocolate cake in the living room. 
She said, Good morning. 
He nodded and licked blue frosting
from a plastic fork.  She knew
she was awake.  She could hear
the refrigerator’s solemn hum,
birds outside at the feeder. 
She wondered how he’d found
his way to a house built five years
after his death, wondered why
her mother hadn’t come—
but the dead deserve their rest. 
She drank a glass of water
and went back to bed. 
When she got up again,
the evidence—fork, plate, crumbs—
could’ve belonged to anyone.
 

 
The Ghosts I Want
 
If we make our dead the way we make
our lives, I choose ghosts in case
of emergency.  I know their stories:
the racecar driver who swears his dead
father’s hands closed around his ribcage
and pulled him from a flaming crash;
miners who escaped a cave-in
by following the lamp of a co-worker
they’d never met; a woman whose lifeConversations in War Time
 
On the patio of El Restaurante Jardín,
we have finished discussing
the job they will not offer me.
Talk turns to recent news:
the American woman, a lawyer, an activist,
married to a Guatemalan guerrillero, seized, missing.
She fears he’s dead, but she wants an accounting.
The governments—ours, theirs—
give her decades of dusty documents
and silence.
“What did she expect?” Diane asks,
swinging her empty beer bottle like a pendulum.
“For Christ sake, she married a guerrilla.
The army is supposed to kill him.”
“Romantic crap,” Greg snaps, spitting his disgust
into the cluster of impatiens beside him.
The tiny flowers have bright red faces,
prettier than the sunburns Diane and Greg wear.
They’ve spent their careers amid this war that isn’t theirs.
 
I’d like to say, after three years here,
I am unhardened, tender still
with reservations and respect.
A man’s life. A wife’s pain. These ought to matter.
Yet only the night before I stood with Alida on her doorstep,
a three-quarters moon above us,
 
 
as she told me how good life was in the early ’80s
when The General held absolute power.
The streets were quiet, safe.
Whoever might cause trouble couldn’t
in the far place they’d been led.
“But the impunity,” I said, “the way the army…”
She turned up her face, and her cheeks
shot back the moonlight.
Was it her beauty that cut short my words,
broke off my breath?
Men have been cowards for less.
 
Prince Charming’s Confession
 
I never thought my father would agree
to our marriage. She was, after all,
little more than a servant girl.
But he was eager, as he announced, to see me settle down,
though I think the real reason was because
he suspected my secret
and was desperate to conceal it
in the white smoke of matrimony.
I should have skipped town before my wedding day,
but I figured she, who grew up scrubbing floors,
would want what I wanted:
a top-down revolution,
pearls and porcelain to the peasants,
pitchforks in the hearts of the powdered and pampered,
and would pardon my lack of interest in producing an heir
in exchange for an equal share of power.
But when, on our honeymoon night,
I decried the proletariat’s pain,
she looked at me as if I was a talking mouse.
She cracked a smile and said,
“Come to bed, my liege,
and show me some noblesse oblige.”
I had to plead first-night jitters
and a lingering injury from a polo shot
too close to my groin.
She sulked in satin sheets
as I paced on the patio.
At last, I heard her liberating snores.
With money, it’s easy to flee.
I stopped to pick up Prince Eric
at the border,
though now he tells me he might be bi
and he kind of, sort of, sometimes misses Ariel,
despite her briny smell.
Back home, Cinderella’s turned tyrant;
her old lady’s in jail, she ordered her step-sisters guillotined.
My old man is living out his twilight in a cottage
behind the castle.
She has him over for tea on Tuesdays,
to pick his mind on affairs of state,
and while she treats him with the respect
an ex-monarch in his dotage deserves,
she can’t help but joke about his misfortune.
She told him she wouldn’t call herself queen.
She was saving the title, she said,
for me.
But what do I care?
I’m sitting by the pool, I’m drinking a daiquiri,
and here comes Lancelot,
shedding his knight’s hosiery
and giving me the eye.
You tell me: Who has the fairy tale ending?
 
Wine
 
But the news isn’t all bad.
Global warming, the Discovery Channel
informs us, makes certain wines taste better,
which means that in twenty years
we might all be vintners. And if grapes are
all we’ll be able to grow (on our roofs,
as the deluge swirls around us), well,
if you had to pick one fruit—or vegetable, even—
to live on for the rest of your life,
wouldn’t you pick the grape? All right,
so I’ll miss apples, oranges, pears, and plums.
I’ll miss carrots and cucumbers
and the occasional mouthful of spinach.
But raise your hand if you’ll mourn Brussel sprouts.
Our economy will be entirely wine-based,
with taxes paid in fluid ounces.
Drunk driving laws will have to be revised, of course.
And the drinking age will be lowered
to three.
This is a future we should celebrate:
A wine bar in every house,
every house a wine bar!
Lift your glasses, let us toast—
to wine!
And let’s drink again—
to wine!
And again—
and again!
You see: Before long, we won’t remember
what we’re missing. 
was saved by a housecall from a doctor
dead six weeks.  How much better
than guardian angels, these ghosts who love
the living too much to let them die? 
Each event ends with evidence
of impossibility: video reveals
the son’s body jerking backward,
nearly falling, as he untangles
burning legs from the steering wheel.
When rescue workers reach him,
he’s standing feet from the flames.
The miners gather on the surface,
every man accounted for except
their savior John, whose death by cave-in
is commemorated on a plaque
outside the shaft.  Fully recovered, the woman
finds the doctor’s daughter emptying
his apartment of everything except
his leather bag, unused for years.

Baptism
 
Tarsus
 
We are offerings
this time. Unwrapped
under a stone dome,
 
our glossed bodies
on heated marble,
sheets hewn by hands
 
two-thousand years ago.
Veils of steam over
lips, noses, eyes—
 
our prayers vapor
pressing an oval skylight
the width of a face.
 
Two women emerge,
mauve slips cellophane
swathing wide buttocks
 
and stomachs, brown areolas
pressed flowers. Baskets
of cloths and soap sway
 
from reddened hands.
These women wash us,
scrub with rough sponges
 
from back to ankle until
skin is pink and supple,
smooth polished stone.

Perge’s agora with art, and praise Anatolia’s cycle of holy women:
Cybele, Artemis, Mary
 
Praise the everyday women of Mersin replaced by villagers and bikinied
blondes in the English guidebook to their province, and praise the women

Praise the Air Force’s line of Ford trucks and their red-haired drivers
 
Praise students who wear wigs to college classes and once outside,
don headscarves, and praise raincoated mothers striding to market
on sunny mornings, toddlers decorating their skirts
 
Praise the sisters sitting at the fountain in Bursa’s silk bazaar, parcels

Climbing the Tallest Pine
 
The wind smells of clay
Across the surface of a thought.
If you endure
Wait for nothing.
 
The memorized trees
Could not remain.
 
It becomes only more difficult
To create a name
And hold pictures in your hand
 
Difficult to recite the facts,
To stay situated in the great dust,     
To call oneself
To race the leaves
And cry in a wide breath
 
For the first books you loved
In a function you could keep whole.
 
Where the baby vomited
Where a prayer began
It’s difficult climbing the tallest pine
Searching for an art
 
That wants to be an art,
Not a conjunction nor a prize,
Only an empty altar
Made without mercy.
 
Visited without mercy.
 
Assemblage Without Technique
 
Within the light of the needle
Hunted birds stirred into flight
Above a stretch of sand without a flag.
Bring your camera for the moment when we are lost.
The public faces age in magazines,
I just grow old on my pillow.
When the morning planets confuse my biology
I throb at the core, walking away
In the cold blue of the rain.
Carried in the silence of human muscle,
Spitting into a puddle that held the sky.
Every day there is something finished in a pattern that disappears.
A face struggles to stay inside itself,
Words held in electric marrow,
In lights flashing across a ceiling at midday
In the burning wine of the skull.
Coughing phlegm out of a noonday nap
The body is touched and born into destruction.
In vanished places of the ocean blood
I give birth to some creature
I can never see.
 
 
 
Composition in a Snowfield
 
The face bleeds and it disappears.
I close my eyes in a snowstorm.
The blade is imaginary, the blood is real.
I want to lie down, I can’t remember.
The deer pass through the ghosts of the garden
And into a vein of voices.
Lights are fading along the highway.
Now this is a territory cleared
Of guns and broken glass.
A pot of water boils in the past;
Those were my Easter eggs.
I hold them in an apron now,
Years of them now
Beneath the trees that stick to the sky.
The cranial nerves are cut from their tears
And the snow and the field are one.
Whoever cried is dying in hands that slipped away.
I want to lie down in this storm
Clutching my ladder of bones.
Above me, the cows driven home to Jesus Christ
Past the branches of the captives hanging there.
Now I am picked up and out of my red rubber boots.
I have wet myself and I drink tea
Brewed from white flowers pulled
From the dark holes of the head.
I think of nakedness and the dream I had
Of large meals by the sea,
Yellow school buses lined up in the ran.
A faceless God touching me with my own hands,
White sails made of milk and snow.
 
From the Face of a Painter’s Hour
 
Something purple bled from the face
Into a basin for my dirty hands.
In the knowing of this thing
That cannot be dispersed,
This haunted thing so endlessly hurt
In the circle of itself
Something purple dripped from the brush.
This timid and self pitying and self hating
Breather of itself in a pulse
Always ready to be quickened.
How might I hold it long enough.
I was happy walking toward heaven behind my father,
Happy to be pulled under water by God.
How well the rocks of heaven held the sleeping children,
How carefully we stepped
On our way to the sleeping place.
With purple feet small in the dark sand,
Little eyes, so many in the dark wind,
Two violinists came to watch the choosing,
Though how can we know
What is painted or not painted
Upon us.
