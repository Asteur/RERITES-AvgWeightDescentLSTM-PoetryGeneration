Her Steps are succinct and practical and

are not to be taken in any certain order. The first step for one may be the last step for another. So just take whatever steps seem easiest for you and as you take a few steps it will become easier for you to take a few more (Peace Pilgrim, 1982, p.9).

There are four preparations:

* right attitude toward life.
* bringing our lives into harmony with the laws that govern this universe.
* finding one's special place in the universe through inner guidance.
* simplification of life.

There are four purifications:

* of body
* of thoughts
* of desires
* of motivations

There are four relinquishments:

* of self-will
* of the feeling of separateness
* of all attachments
* of all negative feelings (pp.9-20)

Peace gives further advice: ""The path of gradual relinquishment...is a difficult path, for only when relinquishment is complete do the rewards really come. The path of quick relinquishments is an easy path, for it brings immediate blessings."" (p.21)

The late sixties and early seventies saw Suknaski produce work for at least ten concrete poetry chapbooks (including two anthologies) while publishing many titles by others (Dennis Lee, Stephen Scobie, bp Nichol, Earle Birney, and Sid Marty, to name a few) as well with his own Elfin Plot Press. He floated poems and magazines rolled up in Al Purdy’s cigar tubes down the North Saskatchewan River. He folded an issue of Elfin Plot into paper airplanes and had them dropped from an aircraft flying north out of Edmonton. He buried others on mountaintops, or left them on beaches melted into tablet-like candles abandoned for strangers: something to light them home. It was undoubtedly actions like these that prompted Douglas Barbour’s wry comment that Elfin Plot was “the most underground of underground magazines.” The output during this time was frenetic, sprawling, brilliant, compulsive and voluminous, especially considering his transitory lifestyle and constant poverty.

No text is sacred. Nothing is ever for real. The earth shifts beneath our feet. We are walking in circles looking again and again at the same thing.

Davis (1996, emphasis added):

""I've gradually smoothed over this more radical [ontological panpsychic] stance by strategically adopting methodological views (Arjun Appadurai and Igor Kopytoff's cultural biographies of things, Stanley Fish's reader-response theory of literary meaning) that would enable me to tell my biographical stories, and would at the same time domesticate my living objects within acceptable Western intellectual approaches. ""Biographies"" thus becomes a strategic metaphor for narrating the historical processes that surround objects over time, rather than the dead serious, non-metaphorical telling of an actual life of an embodied iconic being. Yet I don't think that means that I entirely abandon my images to Western conceptualizations. In centering the book around stories, lives of individual objects that have led and continue to lead interesting and varied lives, I hope that there is a cumulative persuasive effect that I'm not using ""lives"" metaphorically or ironically, but as the expression of a serious ontological premise. My aim is that an accomodation between two different ideas of how images might in fact be alive will emerge over the course of the book.""

In Context: U.S. Military Spending Versus Rest of the World

Consider the following:

The above sources compare the given fiscal year budget request with the latest figures for other countries, which are sometimes two years old. Still using those statistics for other countries, however, a comparison can be made here of the US Fiscal Year 2005 spending against other equivalent data:

* The US military spending was almost two-fifths of the total.
* The US military spending was almost 7 times larger than the Chinese budget, the second largest spender.
* The US military budget was almost 29 times as large as the combined spending of the six “rogue” states (Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria) who spent $14.65 billion.
* It was more than the combined spending of the next 14 nations.
* The United States and its close allies accounted for some two thirds to three-quarters of all military spending, depending on who you count as close allies (typically NATO countries, Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan and South Korea)
* The six potential “enemies,” Russia, and China together spent $139 billion, 30% of the U.S. military budget.

Some of the above statistics come from organizations such as the Center for Defense Information, and the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. They often include a global comparison. The one for Fiscal Year 2007 has been produced as a graph here:

" "On Lionel Kearns -
vispo 

He is a Linguist. Which is interesting because one of the reasons I became so excited about his work is he seems to understand that there has been a synthesis going on, over the last seventy years, more or less commencing with the work of Godel and Turing, between number and language, between mathematics and language studies, between the arts and sciences, between any pair of fields that code their material in such a way that it can be turned into information. Kearns is a language man. Kearns is a real thinker. Kearns is a media man. Kearns is a polyartist. Kearns has been contemporary since the mid sixties. I can't think of any other poets from around here except maybe bp Nichol who might have written anything in the sixties about digital poetics and issues.
" "Kali's Child 

Also relevant here is the manner in which my dialectical category of ""the erotic"" has been misread by some as flatly monodimensional, as if it meant simply ""sex,"" when in fact the erotic only begins with physical sexuality and moves out (really ""up"") from there into the sublime, ""sublimated"" realms of symbolic vision, mystical experience, mythology and theology. I could, no doubt, address such a misunderstanding in the same way that Freud answered his own critics. In an effort to show that his own concept of ""libido"" was not the ""outrageous innovation"" that people supposed it to be, the analyst called attention to how sexuality lay in an unbroken continuum with the ""higher aims"" of ""love for parents and children, friendship and love for humanity in general, and also devotion to concrete objects and to abstract ideas."" ""All these tendencies,"" Freud writes, ""are an expresson of the same instinctual impulses.""13 Then, as if to move even higher ""up"" along the continuum, Freud invokes--appropriately, I would argue--the erotic mysticism of Plato and the love theology of Paul: ""In its origin, function, and relation to sexual love,"" he wrote, ""the 'Eros' of the philosopher Plato coincides exactly with the love-force, the libido of psycho-analysis . . . and when the apostle Paul, in his famous epistle to the Corinthians, praises love above all else, he certainly understands it in the same 'wider' sense.""14
" "adi da
AVATAR ADI DA SAMRAJ: There is a fundamental fear of being without a world. You are constantly servicing the impulse to always have a world and also to have that world be basically comfortable.

That impulse underlies all forms of ""cosmic religion"" — or the religion of preserving beings in the cosmic domain, of granting everybody a world and making the world more and more congenial by at least getting rid of darker influences.

The ""Perfect Practice"" of the Way of Adidam, however, is not about ""having a world"". It is about entering into the Domain That Is Prior to the cosmic domain.

People generally do not have the disposition for such a practice. As long as there is identification with the body-mind, you do not want there to be no world. In fact, you insist that there be a world — and that it be congenial to you. Therefore, you will not relinquish your world.

In other words, you will not accept the Position you are actually in, the Position That Transcends the conditional (or cosmic) domain, until your craven attachment to the body-mind (and, therefore, to having a world that is congenial) relaxes profoundly, such that you know the world for what it is and (thereby) realize a native detachment.

Then the ""Perfect Practice"" can begin.

Words Made Flesh
WORDS MADE FLESH
Code, Culture, Imagination
Florian Cramer

A b s t r a c t: Executable code existed centuries before the invention of the computer in magic, Kabbalah, musical composition and experimental poetry. These practices are often neglected as a historical pretext of contemporary software culture and electronic arts. Above all, they link computations to a vast speculative imagination that encompasses art, language, technology, philosophy and religion. These speculations in turn inscribe themselves into the technology. Since even the most simple formalism requires symbols with which it can be expressed, and symbols have cultural connotations, any code is loaded with meaning. This booklet writes a small cultural history of imaginative computation, reconstructing both the obsessive persistence and contradictory mutations of the phantasm that symbols turn physical, and words are made flesh.

Autopoesis 

Autopoesis

Autopoesis is both a concept about self-maintaining systems, especially biological ones, and an epistemological theory about cognition and self-reference.

Humberto Maturana and F. J. Varela proposed the concept of autopoesis (as opposed to allopoetic) as the organization of living things, which maintains their lasting unity and wholeness in the midst of continual turnover of constituents, specifically through self-production. For them, autopoesis is the necessary and sufficient condition for the minimal units of life. Autopoesis defines the minimal mechanistic features of the simplest possible living entity. It describes ""how life works."" All living systems are autopoetic, and all physical systems, if autopoetic, can be said to be living.

In fact, growing at a modest rate of 1% per year, Kardashev estimated that it would take only 3,200 years to reach Type II status, and 5,800 years to reach Type III status.

For example, a Type I civilization is a truly planetary one, which has mastered most forms of planetary energy. Their energy output may be on the order of thousands to millions of times our current planetary output.

It looks like a four-armed starfish, but so far it's unaware of its own shape. After flailing its arms for a while, however, the robot gets a sense of its design and begins to walk. The real feat comes when engineers remove a part of its leg: The robot senses a change in its structure and begins walking in a different way to compensate. The demonstration is the first proof that a robot can generate a conception of itself and then adapt to damage, a handy skill to have in unpredictable environments.

It is composed not of units but of dimensions, or rather directions in motion. It has neither beginning nor end, but always a milieu from which it grows and which it overspills...

Remote Control Device 'Controls' Humans 

Nippon Telegraph Telephone Corp., Japans top telephone company, says it is developing the technology to perhaps make video games more realistic. But more sinister applications also come to mind.

I can envision it being added to militaries' arsenals of so-called ""non-lethal"" weapons.

A special headset was placed on my cranium by my hosts during a recent demonstration at an NTT research center. It sent a very low voltage electric current from the back of my ears through my head _ either from left to right or right to left, depending on which way the joystick on a remote-control was moved.

I found the experience unnerving and exhausting: I sought to step straight ahead but kept careening from side to side. Those alternating currents literally threw me off.

The technology is called galvanic vestibular stimulation _ essentially, electricity messes with the delicate nerves inside the ear that help maintain balance.

epigenetics --Endocrinology (Journal) 

""Transient exposure of a gestating female rat during the period of sex determination to the endocrine disruptor vinclozolin (ie anti-androgenic endocrine disruptor used as a fungicide in the fruit industry) induced an adult phenotype in the first F1 generation of breast tumors, prostate disease, kidney disease, immune abnormalities and premature aging. These adult onset diseases were transferred through the male germ-line to 85% of all males of all subsequent generations examined (ie F1-F4). "" 

In other words, pollution's effects on the body can be inherited. It's called epigenetics.

""...with Leibniz the question surges forth in philosophy that will continue to haunt Whitehead and Bergson: not how to attain eternity, but in what conditions does the objective world allow for a subjective production of novelty, that is, of creation? The best of all worlds had no other meaning: it was neither the least abominable nor the least ugly, but the one whose All granted a production of novelty, a liberation of true quanta of ""private"" subjectivity, even at the cost of the removal of the damned. The best of all worlds is not the one that reproduces the eternal, but the one in which new creations are produced, the one endowed with a capacity for innovation or creativity: a teleological conversion of philosophy.""

"" The winter Bodélé dust is carried over the populated regions of west Africa where it can be affected by smoke and urban pollution before it continues transport over the Atlantic and towards Amazonia. Although Koren et al do not speculate on the chemical possibilities in their paper, the interaction between the dust and the pollutants provides opportunity for acids to coat the dust particles and to mobilize the iron compounds, creating a highly efficient fertilizing agent for ocean phytoplankton and the biota of the Amazon forest. Koren et al do quantify the dust emission of the Bodélé depression, estimating that this small area produces approximately 50% of the Saharan dust deposited in the Amazon.""

Th Illusion of Conscious Will 

Daniel Wegner: ""How do people come to understand their actions as their own? Common sense tells us we know when actions are ours because we have caused them; we are intrinsically informed of what we do by our conscious will. But it turns out people can be mistaken about their own authorship....people will feel they are the source of action when they think about that action in advance of its occurrence, and alternative sources of the action are not known. This theory calls into question the common sense view that conscious will is the cause of action.""

(Pores 4) 

How and why do the ways of reading poetry in the UK that are most publicly visible still exclude work that is aesthetically and linguistically radical? What is the history of these models of reading poetry, and what is their relationship to marketing? What are the key sites of influence and how do they work (as cultural practices and as forms of power)? Why have recent moves, for example in Poetry Review, to give some recognition to the range of British poetries aroused such hostile responses? What is at stake? What are the possibilities for real change? What types of writing and publishing are offering alternative economies of reading to those that postmodern capitalism benefits from?

many people play over 40 hours a week -
and when people play, they help label images on the Web with descriptive keywords. These keywords can be used to significantly improve the accuracy of image search. People play the game not because they want to help, but because they enjoy it.

I describe other examples of ""games with a purpose"": Peekaboom, which helps determine the location of objects in images, and Verbosity, which collects common-sense knowledge. I also explain a general approach for constructing games with a purpose.

One of the outstanding features of civilization is the antagonism that develops between what comes to be called science and art. The former term literally means ""knowledge""; the latter, ""a way of doing things.""

If wisdom is the union of these two, their separation implies a loss of meaning,
a fall into absurdity.

""Design techniques for static information are well understood, their descriptions and discourse thorough and well-evolved. But these techniques fail when dynamic information is considered. There is a space of highly complex systems for which we lack deep understanding because few techniques exist for visualization of data whose structure and content are continually changing. To approach these problems, this thesis introduces a visualization process titled Organic Information Design. The resulting systems employ simulated organic properties in an interactive, visually refined environment to glean qualitative facts from large bodies of quantitative data generated by dynamic information sources.""

""Oliver Sacks observed autistic twins who instantly guessed the exact number of matchsticks that had just fallen on the floor, saying in unison “111”. To test the suggestion that normal individuals have the capacity for savant numerosity, we temporarily simulated the savant condition in normal people by inhibiting the left anterior temporal lobe of twelve participants with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). This site has been implicated in the savant condition. Ten participants improved their ability to accurately guess the number of discrete items immediately following rTMS and, of these, eight became worse at guessing as the effects of the pulses receded. The probability of as many as eight out of twelve people doing best just after rTMS and not after sham stimulation by chance alone is less than one in one thousand.""

""The idea of notation implies, if not demands, performance. Virtually any form of writing is a kind of notation and any form of reading is a type of performance. Poetry is an intensely physical art, one that activates several senses at once. In aural societies poetry has traditionally been accompanied by facial movement, gesture, manipulation of symbolic objects, the drawing and painting of figures, the wearing of costumes, etc. -
all of which, in a tribal context, are read. Poetry still is a physical art using multiple senses: the body as a whole equals or sometimes replaces the voice in performance art, and even silent readers turn pages, move their heads, their eyes, the roots of their tongues if not their tongues and lips, and so forth.""

Laws of Media defines a general theory of media change, constructing a tetrad model with four characteristics of media-in-transition: extension, obsolescence, reversal and retrieval.""

Culture and the Individual 
Thanks to language and culture, human behavior can be incomparably more intelligent, more original, creative and flexible than the behavior of animals, whose brains are too small to accommodate the number of neurons necessary for the invention of language and the transmission of accumulated knowledge. But, thanks again to language and culture, human beings often behave with a stupidity, a lack of realism, a total inappropriateness, of which animals are incapable.[Aldous Huxley.

transmediale.07 / Keynote: Stelarc 
An ear has been surgically constructed on his arm. The intention with this soft prosthesis is to wirelessly connect it to the internet to enable it to become a listening device for remote others. Stelarc considers the ear prosthesis not as a sign of physical malfunction, but rather as a symbol for an additional feature 
not a sign of loss but rather a symptom of excess. Thus he tries to amplify the forms and functions of the human body, exposing its obsolescence and producing a human-machine-hybrid which questions the notion of the architecture, engineering and operation of the human body.

There are many similarities. Poems organize themselves. The writer submits words to the embryonic arrangement of the poem — a phrase, a conjectured verse form, intellectual argument, controlling emotion — but thereafter the poem takes over, creating an arrangement of words that is not easily changed. Poets often produce cycle of poems, recognizable in theme and form, but differing slightly from poem to poem. Literary periods also see these cycles of creation: a common technique or subject matter or Zeitgeist. Strange attractors have exactly these properties: similarities but not repetitions, an independence, a reluctance to shift far from their previous shape and position.""

""MAKING PROFOUND ART"" by Andrew Wielawski 
These were the words of the Dreamer, who told me that the future doesn’t exist, because it hasn’t happened yet, and the past is gone. The world as we know it doesn’t exist, either, because it is only our own projection of chemical electrical impulses onto the screen of our brains. It is not the events as they happened, only a time delayed and heavily filtered rendition of them.

With a philosophical view like this, it is only a matter of taking things one step further to see how much freedom we have through our art.

How to Write a Scientific Paper 

Abstract

We (meaning I) present observations on the scientific publishing process

which (meaning that) are important and timely in that unless I have more

published papers soon, I will never get another job. These observations

are consistent with the theory that it is difficult to do good science, write

good scientific papers, and have enough publications to get future jobs.

Algorithmic Improvisations on the 74 Unique Words of Gadji Beri Bimba
" " Friends of Orbit Bright – a racistly-white parody site promoting chewing gum and chastity (sex!). Painfully obvious perpetual brand placements. It's aimed at (post-)tweeners who believe in god but want to get laid. Outlook Theatre – a car made glamorous through association with video vignettes of a perfect family and immaculate romantic moments. Light fluffy and efficient consumer waltz. It's aimed at the wife archetype who wishes she could drive away. UFC66 – an Ultra fighting championship labyrinth full of snarling warriors and big time money. It's aimed at soldiers, the dispossessed and anyone who needs to fight just to survive. The myth of a champion is needed only by the defeated and oppressed." "

" "" "Conjecture : Information-Sucking Reflex
""Alongside the innate physical sucking reflex for obtaining milk to be digested, decomposed and used all over the body for growth, repair, and energy, there is a genetically determined information-sucking reflex, which seeks out, sucks in, and decomposes information, which is later recombined in many ways, growing the information-processing architecture and many diverse recombinable competences. Our educational system and other factors (e.g. mind-binding cultures) often interfere with this process, unfortunately.
A big mistake made by governments and educational theorists is to assume that there's a right order in which to grow the architecture, etc. A system building a complex structure may have to assemble different substructures in a sequence that is opportunistic and ideosyncratic. Educational systems that do not allow for this can do a lot of damage through excessive regimentation, e.g. based on use of 'targets'. ""

The dashboard of my Toyota Camry, for example, is covered by vinyl molded to simulate stitching; the simulated stitching alludes back to a fabric that was in fact stitched, although it no longer serves that function in my car. Skeuomorphs visibly testify to the social or psychological necessity for innovation to be tempered by replication.

""Much of the novel's alleged power is embedded in the line, that compulsory author-directed movement from the beginning of a sentence to its period, from the top of the page to the bottom, from the first page to the last. Of course, through print's long history, there have been countless strategies to counter the line's power, from marginalia and footnotes to the creative innovations of novelists like Laurence Sterne, James Joyce, Raymond Queneau, Julio Cortazar, Italo Calvino and Milorad Pavic, not to exclude the form's father, Cervantes himself. But true freedom from the tyranny of the line is perceived as only really possible now at last with the advent of hypertext, written and read on the computer, where the line in fact does not exist unless one invents and implants it in the text.""

Born in 1870 in Brno, Moravia, his stonemason father died when he was only nine. A rebellious, disorientated boy, he failed in various attempts to get through architecture school. Contracting syphilis in the brothels of Vienna, by 21 he was sterile and in 1893 his mother disowned him. He went to America and for three years and did odd jobs in New York, somehow finding himself in that process and returning to Vienna in 1896 a man of taste and intellectual refinement, immediately entering the fashionable Viennese intelligentsia. His friends included Ludwig Wittgenstein, Arnold Schönberg, and Karl Kraus. He quickly established himself as the preferred architect of Vienna’s cultured bourgeoisie. Diagnosed with cancer in 1918, his stomach, appendix and part of his intestine were removed. For the rest of his life he could only digest ham and cream. He had several unhappy marriages. By the time he was fifty he was almost completely deaf; in 1928 he was disgraced by a paedophilia scandal and at his death in 1933 at 63 he was penniless[2]. He died in Kalksburg near Vienna.

Featuring works that transform books through a variety of mediums, Book/Shelf stresses an expanded notion of the illustrated book. The exhibition begins with a documentation of Marcel Duchamp's Unhappy Readymade (1919)—a work created when the artist, while traveling, asked his sister back home to hang a geometry book on his balcony in order to let the wind flip and tear the pages. It continues with works in which artists appropriate books by others, such as a sculpture by Martin Kippenberger made partly of books, and a copy of Duchamp's catalogue raisonné rebound by David Hammons under the title Holy Bible. Artists who tackle the idea of books in film (William Wegman), sound works (On Kawara), prints (Edward Ruscha), and drawings (Steve Wolfe) are represented as well. Finally, the exhibition surveys a number of artists who have created installations that display books in public contexts, including Brian Belott, Allen Ruppersberg, Josh Smith, and Lawrence Weiner.

This new age, they explain, is defined both by the heating trend (whose closest analogue may be the catastrophe known as the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum, 56 million years ago) and by the radical instability expected of future environments. In somber prose, they warn that ""the combination of extinctions, global species migrations and the widespread replacement of natural vegetation with agricultural monocultures is producing a distinctive contemporary biostratigraphic signal. These effects are permanent, as future evolution will take place from surviving (and frequently anthropogenically relocated) stocks."" Evolution itself, in other words, has been forced into a new trajectory.

That grisly thing, a “poetry reading”, is what it is because there will always be some among the audience who are bored or all but frankly hostile and who can’t remove themselves by the simple act of turning a knob. And it is at bottom the same difficulty—the fact that a theatre audience is not a selected one—that makes it impossible to get a decent performance of Shakespeare in England. On the air these conditions do not exist. The poet FEELS that he is addressing people to whom poetry means something, and it is a fact that poets who are used to broadcasting can read into the microphone with a virtuosity they would not equal if they had a visible audience in front of them. The element of make-believe that enters here does not greatly matter. The point is that in the only way now possible the poet has been brought into a situation in which reading verse aloud seems a natural unembarrassing thing, a normal exchange between man and man: also he has been led to think of his work as SOUND rather than as a pattern on paper. By that much the reconciliation between poetry and the common man is nearer. It already exists at the poet’s end of the aether-waves, whatever may be happening at the other end.

Poetry interests me above all as a kind of resistence. In the first place because its economy is absolutely aberrant to contemporary logic: an enormous investment (in terms of time and energy), quasi-nil effect and zero profitability. So it’s an act that could only be directed by internal necessity...

In the last decades of the 20th century many writers have been interested in the expressional possibilities offered by the democratization of the moving image, especially by the video media. One result from this is the video poetry developed, among others, by E.M. Melo e Castro, Richard Kostelanetz and Arnaldo Antunes from the 60’s onwards. If one were to trace a thorough history of the virtual textual motion, the tradition of video and multimedia poetry should be taken into consideration. On the other hand, it could also be fruitful to examine how video artists have experimented with the so-called natural language and linguistic articulation. Here I’m thinking especially of Gary Hill

Screening Room was a 1970s Boston television series that for almost ten years offered independent filmmakers a chance to show and discuss their work on a commercial (ABC-TV) affiliate station. The series was developed and hosted by filmmaker Robert Gardner (Dead Birds, Forest of Bliss), who was Chairman of the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies and Director of the Carpenter Center for Visual Arts at Harvard for many years. This unique program dealt even-handedly with animation, documentary, and experimental film, welcoming such artists as Jan Lenica, John and Faith Hubley, Emile DeAntonio, Jean Rouch, Ricky Leacock, Jonas Mekas, Bruce Baillie, Yvonne Rainer and Michael Snow. Frequently, guests such as Octavio Paz, Stanley Cavell, and Rudolph Arnheim appeared as well. The filmmakers presented on the show are now considered the most influential contributors to modern experimental film, documentary, and animation.

Our situation is this: most of the people in this world believe that the Creator of the universe has written a book. We have the misfortune of having many such books on hand, each making an exclusive claim as to its infallibility. People tend to organize themselves into factions according to which of these incompatible claims they accept rather than on the basis of language, skin color, location of birth, or any other criterion of tribalism. Each of these texts urges its readers to adopt a variety of beliefs and practices, some of which are benign, many of which are not. All are in perverse agreement on one point of fundamental importance, however: respect for other faiths, or for the views of unbelievers, is not an attitude that God endorses.

""...our aim lies in developing simple, deterministic and traceable generative processes. These simple processes have the advantage of more control: as they are highly determinable, their output is predictable and can therefore be easily refined through subsequent adjustments. We aim to show that a single deterministic process can generate a heterogeneous set of forms with an astounding degree of complexity.""

Gnoetry synthesizes language randomly based on its analysis of existing texts. Any machine-readable text or texts, in any language, can serve as the basis of the Gnoetic process. Gnoetry generates sentences that mimic the local statistical properties of the source texts. This language is filtered subject to additional constraints (syllable counts, rhyming, etc.) to produce a poem.

[...]

A key aspect of the Gnoetry software is the ability of a human operator to intervene in the language generation cycle, helping to “guide” the artistic process and to produce a result that is a true collaboration of equals.""

It also leads to a distracted kind of reading in which (compared to print)  information is not processed as fully, remembered as long, or integrated as much into one's existing mental schemas (held in long term memory). ...  evidence suggests that the low-level activities of Web reading (clicking links, navigating websites, etc.), small as they are, nevertheless increase the cognitive load and therefore decrease the effectiveness with which information can be processed.

""In this paper we identify the homeland of the Indo-European language family by adapting ‘phylogeographic’ methods initially developed by epidemiologists to trace the origins of virus outbreaks. Instead of comparing viruses, we compare languages and instead of DNA, we look for shared cognates – words that have a common origin, such as “mother,” “mutter” and “madre” – across various Indo-European languages. We use the cognates to infer a family tree of the languages and, together with information about the location of each language, we trace back through time to infer the location at the root of the tree – the origin of Indo-European.""

Origin: Anatolia Plateau
Anatolia (from Greek Ἀνατολή Anatolē — ""east"" or ""(sun)rise""; also Asia Minor, from Greek: Μικρὰ Ἀσία Mikrá Asía ""small Asia""; in modern Turkish: Anadolu) is a geographic and historical term denoting the westernmost protrusion of Asia, comprising the majority of the Republic of Turkey.

This piece was created by scanning electron microscopy. The lines of the gradually self-reducing anagram poem were printed on a semiconductor device sample of Germanium and Silicon dioxide. The lines of the poem were written by a focus Ga ion beam into the sample. Placed into the microscope, the sequences of images were scanned by electrons at ranges from 400x all the way to 10000x. The first line was taken from the manual of the focused ion beam imaging system.

Teaching in the Margins: Michael Joyce 
Full Stop

""In conferences and class salons (the term I’ve taken to using, rather than workshops, for writing classes) I often perplex students by asking of a poem or a piece of fiction of theirs, “What do you want it to do?” At first this is confusing (voila succès!) and they tend to respond in terms of meanings, motifs, internal rhythms and the like, against which I push back, insisting that, if writing is to be anything, it must first be an action in this world. This is a standard I hold myself to as well, and which in my writing I most often fail to meet, finding dark consolation in Beckett’s “Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.”""

AKASHA ( [aːkaːʃə], आकाश) has roots in Sanskrit and means “ether” in both its elemental and metaphysical senses.

The ancient Sanskrit-speaking civilization envisioned akasha as a metaphysical information network connecting humanity with itself and infinite knowledge. In this paradigm, thoughts, ideas, feelings, and experiences are stored forever and shared through the ether, which acts as an universal field connecting multiple planes of existence.

Thousands of years later we have created a modern information network openly connecting humans with each other and perpetual knowledge.

Tangle removes the tension and cost of miners that plague Bitcoin and, as it looks to scale, Ethereum.

Proof-of-Stake … doesn’t require miners to do useless math in a race to solve a block.

I was reading the code of the June 23rd announcement of MultiModel Learning Across Domains (code) (blog) when (in that classic post-attention hyper-shifting net-mode) an article on Bancor Unchained: All Your Token Are Belong To Us somehow appeared to warn me:

“The only thing that matters is what’s in the code.”
Bancor Unchained highlights the fact that the smart contract is executed by compiled code, not ideas or promises. The features announced by an ICO, and the nuanced philosophical or theoretical whitepapers (pdf) that precede or accompany an ICO ( these mysterious mania-driven events) might not be fully reflected in the pragmatic reality of what the code (which is at its core the smart contract; the smarts of it being nothing more than the tedious encrypted tension of encapsulated processes reiterating) can do.

Reading the the Bancor code does not offer a glimpse of a theoretical paradigm leap in programming structure: the code begins with ‘pragma’ and ‘import’ statements (also found in Swift, Java, Python, Haskell, Go, Scala, Objective C etc…). It uses syntax historically indiscernible from other code.

In other words, as the lawyers are swept out and dissolve in a swarm of irrelevancies, a new tide carries in programmers, who distill and implement the ideals of politicals, who have imbibed on philosophies of deterritorialized egalitarianism, who have perhaps had a poetic epiphany or vision of another world. At each juncture of that flow, the idealistic impulse mutates, descending, concretized susceptible to selfishness.

Prepare for a new breed of power: the code-lawyer, a synthesis of programmer, lawyer and contractual negotiator. Prepare for gender bias in the tech and law world to continue. The law-ICO-programmer becomes the final interpreter who implements the subtle fine print, backdoors, and grift. Code is the new fine print:

“the large print giveth and the small print taketh away”
As David Graeber outlines in Debt, the Axial Age (from 8th-3rd BCE, which the existential philosopher Karl Jaspers identified as the birth zone of philosophy in India, China, Greece and Mesopotamia) was also the period when money and organized armies of mercenaries were born. These shifts consolidated numerous extraordinary transitions in culture and thought. Yet they did not change core hierarchical tribal territorial patterns of acquisitiveness.

We are in the midst of another Axial Age. Cryptocurrencies will eradicate paper currency. Smart contracts and blockchains are the foundations of new forms of business and community. Yet until the instincts of humanity mutate, basic inequity will persist.


For the classroom, the watchwords are agility, openness, and consensus: identify what needs to be learned, distribute the load among the students eager and able to do it, agree on their roles, responsibilities, and rewards, and then codify these rights in smart contracts.”

Ok it may be an over-statement, but i am pretty annoyed.

On Tuesday July 4th I purchased a Google Daydream headset. The cashier informed me at checkout it was unreturnable if the box was opened. No worries: it only cost 100$ and I intended to keep it, to bring it to University of Bergen in Norway for a VR seminar and use it as a cheap comfortable untethered VR viewing device for some demos I had made.

Daydream is designed specifically for the Google Pixel phone. I had bought the Pixel because I like vanilla stock Android (I like it so much I previously owned a Nexus and a Nexus 6P). An OS apparently without any corporate cruft. Yet I was about to learn how the internet of things circumvents apparent transparency. Daydream would become a nightmare.

That afternoon I slotted my phone into the Daydream device with a demo I’d made using Mozilla’s A-Frame, a lightweight webvr toolkit (based on the JavaScript library for 3D manipulation called Three.js). A-Frame allows for quick deployment of VR in a browser.

Sweet. Wonderful. It worked. I spent the afternoon developing and that evening cycled over to a friend who works as a knowledge broker at Concordia University. Sitting in his backyard under the trees, he experienced 3 of my webvr demos using the Daydream headset. I was pleased. Situation normal. The headset was easy to open and close, the head strap comfortable, the viewing quality reasonable. I was happy with my purchase.

On Tuesday July 5th, I decided to test out a VR work made specifically for the Daydream headset (made by folks I know, Samantha Gorman and Danny Cannizzaro from Tender Claws) called Virtual Virtual Reality.

Virtual Virtual Reality proved to be exquisitely interesting, clever, professional, well-written and engaging. A joy to experience. Intimidatingly proficient. Ironically subversive.

I was enthralled. On June 29th, A-Frame announced link traversals that included support for the Daydream controller. I was looking forward to playing around, creating some quick demos.

But that’s when the trouble began. Pairing the controller and installing the dedicated Daydream app eradicated the capacity to use webvr demos I had hosted on my site, even the ones I had previously viewed in the headset. When I loaded my browser demos and put my Pixel into the headset, it now auto launched a pairing process, then switched to the Daydream app.

No biggie. I figured I just had to reset it somehow. Check app settings. Nothing. Enable flags for webvr and gamepad api in Chrome. Restart. Unsolved. Hmm. Uninstall Daydream. Restart. Put phone in headset, Android now prompted me to install Daydream. Uh-to.

The Origins Trail

Now I began to sweat. Search for a solution led to the PlayCanvas website, a platform tool for creating VR (initiated by Google, it costs $15 per month to have any export capacity). And the Origins Trails process where Google sanctioned select key developers to use this experimental webvr functionality inside their headset (“Implement a framework for exposing experimental features in the browser, but only to specific/registered origins, for limited duration and subject to global usage caps”). The rationale for this from a dev perspective is presented here.

Bottom line (as i understand it): only webvr projects sanctioned by Google work within the Daydream headset. It’s as if you bought a radio or a TV set that would only play channels approved by the manufacturer. What’s happened to the freedom of the web? Is content equivalent to an app? The headset is just a set of lens.

The Internet of Silos.

So I made a painful decision, I reset my Pixel phone to factory defaults. I was hoping to return to that evening in my friend’s backyard under the trees, using Daydream as a comfortable untethered lightweight webvr viewing utility, forget about the controller. The purity of Android could not fail me. Yet it did. Placing the reset-to-factory-default phone in the headset, immediately triggered the same irreversible context switch: “Daydream install required. In order to play… Please update.”

There are two levels of resetting Android. I had done the soft reset. So I tried to do the hard reset. It failed. Brainless brick.

Corporate Curated Consciousness

Result: I slowly realized that if I enable the webvr flags in chrome, it cannot view webvr stereoscopically hosted on my site: thus even Cardboard is worthless for demos. With webvr flags enabled, the stereoscopic launch button no longer works unless I visit google-approved webvr. Nightly Firefox does not function in stereoscopic any more: why? Who knows.

I am stranded with a corporate headset that curates content, jealously guarding its portal. Radical infantilism. Reality reloaded with a subset of Reality controlled by geeks and brand marketers. Ironically it echoes the storyline of the Virtual Virtual Reality project where VR headsets defined by corporate ideology define reality.

How? My suspicion is the headset after the first launch of the Daydream app passively inserted the Bluetooth ID of my phone into an on-device storage array. The headset now knows my phone. It does not care about its OS or factory reset.

Android bypassed. Lock initialized. Object to object. Thing to thing silo.

Unremovable solitude. Implacable logos.

Google famous motto is “Don’t be Evil”. Hannah Arendt famously noted the banality of evil. In a future where information/ideologies/culture become branded battlefields, constraints on consciousness will arise. A decision made to increase brand loyalty today can sprout future tyranny. The world is not without auspicious examples: from the Great Firewall of China to the bunkered intelligence services of all great nations, control proliferates to apparently protect. Insidious bureaucracies slide into authoritarianism.

Jealousy is one of the deepest instincts of the psyche. The song of Solomon speaks of the bitter fire that burns thereof as worse than the taste of death. Ownership‘s primordial glandular fury flexes it’s muscles. Sculpting opportunities within commodities into contemporary shackles.

Banal evil arises when interface design succumbs to corporate imperatives.

Brand chastity.

Interoperability issues, incompatible formats, silos. It’s not new.

Instagram, Snapchat, Uber, Maps: gated. Share something from Evernote on a phone, and it’s impossible to leave the silo. Load a webpage or video through Facebook and it’s lovingly wrapped in their very own branding, links and data mining sauce. All brands do it. The larger the corporation, the more likely you can never leave it’s boundaries and that the border will be guarded and exact a fee of time. The banality of evil.

It has become a truism to recognize that corporations grasp at usage data. It’s normative tedium, cages masquerading as loyalty bonus.

My favorite company to critique in this regard is Apple. I have a MacBook Air,. I love it. It is a wonderful rugged piece of technology, an agile jeep sliding over code surfaces. But the Apple urge to encapsulate consumer self often feels manipulative, click bait designed to prevent miscegenation with other devices. iTunes is border control. Back at headquarters they want you to live and die within the Apple ecosystem.

Unfortunately I use 5 computers with 4 operating systems: OSX, Windows, Linux, and Android. My life is a field of numb juggling. Squabbling kids. My suspicion is that when a corporation combines software and hardware, the silo grows a wormhole into brand gravity.

VR as PR

This is a story of how I prepared for a VR seminar and how a single hardware purchase resulted in a mild yet annoying software blockade. And how this blockade implies something latent deeper and more pernicious: the potential for corporate decisions to influence self through VR MR AR.

In an ecosystem of informational overlays, when interfaces reflect decisions made for profit, and brand loyalty triumphs over transparency, then culture-silos imply ownership of people. Mind-control is imminent. Google Daydream represents a dangerous precedent for propaganda

We evolved a tRNA adenosine deaminase to operate on DNA when fused to a catalytically impaired CRISPR-Cas9. Extensive directed evolution and protein engineering resulted in seventh-generation ABEs (e.g., ABE7.10), that convert target A•T to G•C base pairs efficiently (~50% in human cells) with very high product purity (typically ≥ 99.9%) and very low rates of indels (typically ≤ 0.1%).”

The clinical assessment of suicidal risk would be substantially complemented by a biologically based measure that assesses alterations in the neural representations of concepts related to death and life in people who engage in suicidal ideation. This study used machine-learning algorithms (Gaussian Naive Bayes) to identify such individuals (17 suicidal ideators versus 17 controls) with high (91%) accuracy, based on their altered functional magnetic resonance imaging neural signatures of death-related and life-related concepts. The most discriminating concepts were ‘death’, ‘cruelty’, ‘trouble’, ‘carefree’, ‘good’ and ‘praise’.”

We will learn to need strategy, they say. But we know strategy is the delivery system for a concept, collateral and deployed. Indeed, strategy is itself just a concept in the world, the universal approach. But not even capital cares. Capital only wants things to run smoothly, which is to say universally. This is what disruption is for, and leadership, and open innovation. Capital does not fear strategy. It can barely remember it from the days of worldly concepts.”

Conclusions: Injury to a small region in the pontine tegmentum is significantly associated with coma. This brainstem site is functionally connected to 2 cortical regions, the AI and pACC, which become disconnected in disorders of consciousness. This network of brain regions may have a role in the maintenance of human consciousness.”

The promise of this technology mostly lies in its sustainability. Water can be pulled from the air without any energy input beyond that which can be collected from the ambient sunlight. In addition, MOF-801 is a zirconium-based compound that is widely available for a low cost. And the technology has a long-life span: Yaghi predicts that the MOF will last through at least 100,000 cycles of water absorption and desorption, and thus it does not require frequent replacement. Plus, the water harvesting technology employing MOF isn’t limited to drinking water.”

when we encounter an acute perceived threat – a large, menacing dog, for example – the hypothalamus, at the base of our brain, sets off an alarm system in our body, sending chemical signals to the pituitary gland. The pituitary, in turn, releases ACTH (Adrenocorticotropic hormone) that activates our adrenal glands, next to our kidneys, to release adrenalin and the primary stress hormone, cortisol.”

the cells incorporated two unnatural amino acids (called PrK and pAzF) into a protein that emits a soft, green glow. Both the foreign bases and amino acids were fed to the cells, and any organism that somehow escaped the lab would not be able to produce them. To allow the cells to use these new components, the researchers created modified versions of molecules called tRNAs, which function to read codons and ferry the appropriate amino acids to the cells’ protein factories — ribosomes.”
