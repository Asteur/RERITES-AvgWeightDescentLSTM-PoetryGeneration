A series of white squares, each
an hour's flying time, each with instructions
in pencil: the organized adventure....a crowd of Javanese walking up a volcanic mountain.
They laugh and talk, they carry baskets
and various loads on poles....The plane staggers with the weight of fuel,
becomes lighter and then
light. The last square has
an island in it, but cannot
lead her there.Under a microscope there are lights in a leaf
that flicker and go out, as the leaf dies.She wonders what holds her life together.
Not herself; she too is held.
Something does it like daylight through
a glass of water.Trying to get my head out of the way
without moving my eyes
was an occupation that gave me numerous headaches
and glasses before I was five. Older philosophers
have gotten worse results
from similar exercises.One thing the mothers and sisters and teachers
		were careful not to mention
		but that grandmothers boldly engaged in
		as if it didn't matter what anybody said,

		was dying, walking into
		the empty mirror just out of sight,
		darkening to a silhouette in which someone else
		appears, someone familiar --            an imitation grain,
		small strokes and walnut swirls,
		intricate as weather patterns
		in a satellite's eye              the imagined person, the one
		made with small strokes
		on this paper
		that used to be trees.		IV.
		Ivy that is.
		Had you forgotten.
		X.A stone jar smoothes with use. Useful.
An open door is empty.They raise honey bees as well in the alcove,
		the oldest part of the wall.
		Their will is very old. They and we
		arrange straw for the bees in niches some of which are
		occupied also by stone saints.
		The bees are particular since
		the straw creates their cloisters. Finally we forget what we are carrying and do not
		make mistakes.
A series of white squares, each
an hour's flying time, each with instructions
in pencil: the organized adventure. "Carelessness
offends the spirit of Ulysses." She suspends herself,
as he did, in the elements, finds
reason turns to motion, caution to design.
"One ocean led naturally to
another." Earth led naturally to sky
after a look at a thing of wood and wire
at the state fiar in Des Moines, after the sting
of snow blown from the skis of training planes
near Philadelphia.
                                                    The rumble of the red and gold
Electra wakes the air, shakes stars
down their strings until
they hang outside the cockpit, close enough
to touch. Squares, like quickened days, take turns
showing her senses

what to do. The fragrance of blooming
orange orchards carries to considerable
altitudes. "No one has seen a tree
who has not seen it from the air, with
its shadow." Lake Chad is huge, shallow,
brightened by the wings of cranes and maribou
storks. The Red Sea is blue; the White and Blue Niles,
green; the Amazon delta a party of currents,
brown and yellow, distinct. Beyond

the clutter of sensations, the shriek and clatter
of tools at landing fields, she renews
herself, like the engine, for
one thing. Flight
above the wine-dark shining flood
is order, makes the squares
come and go, makes the plane
a tiny gear that turns the world. "Of all those things
external to the task at hand, we clutch
what we can."
                                          She leaves the plane briefly to join
a crowd of Javanes walking up a volcanic mountain.
They laugh and talk, they carry baskets
and various loads on poles. "Sometime
I hope to stay somewhere as long as I like." For

the last long passage she abandons personal items,
souvenirs; also the parachute, useless over the Pacific.
The plane staggers with the weight of fuel,
becomes lighter and then
light. The last square has
an island in it, but cannot
lead her there.
	returns from the forests of Assam
	in which he verified the Tea shrub to be
	indigenous, abundant, and virtually
	inaccessible. At noontime on the upper deck he brews
	an ordinary Canton cup; salt tempers its oils, discolors
	the spoon. The backs of his hands shine.
	The Quaker captain
	nods twice a day. Afternoons,
	Thomas visits the Thibetan goat, the ten curious sheep
	from Singapore; he looks for cracks or seepage in the lacquer
	of oil tubs, checks the fleet of crates--cheated
	of tea, they carry tortoise shell, jars of green
	ginger.
                    Sweet evenings,
	it is not the mild vegetable infusion of his family's name
	to which he turns to soothe the tick of unused muscles
	before sleep, the cabin's tilt and tilt
	about the hammock's axis; he downs
	a glass or two, another few,
	and tinkers with the fates of friends, acquaintances
	he has not seen these thirteen years.
	Stood out of the estuary, just
	afternoon; junks
	joisted baskets of exploding crackers, gongs
	talky at our going. The constant stir of water is
	a second silence. The men are calm; sleeping
	without blankets, they perfect
	our vulnerability. I balance, idly, old
	accounts--the Fox & Geese, Hampstead: 7 chests pekoe,			
	tincture of rubarbe, sugar in loaves &
	for Sundries Forgott. -- and write odd
  letters: a faster ship may pass for them.
                                                           Around Good Hope,
heavy weather, a hundred ducks
drown in the hold. Now
I keep to my cabin, a pint
of bitters. In all this wash it comforts me
to see sharp things, the nice
strokes about the elephant's ear
in the aquatint I have for you. I am uneasy
at whales. Algae thickens: we must be near

belled towers. Squares.
Oh solid and to be praised
stone gates, meadows, your estate.
At night an abundance: yellow, white
windows.
The paraphernalia required
to take the turn-of-the-century photograph
must have been considerable
but common enough
that no one is paying much attention
to the contraption on the beach
-- most of the secondary figures show
as backs of hats, or
backs. The donkey, of course, is
disinterested, head half out of the frame.
It is the style of his species
to be undisturbed
by messiahs or machines, whatever
their reception by another genus.

In the two dimensions
of the brown and white photo
printed crooked on a post card,
the woman seems to be wearing
the building behind her as a hat: two large
arched windows and cupolas --
one louvered -- of a streetcar station
frame her head
as a pagoda does a sitting saint.
Under the brim is a fringe
of tassles, which are distant women
in long skirts on a curved sidewalk
going to meet the next car.

With bare legs dangling
around the donkey's barrel,
two children stare at the mountainous
camera on command; their histories pause
in their held breath. A hand
on one shoulder of each child
like parentheses or white
halves of a prayer, she stands
behind durable beast and passengers,
pointing the latter in the direction
of their inscrutable futures
while other people hurry up the street
to catch theirs
and the century turns a corner
of its own invention.
The maze is round and blue and green.
Clouds float over it,
and feathered ounces fly --
ouzels, loons; their cries sound
like miniature wine-glasses breaking
against the crusty earth.
The birds are white flares starting
from dark trees and viny swamps
as if in celebration. But what
festival is here? Are the droplets flung
from the hands of drowning men
tossed in joy like rice at weddings --
the worthless coins with which
they try to buy their breath back from the sea;
are their last cries
choked with gladness?
                                             The globe is lovely. Colors
fit together in intricate designs
that wash away, and form again;
the planet in its veil of weather
wobbles, bright and dark. Clouds
and birds and cries
rise and turn together, fall.
Dissolving, they make circles
within the circles of the seas.
And land circles sea in
an ancient sort of dance.
God and the author knew
where the mice got the motorboat,
but they had it and some
confidence in finding their way
based on a hat with tea roses
they mistook for a chart.
The blooms were bodies of water;
stems, navigable waterways.
I remember a picture of the important hat,
concerned mice
crowding around it.

The vignette is both
brief incident
and running ornament, originally
leaf or grape, appearing
throughout a text.
Hence the bird, which flies quickly
into my mind and out again
several times a year.

The further we move from stories
that explained the world to us as children,
the more the images silt in, become
imbedded in our lives
and the lives of lovers,
friends. Boat,
lamp, sky, bird,
are no longer abstract.

Shall I take you for a sail,
sister? The boat you helped me buy
is old and strong. Shall I take you
flying, one wing in water, the other in air,
skating on the seam
between ocean and sky?

Years ago a bird flew into the cabin
of the sailboat where my two friends
were sleeping,
circled cleanly in the small space
and flew out again, past my face
into fog, and night, and the rush and bubble
of the fat boat pressing through
wave and wave and wave
in the middle of chart 13260,
east of Maine.

Now the wind picks whitecaps
out of the black water
between our boat and the power plant.
From its stacks, tipped with red lights,
fine black grit sifts downward.
We recognize ourselves as Adults
from our children's books, the ones
who seemed to knkow what they were doing.

The wind that meets the body of the sail
and curls against it, a few feet up,
is stronger than the wind on deck.
Water is less easily displaced
at the bottom of the propeller's circle
than near the surface. Most distinctions
are gradual; clear-cut ones appear
in fairy tales and in the colors
on the chart. White.
Turquoise. Tan.

How many stories have I heard
or read in thirty-five years?
They begin to remind me of each other;
the images vignette, shade off
into the ground that is my own
story.

I have been anxious to know
where I am going.
It is slowly occurring to me
that it doesn't matter, or it's too late,
or the question is irrelevant.
We are moored here
in Salem Sound
taking spray on deck, the boat
bucking and water creaming at the bow
without our going anywhere
but a few feet up, a few feet down,
and some weaving back and forth.
We read aloud to each other.
We tell each other stories about our childhoods
lived in the same house
six years apart.
We listen to the wind, read some more
in the cabin lit with candle lanterns.
I sleep
lightly, and in my dream
the bird flies into the cabin
and makes one circle, the shape
of the world, the shape of a hat,
the shape of the stories we make of ourselves
asleep, awake.
All her instruments read zero.
The cockpit is filling with water.
She crawls onto the fuselage, knowing
it is done, the flight she started from New York
and another one as well. Lying on the plane's tinny
wing, hollow as the bones of a bird, she looks up
at the last cloud she had fuel to fly through
and tells herself: it's a warm night,
don't shiver.
                   The tail tilts up and she slips
into the sea, her leather jacket heavy instantly.
When she knows it is time to take
a first last breath of water
she makes it deep,
writhes

and loosens,
sways down through colored
layers to the mud. White
crabs and bottom-feeding fish
take back the miles, one by one,
and seaweek twists in wreaths around
the rusting struts and bright wings
she rode down.
My arms try their reach
toward books on upper shelves
instead of stars,
but I am drawn
by the pilot at the bottom of the sea.
I want to remember her
gently, find
her lack of fear, shape
my years into a flight
that embraces the world
and let go onlyl when
there is no other way.
Before what is myself becomes
stiff and glazed, I will
talk to myself, to you; we are
falling together.
Your sister's sitting for you Vuillard
intérieur, jeune fille assise
among the plants and her hands are empty
intérieur. rouge et gris

She looks straight out of the colors Edouard
intérieur. bleu et vert
The house is a frame. She doesn't go out
intérieur. fenêtre ouverte

The leaves in the print of her dress can't drink
from the window's glass of air.
The blind lets in light in bars you can see;
she's clear as yourself Vuillard
Plaster drops from the long thin boards
into my shoes at night.
I like seeing bare laths, the truth
of how a house hangs on. What did I think
walls were? I saw only
the costume, paper wrappers over
the stuff of them.

Nothing could disguise the catastrophe
of your bed. It clanked, it rattled,
it shrieked: it must have had
moving parts, like a heart.
If we had slid underneath and looked up
-- what mysteries! All the machinery
of a pre-Copernican universe, whirs and wheels,
clicks and clutches, pulleys and bearings and

brakes. I know there were brakes.
The underparts of the bed must have been
as intricate as the rituals you had
in the morning, the ones you had at night,
to keep away fires, and lightning, and hurt.
They didn't work.

I was afraid of your fears and left you, trailing
loose clockworks. What did I think
a love was? Through the wall
I hear a new one moving.
	A carafe beside her bed or a glass goose;
	a piece of water, stoppered, or a solid chunk, like ice?
	She watches it all night,
	death, the brightening star.
	She thinks it is one with her all along
	or she thinks it is the final thing she contains.

	She reads all night.
	Under a microscope there are lights in a leaf
	that flicker, and go out, as the leaf dies.

	All night.
	Cities of lights.
	A glass of water has as many.
	The smallest piece of water has lights in it,
	she reads, and looks
	at the carafe to find
	a juggler tossing jugglers holding stars.

	She is a maze. She finds a candle at each
	corner but loses the way. She thinks
	she can make it up as she goes, strike
	a bargain, make it stick.
	Or she thinks she can't,
	turns again.

	She wonders what holds her life together.
	Not herself; she too is held.
	Something does it like daylight through
	a glass of water.

	She has a son. He cuts his hands in grass,
	long grass that leads to the sea.
	He listens to water.

	She has a song for him, tells him
	the first ladder was a fern; she shows him the lines
	that craze a leaf, says she's not, he's not
	out of the woods yet, praise be.
	Whatever he sees in his hands is beautiful.
	He sees lines; stones; lumps of glass, often
	(often they are green); a carved cat; he sees
	the last day of his life.

	Looking closer doesn't change things.
	Through a magnifying glass obsidian is still
	glossy, like a muscle; a moth's wing
	porous as manila paper.

	He thinks he could put a bottle together in his hands
	if he had all the pieces. He looks
	for them, stands

	waist deep in grass among the dull
	green lamps of fireflies, hundreds, below
	night-hawks flashing their wing-bars like lights shot
	from a wave.

	Days open and fold. Geese
	slide through them, French curves.
	The hawks shriek and turn;
	they are pieces.

	His rooms are a forest of things that have
	touched him, including a jar
	of rain, a pair of marble pigeons.
	He picks up some white glass to give it away
	and keeps it.

	His hands tell him everything. They ache
	when a friend he desires turns away. Still
	he thinks he can find and keep them
	all, all his days.
As you were.
What are you looking at now.
I'd imagined you too long, made a hieroglyph
of your bright hair.
You came and were gone.

A scenario: the grey birds and the white birds
adjoin each other like words.
Adjacent.
The roots of thousands of plants press against the walls;
inside on the walls all my friends are dancing together.
If one is gathering facts
these are merely adjectives.
Regardless.
The failure of not having seen is nothing like
the failure of not having looked.

The verb "to come."
How did you know about caves?
You knew where I would come and gave me a prophetic
look.
The book about caves is filled with pictures,
words and pictures, the moving cat
in several positions.

The leaves of a vine or a sentence.

I suppose we are adjacent if you want to
go that far.
I have rented a burrow for the winter;
if it were a donkey I would ride to see you.
My words were sent
to see you;
the rest of you is left to read the book,
the birds,
the walls.
You return like a new moon, lost friend found, you
build, retreat; a glacier. Coarse & steaming
caribou rummage over it, leaving tracks the size of
dinner plates; beneath its creaking mass, forests

bruise to coal. Yet you pass lightly through
the glass doors between my days, as easily as the sea
lifts and carries its tonnage of ice-shapes, that
broken alphabet. Right hand meets left: as often

you come, from countries in the sea & continents
of snow. Where I live, the woods bloom thinly,
black and white. Still, there are tracks. Still
the branches empty of your weather, and fill.
Plants pull light through the windows, save it up.
He keeps pennies and birdseed in potsl. In other rooms
men sing loud as cossacks carousing in their socks.
They drink to the rowdy sun. A yellow bulb

of liquor warms in his hands; he rubs them dry
on flannel sleeves. Outside, with practiced shrugs,
ducks adjust their plumages, which are white
purses nearly translucent in the sun. He adds ice

to his glass. Doing things one by one keeps days
apart, keeps him from stopping on the roominghouse steps,
forgetting to go in. He thinks: the clutter of ducks,
the plants, are forms of sunlight, smaller lights.

He thinks if he remembers everything, everything
will fall into place -- the men, the drunken words they sing.
Two fish
alive, strangely, in air
lay fat and heavy,
one in my hands and one in yours,
and looked peaceful,
happy, even.
We hadn't caught them;
shiny and solid,
they materialized
as we sat in the dinghy
in a harbor
under the wide sun,
looking at each other,
good friends.
What I remember
after falling up the familiar darkness
that always surprises
at the end of sleep
is that they were different:
yours had stripes
and mine was mottled.
So the meaning that follows me
above the surface of sleep
(the meaning, always less
than the dream)
is that we are different,
in the middle of all we share, and that
we can be peaceful with that fact,
happy, even, in our strangely
shining lives.
Look at the birds in the tree,
you said. It sounded like a sentence
for children learning to read.
We drove toward the tree.
The starlings lifted as one
and printed, on the white sky,
a second tree beside the first.

The trees I am looking at now
are blue ones on the white china cup
warm in my hands.
The radio is tuned between stations
because the fizz helps me think,
blurs the voices that rise
through the wooden floor.
Sometimes they are children's,
cutting through wood and static
like the cries of herring gulls.
What? Why? Why?
Why do they ask so many questions?
Why do you ask such hard ones?

There were no curtains
in this small room by the sea.
A roll of glazed, white paper,
meant to wrap wedding presents,
instead protects my privacy, tacked across
the four windows. They bleach sunlight
to the color of flour.

The grove of blue trees
surrounds a pool of coffee,
black like roads in cities
and birds in wet spring trees.
It sounds like a story
children learn to read from,
words forming slowly in their minds
next to their images
of tree, road, bird.

Covered, the windows are screens.
On one of them I see us driving
under a sky streaked with birds.
You are careful of my privacy,
and your own; the questions,
infrequent anyway, stop
if you see I feel pushed.
They ask me
to make the globe in my head
a good place to live.

Words can form maps
to make the world clearer.
I care about you.
Birds hidden in the china trees
fly up in a blue stream.
When I go into the day
they color the sky.
Some wood lightens with use: paths
I walk through these five rooms
are the color of grain --
wheat, let's say, for its productive
connotation. The staff
of life, however, is work
enjoyed.
Some wood
darkens with sweat, smoothes:
ax handles, slender and delicately curved.
Leaned against a shed
somewhere in my childhood,
the axes were taken in at night
to keep them from rust
and racoons. The latter
craved salt left
by the sweet work of humans
who craved the work.
Chips from my grandfather's blade
were thick, uniform
and hot in my fingers.

Hey, you,
is this where we're going to live?
Worn wood house, floors
gone honey-colored, dark
doors. A city house
since it was built, although
the city wasn't always urgent
(trucks shake the walls, sirens
rattle windows): once
only hoofbeats
on hard sand, carriage springs
squeaking.

The blonde wood of the doors
is painted with an imitation grain,
small strokes and walnut swirls
intricate as weather patterns
in a satellite's eye.
Every door in costume,
a few understudies stacked
in the basement.
Hey, you.

When I was in grade school
I looked at things
more slowly.
I noticed the grain in desktops,
put out my hand
to each new iron-legged comrade, confidante, menotr,
as if to introduce myself, felt
its surface, rubbed smooth
with the rubbed spines of many books,
the same book over and over,
but different students reading differently.

Hey, you,
in an old house
with tools that want to be used.
A few cracked windows. Outside them,
cars and radios and shouting people
make a city.
Inside, I discover the door's duplicity
by looking at wood carefully for the first time
in years. Real wood
made into imagined wood.

So the you I'm calling to,
the you that is me,
the one who wants to tell me
everything I know,
is both real and invented,
the woman whose name is on the front door
and the imagined person, the one
made with small strokes
on this paper
that used to be trees.
	A pier glass as a conjunction.
	3 glasses in a line.
	Looking out            looking back            looking out.
	She holds up stones to see
	them glossed, pitchers of milk, porcelain,
	quartz; herself among them.
	Beyond the sills the white clay hills appear
	and do not            appear:
	a partial view of the cliffs.
	Hills of china,
	hills of france. She
	compares, holds & beholds
	earthenware            paper trees            a wood duck            decoys.
	The glass is in her hands, her eyes. The vase
	contains voices, her own
	among them.
	A bottle is a breakwater; an eye holds
	a shotglass of the light the world sees.
	Her image flashing for an instant in his gaze
	shatters but recurs, a surface looking in.
	A linear impression: a hand-painted piece, perhaps
	Limoges. A long time.
	These fragments frame a question. A

	broken mirror breaks again: cracks,
	flawed glass.
	The figure in the glass returns at length.
Come for tea,
chickadee in the evergreen; clear green tea.
How long. Oolong.
Music on the porch.
Foxtrots on the lawn. The stems of the mint
are as square as the steps. Come.

Comfortable. A white cloth.
Cream tea, sugar tea, round. Steep
steep tea and light brown light.
Earl grey watercolors, glazed
clay urn.

The azaleas are lovely. Why
be one? People do that, put colors on. Why be
jasmine tea drinking.
Among the bittersweet bushes
people keep talking and drinking.

I watch the easiest one.
Someone at ease is at home, his house is
anywhere a capital letter made from
the air about him. An initial,
what is the rest.
The house of air vibrates in the sun: his voice
unfolds, a bird unperching.

Things keep going away.

We two make a system, water and land.
A shore is an assurance, it moves a bit but it stays.
I see you, his look says, open
as the air that holds us both. Some water
is ice; people do that too, go cold and hard.
Everything does. Transparent puzzles

are difficult to assemble, the mind's
a delicate subject he says.
His words fall down like pebbles, a lot of letters
he puts together and throws away.

Things go away, no one can keep
a river around.

The last of the mint-light light from
the big elm lamps.
The last of the glossy ice, yellow tea, the last
taste taken at the engle
at which birds brake.
He goes. Come again. I see
a G clef shatter
in the empty glass set down.
It holds us, gently,
together.
It presses out, against the eardrum.
It presses in. It curls
in the palms of our hands

but holds nothing
to itself. It steps over
the sock flung onto the chair, the blouse
on the floor. When we touch,
it moves aside -- a modest medium

that solid things displace.
The children running down the street
punch through it, leaving
a cut-out shape of each position
hovering behind them
for an instant.

It is made of round
spinning things, but
it will adjust to a rectangular space such as
a room.
It's the only company
the old man who stays in his long underwear all day
has.
He comes onto the porch at noon
to get more.

People identify it by objects it surrounds.
They call it "atmosphere."
What people see is
themselves: they approve or they don't,
they leave for good or they come back.
Air is innocent of such judgments, having
no personality to protect.

It has
a simple habit:
it fills anything.
It occupies entire hotels
in the off season.

It is drawn to emptiness as to
a question it answers. Only a person
can puzzle it: the vacancy interior,
locked behind the eyes.

It stays whole, flows around
the wall, the knife.
We can change it
as much as ourselves, or
another person:
very little.
It clings to us,
a loose but unshakeable
garment, transparent
plumage, a thin
atmosphere to our far-flung
colonies.

We share it
with whatever we touch.
When we hold each other,
our clouds combine:
suddenly we are hot,
kicking off the covers.

Ambitious,
it rises above its source --
ourselves or the furnace
in the cellar. A wedge
of warm air eases

up the stairwell,
as determined
in its migration as geese
in theirs;
nestles in the point
of the ceiling.

The primary source
is the spendthrift sun.
Our floating particle, the earth,
inherits a merest fraction
of the sun's largesse.
It is a magnificent
allowance. Ask

the old woman in the solarium, humming to her cat.

The need to keep our temperature
within a narrow range of comfort
affects the shapes
we call culture:
buildings, clothes are made
to protect or dissipate the warmth
within them. Hats, even; rooftops:
riding above a person or town
like accent marks above a line of letters,
they are as much the language
as their bearers.

Heat lingers about our heads,
halos for mortals.

Forced to give us up, it will
vacate the outermost provinces
of hands and feet,
gather in the fist
of the heart.

Sometimes we seek escape, dive
into the sea, drink iced tea in the shade
of the plane tree.
We can only modify it.
It is as easy to discard
as our lives.
Absinthes two absinthes. I did not press upon you.
A tendril, yes; confessed.
Contentedly. We ate carefully then we drank.
Two feasting forward.

Does it please you, our tendency
to keep distances between us? When we don't
look at each other we think we are closer, which
is why the gods don't watch us. The intervals
among them and you and me
are musical. I took
some last looks and now
you can resume.
A field of perfect clover: reasons
are not needed and there are several.

The flowers of wormwood are yellow or white.
The flowers of anise are yellow or else white.
Two dark green oils one
bitter one sweet. Absinthes
two absinthes. A couple is two.
One and one or
one and another
make what? Our glasses touch.
If we are dying, let's do it slowly, together.
Are dolphins ever tired?
The way we have been leaping
about the steamship Intercourse and heaving
as if it ran on our hot breaths;
the way we have been yelling
as if our lungs were bellows for the furnace
of that gentle, violent vessel;
the way we gasp and clutch each other
like drowning sailors, then die to find
another life, ourselves transformed
and kissing easily as fish or playing
like dolphins over waves,
or tossing like the waves themselves
above the sea-bed, after
having beaten around our respective and
respectable bushes
on dry land for so long --
I am turned around, not sure
if we are found or foundering.
There is a storm above the waves
and one below, but for all our
sweet struggle, the churning all around,
our sporting in the wake,
the ship appears to be more or less
on course. We sight a new world daily.
I stand where the water will part.
Only a diver or a dolphin
will see the hull from here
after the boat is launched.
The bow strokes upward, sharp
as a steeple, smoother than a sail, precise
as a mathematician's thought.

Beech leaves don't maat like oak leaves.
They stay light and whole through the winter
and now they rustle, salting spring
with an autumn sound.

This is about woods.
Hamilton is not particularly important.
It happens to be here.
It's a place I'd never heard of
until I cam here to work on a boat,
miles from the sea.
I find it good to start
from a place I don't know.

My friends in Austria were attracted
to the birch forest silvered in mist;
they got a little lost, a little happy,
wandering and talking.
Then they saw a tank. Two tanks.
And men with rifles, very still.

Your eyes look past me.
I see in them a frozen lake,
a few trees.
I want to be something to you.
The dog is out of sight;
out of hearing, elven. I want
to make a difference for you.

We look at pictures
of the boat being made.
Fiberglass in a mold, it was one piece
like a need.
Needs are vectors; they point
and push.
Wants are more diffuse,
care less about getting to the point.
They might have no point at all
or several.
Wanting is negative, something
absent, an open space.

The puncture from the thorn doesn't bleed
although it seemed deep.
Because of the beech leaves, I can hear
the dog disappear.
Trees change as we look at them.
The light between them and us
changes too.

We sand the hull cleaner.
White dust shoots from the electric sander
and drifts from handheld sandpaper,
aging us through the afternoon.
By six we are gray.

Wooden silhouettes of tanks and soldiers
were propped against trees
in the story that started
in the Austrian woods.
And then there were real soldiers,
very young, with cheerful faces,
who made sure my friends had a watch,
told them the war games
would start at two o'clock.
There would really be shooting.
They should be sure to leave.

One field away from the boat in its cradle,
the dog curls up, brown bush
among bushes.
I run a thorn hard into my finger
as I untie her.

Now you look out your kitchen window
and your hands do nothing in the sink.
You look out on the lake
that exists only at the back of your eyes.
I am walking in the woods
around the lake, meeting
the many women, men too,
who love you.

Yellow beer and the light gray trees.
The crisp shape of the hull,
primed now, white, waits for color, poised
on its stiff wooden wave, beamy
in its cradle.
And the dog runs the anchor line
around four bushes, maybe five; enough
that she can't move. I'll have to untie her.

In Provincetown we walk up a dune
that has buried the trunk and branches,
and stand at the top of a tree,
are for the moment
heavy birds, see the buds
that will open late this year
and for the last time.
The path is narrow and fenced with nettles.
Farther into the dunes,
tips of branches show
a few inches above the sand
in roundish constellations
that were leafy crowns.

Here I come. I say it
so as not to startle you
in the rooms of your quietness
where you can forget I am in the house
because you are thinking.
Solitude can be constructive,
necessary.
I have it too,
a place simply apart,
not withheld.
A cool place to swim, the water
tinged to tea
by oak leaves.
Here I am.

Deep, deep in the woods,
past loneliness, past
the part of the forest we can see at all,
the dog is lost; to us, not herself,
like a person beyond thinking.
Animals go there and don't notice.
They press through the dim green light,
their paths opening only as they pass.
I've seen waves open like that
for the keen shape of a boat
and shut again, and be the same.
There is nothing to be done about
most things.

Pardon me, but you do have
just the right amount of hair
on your chest and arms.
You are really pretty.

Baking steams my windows white.
I don't expect any one thing
to happen. I concentrate
on not wanting;
a double negative,
a space surrounding a space
like the plains upon plains
of the sea.
I havge only a few wants and
I can keep them or give them away.
I will love you as I do
certain landscapes. Shallow hills, say;
a few thickets.
Nothing alarming.
Don't be afraid.

We needed coffee.
The store was a long way back.
Dry grass stabbed our feet,
and I fell behind.
You said quietly, "I think it's best
to ignore it." I was just able
to do that. I had to work at it.

People don't make people happy.
They are or they aren't.
You don't seem to mind much
either way.
I guess it isn't particularly
important. It happens to be there
or not, like this town or that, this wave
or another. An old friend
calls all of this,
boat, dog, trees, soldiers,
he calls it
"passing the time."
So much is aimless. Her poems are
taut, high-pitched; like a scream,
yes. And she had had enough of living.
When I was fifteen, reading one of her last
poems for the first time, she was dying.
Daffodils by the thousands, bees
in their sticky houses, wax and heavy --
these could not save her.
                                      Taut, a bowstring:
the idea that tore through
her mind, as if shot from a terrible cupid --
that death would solve what marriage, what
children, had not; that women sacrifice
themselves, half-willing victims of marvelous, discreet
malevolence--magnetized a hundred troubles
to point to it: the coldest winter
in years, the electric strike's
blackouts, even the stars
pointed that way
in a mind made up,
in an instant.
                   Let us not
agree. Let us go to the Devon house next spring and see
daffodils bloom, bees swarm; skim cream
warm off blue milk, make the horses sweat
with running.
The cat's fur warms quickly;
the pads of his paws take
longer. The air he has left outside
looks damp, a layer of diffuse waves
above the dense ones in the bay.
A snowflake snaps
its complicated parts together
in my mind; the snow I think will fall soon

is already falling, invisibly high.
The cat makes himself neat
on the sofa, tucks his paws under
like a package beginning
to wrap itself. Self-contained,
he has his own weather
indifferent to the first flake
emerging from its tall cloud. Neither of us
sees it slide
down the long frozen cliff of air and melt
on the shoulder of a wave.
Cats become more visible
after a snowfall.
They pick their way through the wet streets
like old people;
they avoid the white lawns.
It has snowed for days, the double-sided waterfront
crackling with ice, ducks taking to deep water.
Snow blooms in window-boxes.
All the cats in Provincetown are sitting on fences
watching three days of snow become four.

Each flake has miles to fall, takes
hours; sometimes it flies upward in the wind.
The cat sits at the bottom of the air. Flakes
stand in his fur and do not melt.

When it is not snowing the cat watches
everything that moves.
When it snows he watches what doesn't move:
the spaces between flakes. Trees.
The spaces between trees.
When he runs into the spaces, he is still.
Streets, houses, snowflakes, people
fall past.
Husky-masked, bologna-tongued, Pfoxer
settles her bulk on the bed and props
a long jaw on the window sill
like the muzzle of a pioneer's rifle,
heavy to hold alone; pivots it
as she examines the gestures
of grass and birds. The universe,
itself created expressly for her perusal,

is putting the finishing touches
on an August dusk.
Red light slides up
shafts of grass, hesitates, then
springs; the luminous tips blink dark.
The field cools and ticks like an engine
just turned off. She scans it
not for Indians but for rabbits,
those fascinating creatures
with ears so like her own -- long, soft,
alert. Surely rabbits and she have interests
in common, issues to discuss with little fear
of disagreement! But the difficult cousins
have so far fled her well-meant attention
and all invitations to play.

She sighs. She closes her eyes and allows
her weight on this side of the fulcrum
to swing her face toward the moon
-- rabbit-light, muse to whom she sometimes
raises voice as well as nose.
I would not care to wager
that she does not register some delicate
moon-scent
in that moist, oversized chemical analyzer
that is the furthermost point of both
her physical construction
and her sensory appreciation
of the above-mentioned universe.

Her paws work in a dream. She shoots
after rabbits, or moons.

Muzzle-loader, she slams
her own dinner home; lifts
that magnificent sniffer
to consider my choice of spices
for the soup; longs to get my dinner
in her sights, too.
I agree.
The house plant plagiarizes the field of
wild flowers; imitation
is inevitable.
My mother at 27
was probably looking at her Pittosporum japonica
and talking to herself.

She married late; I was born
when she was 41. It's never too late
to put the self together
with parts of other people, to become
a piece of the world they likewise
possess.
"My daughter is . . ." she tells her friends.
"My daughter is two; she's learning to talk;
I've taught her every word she knows."

The world can continue to exist only by
repeating itself. In Magritte's Plagiarism,
made in 1960 or about twelve years after
myself, a field of flowering bushes grows
inside the silhouette of a potted plant,
species unknown but a late bloomer
no doubt. We late bloomers tend to be
self-effacing.

I have sisters. I have teachers
who are also women.
I grow up
as in a convent. The japonica
has white flowers, waxy, well
protected.

Two mirrors hang on opposite walls
of the small attic room. In one,
I see my pigtails and blue corduroy dress
in alternating front and back views
12 or 21 times
depending on what year it is
and how well I've learned to count.
The line of little girls
curves out of sight, but I'm sure
it's endless, like numbers.

It was an arrangement Tantalus could have traded
for his pears and pool
with no other gain than
a change of scenery.
Putting one eye in the proper position to see
myself multiplied ad infinitum
meant my head got in the way (I have since
found this to be the main reason
infinity remains undisturbed).
Trying to get my head out of the way
without moving my eyes
was an occupation that gave me numerous headaches
and glasses before I was five. Older philosophers
have gotten worse results
from similar exercises.

There are other mirrors.
I will fill the ungainly silhouette
of my mother's mother, the one
who showed me I would never grow up to be
a little old lady, that I will become
a large one instead.

My future still curves like the arc
of eighteen little girls
and exhibits the same perversity: leaned into, it
disappears. But now I know it is concealing
something more interesting than repetition.
It ends.
One thing the mothers and sisters and teachers
were careful not to mention
but that grandmothers boldly engaged in
as if it didn't matter what anybody said,

was dying, walking into
the empty mirror just out of sight,
darkening to a silhouette in which someone else
appears, someone familiar --
a girl running through a weedy field,
a woman watering a house plant
and muttering --
someone almost
the same.
Panes and eggs make fragile dozens:
two times six in cardboard nests, food
for angels who eat cake; three
times four the membrances between weathers.
Frames hold themselves in wooden hugs
that keep the world together, the glass
a cubist with twelve angles on what is:
peach tree; sea flexing; perhaps a house
being painted blue. Here, a Q:

a british line. A dozen people
wait to buy beer in the sculpture garden.
English sparrows and leaves also
stand in lines together, higher
than the humans. Big plants
digest sunlight and rumble in their juices.
People through the queue sit
to tea-cakes and quiches
at tables made of metal imitating
lace: ornate with curlicues,
the iron legs are painted white
as eggs. Dozens of dozens of windows
surround the lines of this and that:
the museum looks out, and in, 
at its informal center. The courtyard

a disordered game board:
tables white squares, flagstones grey, both
scattered crazily. Couples
play hearts everywhere. Queens and
pawns and wandering knights take cues.
Jokers coin jingles
and wink. Second fiddles
fiddle with their drinks. And hundreds
of visions of the light touching things
pass through the tiny panes of eyes each
instant.

Hands hold the light up
as they gesture, conducting
conversations. When
the people in the garden talk, they are
what they say. When they are quiet
their bodies are maps of the cosmos,
hands five-pointed stars. Fish dive in the blue
streaks of their arms, angels rise
in their smiles.
Rings and bracelets flash like waves
landing, waves fragile
as glass, as white shells washed ashore.
Gulls sit about with straight faces
as though they were not surprised
to walk on water, as though
they were here the last time
the bay froze, a hundred years ago.
They rise and squawk and fight
above the floes or ride them
in neat lines; as smart, in their white
uniforms, as miniature
midshipmen.
                    They should review
their charts, for half the fleet
lies jumbled on the beach--great blocks
like broken numbers dropped
from some celestial computation
rounded off.
                    These
grand pianos, polar bears, salt
barges, the sea's spare syllables
packed in ice--all have a second shadow:
melting, they etch their images
into the beach.
                       Surely
after their sailing drills are over
sea birds study the prints
of dark and prodded sand, short
-lived fossils of a slight
ice age; for recognizing the instant
at which drip and drip and drip combine
to fix a figure in the sand
is an exercise for mystics, the reverse
of seeing through a rainstorm to
its single drops, through
a rising flock
to its composite flights.

The beached hulls are shoulder high
but sinking, unbuttoning their gray crystals
one by one and loosing them, carelessly,
like small talk; dissolving, topside,
into mist.
               Here you and I
are rudly upright figures; we walk
among the non-commissioned battleships
on which the warm air has designs
of reducing to row-boats; look, we are
strung with them along an abacus
-- with these gull-crews, ice-boats,
this watery slip of a globe,
we are sliding toward a sum

who yet work our own passages
through the wheeling world.
A.
Acacia. flowering and an archway.
A round ambush = an abyssinian cat.
Consider lines as small events:
a curled cat uncurling.
Consider events as places to live, and
     paragraphing
               as paper sculpture.

A polygon has many angels.
How many cousins to the ounce?
How many weasels to the once?
Consider the shapes breath makes: words            clouds
coins in the blood
florins.

is structure on crutches. The sails of the woods
were awake.
Deeper than rivers forgotten
dearer than trees and bushes
clear like the music of the birds
of the forest of light,
bright like the fur of bees or of foxes in the snow
and like the deer that come and go,
not falling not holding on we steadily

Coming and going is neither perfect nor poor, the sails
of the forest are open and

green. A frond a friend

Pleased to be pleased.

      While he was in New England she was in Blue Earth, MN.

      The tomb of Neferrenpet is decorated with birds &

      casks on board & tankards too
      creak toward the feast, new earth: Vespucci you are
        in our veins, driving Fords and Fiats.

      Indians never rode on wheels although they lived
      in round tents set in circles, made mounds

      Bison troops, miles of muscle & cagey bone, drop,

      a hot heap, cool nickel in
      the next round. Of musketry. Of poker.
      Of gin. Guns & yellow wolves flash in timber.
      Cabins, uneasy, arrange themselves like steps
      of a proof, a logarithm raising
      the roof of Europe to the power N.
                                                              Another line of
      beasts, camels, come, eccentric,
      working bulky knees in starlight, in firelight,
      pioneers. The sacred ibis stirs among red
      reeds. Scoters & mergansers have been noticed
      by the crews of tankers nearing
      port. The hulls are heavy:
      honey; oil; & coin, the metal
      edge of conquest. The new coast the image
      of the old. Magi on the glassy desert pass
      pairs of herons fishing in the Nile; wooden
      saddles pitch like ships
      or prairie wagons.
                                     The passage,
      the long haul: such the sentence
      daily. While

he went to Nice and shared reflections with the waves, she went
insane, was sent to Pennsylvania a prisoner, an explorer
lost at sea.
She is a mermaid caught in a net,
feet merged into a tail-fin
in one webbed end of the hammock, or
she is a planet hung like a lantern in space.
The cords diverge
and line her back with longitude
and latitude, tropical waist
to temperate brain.
She is an angel lounging
on a stringy cloud, unleavened
cirrus.

Trees hang above her, their globy tops
bushy stars on stalks.
The leaves are busy with
all kinds of commerce and curious
emergencies -- green flares go off,
and smallish gongs; there are raucous
goings-on in the palisade layers
where pairs of cells dance between the columns
and odd ones idling along the fibrous walls
look out through leaf-pores
at constellations of leaves,
galaxies of trees. Waiters circulate
with drinks, and wiry insects perform
skating tricks and acrobatics on the waxy decks.
A party! The leaf manufactures
streamers and lights and sweet liqueurs
from the cranky air.

Though she lies lazy as a land mass
between the hammock's polar regions,
nothing within her precincts
is still: while some cells, of quiet
disposition, tend the elevators
of respiration, others drive sports cars wildly
through the tumbling blue traffic
of the blood, or jockey trucks of produce
about the stomach rumblingly; some dash
along nerve paths with telegrams
and holler out Halloo -- halloo --
                                                     She is
a red leaf! suspended between
the stout stems of trees and linked
to the living commotion
by the subtle twig of breath, that
ether
her mind has ridden on for years
like a flock of grey birds circling,
a school of planets swimming.
Perfectly black coffee in a white perfect cup, this
is simpler than flowered towels. The loom of course
makes its own arrangements, adding to line
histories of line, condensing
movement over time
into the short time it takes to see.
The thinking line is design.
Blooms.

Two chinese horses in a carpet.

Two chinese houses amid dim stems.

In the middle of the page is a photograph of a giraffe.
In the gazette, gazelles appear as paragraphs.

We make our rooms by hand: gestures create
the objects around them. The coffee as I mentioned.
Crockery. The stems.
A few vegetables and chairs.
The door is open a crack that is ajar.

He didn't raise hand or voice.

A stone jar smoothes with use. Useful.
An open door is empty.

A man we hadn't seen in years.
His changes made his sameness strange:
he moved us
to another room            out of doors.

A door that is opened isn't one:
a space instead.

A porch has insight like a bay window a glass boat or
bottled water. Inside
the plants consider, we sit with them;
they contain themselves. The broad
shadows of leaves make continents on the floor boards.
An english ivy, a boston fern:
we carry them off the verandah in their pots.
Wide and green, a port.

An open door is not one or two but through.
Openness brought by a stranger we knew.

Out of doors an open room.
A pair of donkeys on a red road.
A pair of pairs.
We think the monks are strong like geometry.

How many yellow robes
how many hours.

One in a row.

They sleep parallel like brothers like trees.
They often work in rows
in the hall
    the garden
by the fish
pond, they raise doves in a Roman ruined tower.
To what power does one raise a dove.

Doves are distinguished by pointed tails.
In the dovecote a coterie. a distinguished group.
Doux

the monks have a few for dinner however. A coup.

It is good that what they say disappears like food
or like a beautiful old father.
Shaping pots, weaving cloth: what they make
is plain. Their flowers are in their garden.

Foxglove. The figure of

a dove facing a fox is pointed at both ends.
They have no use for foxes; a brace
of pheasants is preferred.
They raise honey bees as well in the alcove,
the oldest part of the wall.
Their will is very old. They and we
arrange straw for bees in niches some of which are
occupied also by stone saints.
The bees are particular since
the straw creates their cloisters.

Finally we forget what we are carrying and do not
make mistakes.

So much of poetry depends
on keeping legs crossed
at the right moment 
but whether at my knee
or your neck 
that
is the question.

*

Don't waste time
wondering when our paths
   or legs will cross.
They won't or if they do
   it won't be because
   of a promise
   in a poem.
With high heels that place my ass
prick level     like a cat
in heat stretching out her toes
to accommodate whoever comes
and curled hair to remind you
of what it feels like
down there     I wet my lips
in labial readiness
shade my eyes for that overwhelmed
orgasmic look
and say
I dress up
to appear
presentable.
"God!" said the young poet
when he entered my bathroom,
"So many creams!" And there they were
on the shelf by the mirror:
cleansers and cottonwool, tonics
and softeners, tweezers, pencils
and shadows. "And I loved
your selflessness -- your body unaware:
you must spend hours on this."

I might have quoted Yeats
but shied of discovering
artistry. Once I too
had been shocked
when a wise mentor confided
her body was her pride
and she exercised long and hard
for the look of the aesthete.

This is no vanity of women:
my father powdered his face
to hide his beard in the afternoon
and the ladies revered
his wise innocence.

I too admired
but I knew
about the powder.

Do you suppose you
could love me despite
the creams despite
Adam's curse
or worse
because of it?
A crooked, close-mouthed smile
(I know that smile
gingivectomies make us hide
our new long teeth)
in a wistful crooked face.
(Your left eye wanders;
it must have taken years
to focus on the A B C
and no one knew   thought you
a problem child.

You seem
so demure
(but not demure enough
to cover what you knew
you could be).   How did you bear
those loves that damned you
for so long?
If you'd given them up
let yourself be named
"Bitch"   with no hope
of husbands, children, a split-
level dream  no plans
for professorships, sanity,
the love
of the right people:
could you have stirred your cauldron

and stayed free
from your summer hote1?

Would you have been here
to let me
take an open-mouthed snapshot
of you?
To strangers on the street
we were women: They could see
protruding from caressing sweaters
breasts riper than their bearers 
wills tugging whole bodies
passively, unknowingly behind 

The men from the factory windows
cheered as we passed by
and we passed by
for their cheers
walking a naive dog every day.  They
knew more than we
of what our bodies could don
"Jeannie and me"
knew only the joys
of an afternoon stroll
passing by
strangers in the street.
 Through the plexiglas shield you
 can see her quite clearly  nude body
 writhing against the exposure.
 The chair, the bed, the toilet are all
 transparent and there
 are no covers, no protection
 from curious eyes, from the crowd
which has come to see
the sentence carried out
 for failure to fulfill
the promises of voluptuous flesh.
She shrieks
but her mouth distorts its loveliness
needlessly since we
can hear nothing not even
the fingernails that scrape
the plexiglas.

When she sleeps, her legs
wrap around each other,
yet darting movements under eyelids
reveal her secret dreams.

Mostly she shades her face
with long hair and fingers
and rocks on slender knees.

But she refuses to eat, the keeper says,
in hope that once thin
the sin of seduction will no longer
stick. The trick
is to lose all beauty
and yet remain
alive. The line
is fine: To be released
while wasted flesh still throbs.
My thickened ankles at this time of the month
remind me of Mother

I don't hate her anymore

A sudden secret exploded in the midst
of an argument

My child and I don't really talk

No clothes suit her body
lengthening into my shape

Inherited flaws shame her

How long it takes
forgiveness

When the sin is within
Self

But the man who is known to wear
a white jacket
to cover
wild curlicues of hair
is absorbed in the cracking
of a tooth
of a woman not much older
than I
and I have read
All the English magazines
and have leafed through
the Spanish
and have thus been committed
to the whiteness of the waiting room.
And the protean lips of my mind
open suddenly and release
beckoning heat.
I shudder in the joining
with it n But let my tongue
meander through its bone
and membrane
the widening and tapering shapes
dripping



from above
forming
vaginal folds, coral
in their promise.
The white door opens.
Oh, let me enter farther

Not enough
not enough they say.  The list
is too short and the dreams
disproportionate  My mother
would agree, and the children
are fighting again,
so that I will turn
from the window and look at them.
And there
I remember
Lunch.  Margarine
in a pan schnitzel
and salad and the song
of the stalactite cave
comes back Bach
sings straight up
from the floor
and I melt
down to meet him
in the redness the spike of which
I remember
from the waiting room.  Hear...
and I poured
the juice on the floor.

Where would a poet be
without lists of things
to do? -- no ideas
but in frames, lists, theories
to escape...
Our flesh remembers its loneliness
from the day
and will not let
the night join us.
Though we lie naked
and open like spoons
under one warm cover
I will awaken
afraid.

*

All there is to know
of love
I learned
from your back.

*

To wake up each morning to a murder.

Stale air from wrinkled sheets.

Don't roll over and open your eyes.

Too many bloodstains to begin a day.
I am thinking of you and watching this fly thinking of eating
lunch on the backstairs and waiting to be taken to dinner thinking
of writing you the truth and scribbling
a poem
instead
moves out from vulture shoulders
craning round a perfect face
to smile at me.

I am
no longer carrion, have
pinched myself alive
yet quiver in sudden grace
each time that perfect face
smiles down at me.
wrong, pushed me to the wall when
I needed soft holding,
defended yourself in the mirror
while I licked my wounds,
fucked without your mouth
your eyes I was not wise
and thought you didn't care
now I know you loved me
unaware.
We're on the bed  she lies
under the covers, and I
sit on the edge, sorting threads
from the sewing box.
"Tell me about your lover," I say.

She is sleepy and speaks in blurs
but loves
to relive his flesh in words:
"His body's silky, like a girl' s 
slender and soft and kind,
gentle the way my husband
should have been."

She reaches for my hand
and sleeps.  I leave, weeping
for what love
could be, knowing
what I would have done
had I been he.
"You drive all right," the dentist says,
"I drove behind you all the way
And you didn't make 
A single mistake."

I know only
That I began at home
And ended here,
In your office, in your chair.

I was thinking about
How I'm going to get myself a style
That will show the whole of me. 
There's a hole in my daughter's thigh
Climbing a fence, she was impaled,
And I lifted her off the spike

Now on the table,
The surgeon breaks open the foil package
And she asks, "Will it hurt?"
He is tired of questions
"Just shut up and don't move"
He barks at my little girl.

"All right. I'll think about something else."

I nudge her, "Orit, how do you feel?"
"Quiet! I'm thinking about something else." 
Strange to have exotic blooms
In this tiny flat  the rented couch with faded
Red roses  bare stone floors
I sleep on a child's mattress
And dream of my wars.

Into this austerity of divorce
Comes a rich suitor, the old fashioned kind.
Tiger lilies and birds of paradise fill
The empty room. Vases and diamond
Earrings, candies and a toy horse.

When the gifts come
I tip the boy and count what's left

Enough
For milk this week? 
Dina takes notes at a lecture
The professor sits, thighs spread,
Telling his plans for research.

I watch the way his body moves
The fat, I'm sure, is recent.
He must be athletic. Does he still play
Around? He would like to, I conclude,
If just to feel
Love,
Warmth of a girl.

After, Dina has a lot of questions,
Some even impressive. I want to ask
If his wife is good in bed, if
He dreams of dying young, 
If he wakes at night afraid
He won't manage to pay
His children's tuition.

I wait in the corner
Until my chance
Has passed.

"You hide your light
You're always quiet
Why didn't you ask a question?"
This from a technician
Who has recorded the session
For television.
"It would have been
For your good
To be seen
To be heard."

I was off
In a different world
My eager questions
Would have been absurd.
The loom unwove while I slept...

Though I wanted it finished, decided, one
suitor selected, even if it meant
the world would topple
tomorrow  the tapestry
would be a tight weave
with a brown
border so that nothing
could escape. I have not the heart
to start again.

 *
There is danger
here
in these depths
that are too soft
too warm.
There is danger.
We may never emerge
forever be lost
never return
to our homes.
Arachne, weaving at the window,
lifts her head and looks at me.

Maiden light, sombre as a crone,
her tambour web glistens in the sun.

"Better than your de Kooning,
I would have been
an emblem for women
centuries from now.

"But you, jealous like Athena,
goddess of your household
alone,
plan even now,
the destruction of my art."

Who says this place is falling apart?
I think I'll sit down and string
a poem from my bowels.

Leave spring cleaning
for another day.

A different start.
It' s the old craftsmen that make it through.
I have thought about this a lot sitting in my chamber
with my powdered wig askew  white stuff
sprinkled on my shoulders, petticoat stained,
pimples, billet-doux, blotting grains
messing up the paper, the poems, the lines
while that obsessive little dwarf climbs
to the top. Each time he writes a verse  Swift sighs,
wishes it his.  God, my life is such a mess,
and I have to show it  not just on my dress.
I want what' s on the page to be as pungent
to the nose as I am when I can't get myself together
for the ritual of ablutions. the rites of Pride.

What is all this fuss about form? 
Maybe Pope' s verse will outlive that little
hungering wonder of a gnome. But it won't
have a damn thing to do with him 
like when you leave fragments of your statue in the desert
so people will assume you were quite a man.

Crafty truth is an oxyrnoron.

Come, lets go to the bathroom 
I want to show you something.
It never ends...
You break with a snakeskin lover
crawling, only looking forward
to a fresh pact, a clean
blackboard.

But it's not a test:
 pass-fail.
No amount of examination avails
to know
for sure
that it couldn't have been better
with him.
Four fingers in the fob pocket of my jeans
the tail of my suede jacket moving
with my fast walk  high boots clacking

on the broken sidewalks of old Tel Aviv
(cloth bag heavy with books sways from my shoulder)
on my way to an office with a patterned stone floor 
high walls lined with books on self-help,

the Holocaust    Nancy Drew    and the poems of my friends 
narrow arched windows in a rounded wall
the paint on the outside mottled from many layers

many peelings: an office for the Turkish police chief
once now a publisher I am on my way
here now on a clear fall day
when every detail every ornament of this
convoluted city is part of an arabesque
a single line forming
a perfect design.
This is just a grove
you told me and the fruit
no sweeter than those you can buy on the street
but here we can sit
beneath the lemon tree its sweet acridity
reminding us of other groves
earlier springs
on the wall of your skin at night,
Say, prisoner, let me in.  You scratch your leg
as if only you could tend to your itch.
I grope for your latch to near you gently
but all my hands touch is too rich to skim
and I cannot rest with just fingertips.

Where are your dreams, what
is your heart?  When it seems
that you start in your sleep
and your soft breath moves
from deep to fast pants,
how can I move with your dance?
A rainbow flies in his wake
each time he slaloms starboard.
I lean against the windscreen back
and cannot take away my eyes.

Aboard the ancient fishing boats
brown faces turn up from their nets,
smile at the moving halo of spray.

I have vowed not to cross men
with gods.  Yet as he holds
to the tow.
easy on the water
when my hands
would long have given out 
glowing, alone
with the early-morning fishers

I would pass my bread
to him
to cast


Here

now
I'm so glad we're not virgins
Or have to pretend ignorance,
Decorum.  I mean you know and I know
We've been through or seen or dreamed it all.

Look, I've given birth
Facing an open door to a busy hallway
Split the front of my dress before an audience like you,
Said the very thing I was afraid I'd say, promised not 
to say
(And heard about it from my aunt the very next day), 
shamed
My parents, and my children,
Time and time again
And lived through it all
And confess it all
And laugh.

What pretensions to propriety could I have?

And you you've heard this kind of thing before
Maybe not here, not from me
But how different can what you've lived or will live be
From what I know or will
So we can relax treat one another like cats
Who smell impersonally, affectionately
The private parts of guests.
Sometimes sex is an excuse to touch...
I dip my lips in the multicolor
wonder of your hair -- here soft
like underfur of kittens,
there like briars to my cheek.

My fingers probing feel
the softness of your skin
and we begin
and there is nowhere for me
to be
but into you
into me
I sit in the middle of the bed
look up to your face
down to your feet

Like cotton wool like snow
you lie
and allow me
to make of your quiet
what I will
If you stop me in the middle of anything,
and ask: "What would you rather be doing?" --
"Fucking" slips out before I think of the question

Though I have crawled out of bed boneless
only seconds before, would probably not even know
what was being done to me, so numb from sensation.

You say it' s an escape or a metaphor    for intensity,
contact.  Teaching, talking, performing at peak
does just as well.  Think of all the pricks
You've turned down.  I sigh.  It wasn't the sex,
I didn't like, but the men 
anyway, that was when
I was young, and didn't know what really counted
in this world.  The fine thing about screwing 

Is that it is always good.  Anything else
you take a chance.
There are signs in the morning -- hairpins,
stains.  Once I even found a jacket
pressed between the seat and the back door.
I left it there, and then it was gone.

On my way to work, I think of them meeting
in my car at night,
the only shelter from parents or mates  
This little love nest
I leave unlocked. 
The soldiers would come
into my grandmother's yard
pull the head off a chicken
and thrust it into her hand

Cook it    woman

The Russian soldier  the German
then
the Russian again 
The morning fills with the chime of the Glockenspiel 
...
delighted tourists lift their eyes
at eleven sharp to see
painted brass knights joust to the music,
Bavarian dancers spin on their toes.

I look down when they look up
hoping to trap some truth in smiling eyes. 
As if the museums had not filled me
and a good stein of beer not quite
what I needed right now
we continue in the late afternoon
to search for Koenigsplatz.

I can't remember its name
only that Thomas had once 
brought us through, on some
rainy day we were en route.

He didn't have to identify
this place here
I was no naive visitor.

I saw a man standing on the stairs,
his salute answered by a mass
of radiant soldiers
looking up all in tune.

I blinked
and a slim blond girl was roller-skating
in an empty square
alone. 
"I do not perceive my individual existence
apart from racial identity,"
I hear myself say two months after
I've returned to Tel Aviv. 
The blond Englishman in the beige raincoat
encircles the Jewess with his arm
whilst strolling on cobbled Getreidegasse
between the show windows and the shoppers
and asks her why she lives in Israel.
                                                      She
covers a fierce warmth that wells
with    "I have no choice

"Born like you in London, but of survivors,  
raised with the ghosts of all destroyed
the aunt beheaded in the forests,    the grandmother 
you can fit
in an ashtray,    the whole    gallery some whose fate 
remains unsure
I must live in a land where I make the rules."

The arm
draws tight
protective
"But that 
shan't happen again.
How can you
believe it of us?"

Getreidegasse becomes Judengasse,

we enter a shop
where thick-braided salesgirls
disdain to show their wares.
To my question "Why is this called
ëJudengasse' when there are no Jews here?" 
they stare blankly.

Back home I warm 
to the Englishman
I kept at such a distance
in the twisting alleys
of Salzburg.  I clap
a souvenir from him on my car window. 
He
does not write. 
As announcements of funerals drone on
like a class list at the university,
Yoram frowns at the BBC sticker on my windshield:
"Did you hear what those assholes are saying- -
Israeli aggressors?  They defend England
by bombing halfway around the world,
but we can't stop the Katyushas
from destroying our kids."

I think of you, Glynne, in your beige raincoat,
and me, that apologetic, stubborn Jewess at your side.
"I am not against Zionism,  you understand,  but
a country born in blood
must expect
to live in blood." 
Near Mozart's birthplace, young Tom,
your urbane colleague from the broadcasting service,
told me:  "It doesn't matter now
whether we should be in Falklands.
Now 
We'd just better win."

You were a boy
when I was born,
both of us 
in the Blitz. 
Now a white-and-blue 707
flies overhead towards Lod, and I think:
what if it brought you here,
what if you could see me
checking people's bags as they enter the school
making packages for soldiers at the front,
calling every friend with a man or boy up north,
spinning the dial for more
more news 

Would I be the romantic Jewess
or the racist one? 
Skyhawks fly over my city
on their way to bomb yours.
We are awakened by the noise
and I fall asleep restlessly
dreaming of you and your daughters.

"If anything happens to my girls,
I hold you personally responsible."
April 25. Israel is bombing Beirut.
You and I stick to wine with our
lamb casserole in Cyprus
and discuss politics.

Spinning the dial now from BBC
to the Israel Army Channel 
I don't know what to believe.
The thin voice of an 18-year-old soldier
telling how a Lebanese
kissed him when he jumped out
of his tank, is muddled with the British
accents of the newsmen estimating
half a million homeless
in southern Lebanon.

Minutes after the cease-fire in Beirut
CBS photographs antiaircraft fire
from a small apartment building.
(Is that where you live? Then 
who lives with you?) The Skyhawks
go down on the city again.

Friend! My husband is in civil defence
and my sons are too small for the army. You
have daughters and are old and alcoholic.
We can't fight this war.
But both of us are in it
and responsible. 
Not a day goes by without my thinking of you...
as in a clandestine affair I am reminded
by the newspapers, the sounds in the air,
that you are there, and I in Tel Aviv.

Today brings a letter, postmarked Princeton,
sent through Jounieh to Larnaca on its way here.
You are well, as of the sixteenth of July, 1982, 
and today is the 30th. Last night
on the news, we were still pounding the city.

As long as we kept from politics, we were friends
strolling together down the sea road in an Austrian town,
shocking the guide with our nationalities
and talking Pound, sex, divorce, food, wine.

How our lives would be fine
now, if that was all there was
to talk of.  But where we live
we speak only of death and think
of somewhere else. 
Our portion is a porch 
a side room with two small, curtained windows
opening into the synagogue.
We, who meet at the pool in bikinis,
sit modest and kerchiefed
humbled to our place

And listen.  There are no books,
so I cannot review
the chapter of the week
or follow my son's bar mitzvah reading.

Standing around the Torah,
joining in turn in the service 
each man has his honor
as he welcomes a new member.

When my son completes his prayer,
we women will throw candies
from behind closed curtains.

I find my place next to a crone
who shares the book she has brought from home,
and, as she points to each word,
cries with joy "So lovely this chapter
such luck to be able to read this portion."

She compares my boy to hers
killed in the war,
and tears spot the page.
Sitting in the closed-off porch,
candies in both hands,
I weep with her.
Here a few poems,
there a few tears 
what more do you need
to give shape to your life?

*
To divide
is difficult.
You close me
and we know
that you are
after all
in your own book,
I in mine.

aeons old 
Evil dogs us 

We desire that this be beautiful 
that we 

go beyond the chill fringe 

Thigh- 
flesh glistens our 
minds flood 

We have stalked time 
to whirl upon 

to create 
for this moment 
one scent of hyacinth 

over the hills 
Indian Paintbrush 
in the cool 
valleys 
rev 
their slim engines 

Mountain freshets enunciate your name 

Your life long 
a tethered dream has 
crouched 
beneath your shoulders 

& now the wind knots 
your muscles

& sunlight sucks dry 
your blame 
Heavy scent of spring grass

Sun 

& she behind me warm

No cities 
no dream 
we are this naked beast

We move 
unto each other 
& are the syllables of sunlight 

singing 
A rainbow 
sifts 
about our heads 
on this butte, 
the stone 
ecstatic 
with lichens 

Birds buffet in flight 
with our eyelids 

A lone sheep 
an odor 
over the rocks 
pulls roots from our blood 
with its teeth 

& ruminating 
slowly 
we dissolve 
Peach blossoms drowsy 
in their curves 
dark branches 
like teeth 

Floating, the slight 
breeze 
of the wings, cool 
on your cheek, the hummingbird's 
tiny bill slips deep 
for the fluid 

Tall grass dancing, sun 
off fox fur 
reddish-gold, 
the young rabbit jerks 
as the entrails pull free 

Early evening a warm bath 

Night approaching 
a curtain of tongues 
Flesh traps 
rigid

This is Idaho. 
Drive through 16 miles of 
muddy, pot-holey spring roads 
to this frozen lake, 
pine-cloaked basin 
below the mountain. 

Is this God's country? 
Is that Him up there, lonely 
on man-fragile skis 
cutting slow zigs 
down the slope? 
There's somebody up on that mountain! 

No. The deep black eyes 
of empty oil drums 
say no. There's 
no one.

I trace 
with my pen 
a seven 

someone else 
has written 
& wonder 

seven wives 
or children 
or geese 

seven billiard 
balls 
or clues 

or seven 
graceful ways 
to die? 
It is her pale 
knees 
going to water I love 

when I say her father 
has died 
& there is hope for us 
To father, who asked, 
I say we've gathered these years 
to learn the adequacy 
of caprice. 

Our lives follow the goat 

& this vitality is as much of horror 
as we deserve. 

We will be responsible. 
Where there is beauty 
there is not defeat. 

Between tribe & estrangement 
we sink into the grasses 
with the horses feeding 
& brushing the flies away. 

We hold for some moments 
what will never change. 
There is something 
ugly 
in you, active 
as a transistor 
buried below the hills 
of Duluth. 

Who could love you 
if they knew? 

Who would stay 
in the same room? 

Survival is not beautiful. 

The evil of a child 
is delicious 
& continues. 
Pungent. Thick. 

Your movements are shaped 
by the basic forms 
of death. 
You rehearse 
with each breath. 

Your genius kills 
like a deer 
& is your best. 

This is glory. 
This is home. 

You're welcome here. 
A young woman is lying naked 
on the sand. 
Her clear eyes beckon 
the sky. 
Like a gem revolved slowly in the sun 
her thoughts make love 
to light. 
Pleasure hovers over the beach 
like prayer. 
Mrs. Place 
& Mrs. Place's sister 
Mrs. Smith 
make rugs. 
Rag rugs. 

There's more to this. 

Mary 
& Mary's man- 
friend Gary 
weave & build 
& feed the dogs. 

Joy is willed. 

Lois steers the Craft Shop 
& rocks her husband's 
boat -- he cracks 
his cradle leer & bails 
the water in. 

Her tie-dye treads his calm. 
His poems make her swim. 
Crossing quickly 
with no grace 
the summer courtyard torn 
by machines 
for improvement 

the fat girl smiles 
toward his window 
                              the peaches
in her basket 
nudging each other with her steps 

She means to tell him 
she too has scented fur 
beneath her belly 

& his bed would be a kindness 
she could forgive 

The peaches are bruised 
& she is not beautiful 

but they make good 
in the world 
this morning 
Squat rectangle rounded 
at the corners 

smudged black with rubbings 
makes time 
to be 

To touch its strange surface 
my time grows 

The thought I leave 
supports 
itself 

till snakes of soft rubber 
writhe off 
words 

dissolve 

our time 
comes 
Dip your pains 
in yellow paint 

Sell daisies on street corners 

Kiss her before it's 
down, 
she'll spend the night with you 

Are we together? 
Don't mistake the moment 
for Nature 

Fertile grass 

The deserved joy 
of brooks 

Isn't this a party 

& when we try, it's simple to go 
deep 
into daylight 
You dare intrude 
This land is 
A brave man needs 
    support 
Your woman is a trip 
    to the beer tent 
Piecemeal & warm 
Her firm globes bespeak learning 
Speed 
Breed for God 
From a grassy knoll 
Correspondence with an orangutan 
May the best man grin 
    till he becomes the epileptic 
    in the first row 
Keep tracking 
The whisper 
    between oak root 
    & rock 
Becomes a third party 
Lovingly. 
A milky translucent oval 
she clutches between 
her lips. Downy. "Cough" 
he said. 
No, 
       the sunlight lazy through gauze curtains. 
A passion without dust. 

"Sew me to your trousers." 

Whalebone. Shell. Do fake pearls 
make the best buttons 
for white blouses? 
Deep red 
of polished wood 
like tiny overturned bowls 
the swollen nipples. 

"Sew me to your mouth." 
Who left the green umbrella 
in 305? 
Who filled the ashtray 
with damp oats? 
Some young lady is humming 
toward marriage, 
her cautious petals 
still pressed 
between her Bible. 
Now three angels of metal 
bring gusts 
to the classroom. 
Three angels of musk. 
We must sing praise 
to the fields, praise to the fickle hammers 
pinging in our ears. 
We must touch those petals, 
must soften & swell 
with our lips. 
Then she will whisper "thank you, 
thank you for this." 
The glow of her face 
will lift like radar, will rise 
with pleasure 
between the columns 
of rain. 
The cat's tail 
matted 
with tiny particles of digested Kal-Kan beef 

beats time 
with my jaw-knuckles 

while my wife's 
nipples 
keep slipping 

into song 
In a song about Welfare 
I see my children 
by the thousands 
as tiny bubbles in fresh bread. 

Each chimes its own shiny note. 

I would like to eat your music, I say, 
& do. 
A 43-year-old sturgeon pokes fun 
at my pink heels. 
I've mastered the secret 
of water I say, 
the one we call "buoyancy". 
He giggles through his spongey gills. 

As I drift lower I notice 
the absence of flies 
& a delightful increase in humidity. 
A subtle purring reaches 
my ears, "sweet". 
It's the unruly dogs 
in the audience, she sighed, 
& we knew it to be the truth. 

In a kind of pastel exasperation 
we settled back to watch 
the seasonal march of the PhD's, 
the swamp water rushing in 
over the tops of their waders. 

Not even the bloodhounds follow them there! 

It's time we got hold 
of a parts manual, & a set 
of Japanese tools -- there's something wrong 
with the applause. 
We left the hooters 
on the bus. No telling how fast 
they might go on foot. 

"Up the rpm's!" 

We could still hear them, 
though we were separated by miles 
of rancid pork. 
The trail-boss was a re-cap, 
the cook a cop. 

At last, as we six gathered around 
the counter-sunk urn 
weighting missiles of spittle with phlegm, 
the hungry blonde whispered 
"I am the one 
who got the red bean." 

Her faith had won. 
We still 
the rocking motion 
the brain depends on 
the heart 

We bring patience 
from within 

The sense of novelty 
which fools the lungs 
to breath 

Come home dear Priscilla 
we need your hunger 

The dance the parson wept for you 
has come to right 

We call our nights the Parson Dance 

We call your novelty 
to make the little spin 
we feel within a certainty 

Strung through 
The pivot comes loose 

We quick behind the glaze 
Across the city
of Tiahuanaco
across ttme
my cipher seeks you

who've spent the sacred
Mayan nights
editing the Bible
who predicted correctly
the Book of Aluminum found on Mars

when are you coming home?

The children grow lonely
& down my dreams
the scarred dolphins shriek.
We are the assassins
of consensus.
Our laughing drags behind
the shards of life's coherence. Do unto
other realities.
Do unto your wife.

An awkward surge in the sentence purifies
this hesitation's interface.

Our quickening length
the immaculate
forgives death our passage,
& the moody region's terrorists.

Here our sex glances
like an off-rhyme

jigging the astral body.
Evanescent, she said. It's you,
lying on the couch, your naked limbs
illuminating the room. You are
sleeping, & with each slow breath
arises the body taking you away. Now,
below me, what is left of this world
enters me & stays. We are single &
together, what we have that touches
holds continuous & warm in a basin.

Reason is no enemy -- too cold & weak,
it incites no fear. Here all movement bends
toward center, & our delicious stasis
tugs out & spreads. This is the space that has
no negative, that owns all &
earns each moment our freedom. A sphere
recording its future as it grows.
Just beginning now an
order of event
reverses separate movements to this new & simple
dance -- a knitting,
a fabric of limbs,
night warms at the heart of our whirling.

Light now, it's light we
emit, & this
energy the center of the universe.
A certain amount of room to cross

the galaxy
recording us & our

utensils

the holes
our coins make

smaller the

arc of egg shell the minds kin
The pubic fur longs to be flesh

to know
the unsettling

Laughing pierces the durable
& is itself

You will meditate
for velocity

You will be The Astronaut
& at the center
like a crystal fist
we discovered the gland
inventing
the universe

You should have brought
the shovel
back. You know
we have trouble here.
The water's taken ill.
Your mother weeps her nights away
too. She fills our lunch sacks
with last week's rain.
And a kind of blue wart has killed
the peonies. It's your
backyard. The sand-box
is failing -- your father drank the sand.
You should have come home.
We need the shovel
Jack.
To Bernice of
the graceful pauses
I leave my metal crutches.
To her guppy
a bit of tripe.
My pulling out alive
will remain for Charles, his wife will have
my softest wen. And to the University,
where mother came to bone,
the jellied hum.
The aliquot of slaughter
will stroke the children to weep
for translucence.
To them I leave the crate.
Born of bafflement
before the ways we turn
to nothing,
born of substantial parents.

Calf-raffle. Baby's Breath.
Referenda gone berserk.

We loved you Julep.

Herd-weak & lost
to density cursing mass -- you've left
our space
a blind hole
that's all of you &

sucks at us.
The automated petroglyph
still hides
'below the Zen Master's robes,
weaving & bobbing
like a small rubber palm.

The automated petroglyph renews,
shedding listless caterpillars
onto our tents. Tomorrow
something yellow
must die.

The automated petroglyph returns
to the Chapel of Painful Submission,
its vestigial muscles
thinking hemlocks
throughout the suburbs.

The automated petroglyph
kissed
for its pure
oscillation,
sticks like grass
to the top of our heads.
Enormously at variance
with the mule's earache
& feeling precocious

she drew a picture
of testes flattened
between bricks. Knowing

full well the
aborigines
can't read, we flattered her

with studied leers
& led her toward
the "pit".

All twelve of us hummed
the familiar melody
of "Lost in the Vagina"

as she gestured cosmic-
ally, clawed
the air & fell.
Mrs. Drew tends
to be a little strange
anyway. She talked
all night
of something she called
metaphysical couvade
& the bulldog
cylinder.
Not one of us
understood
though she demonstrated
with a trowel.
Henry, maybe thinking
of what she said in
the tent, & hoping we'd look
to him for the giggle
slipped into
the creek &
shrieking lyrical abstractions
tore his trousers.
She reeled
fighting
for thigh-bound spirituality,
his genteel gore.
They made it in a tent
on a parking lot.
"We are animals in rut"
said Christine -the -slimmer.

Do unto your bumpers & grids,
do the macadam.

Lifting the coverlet
he allowed that chilly breezes
might wrinkle the scrotum.
Prepuce expansion.
Oh cock.

Oh Avis it Hertz!

1) Inventing the canvas fold-out
& rental sex-pack.
2) Preventing life on the highways.

"You bell my clapper" he sang.

3) A quaint church
nestling
in paved foothills.
4) Denying orgasm for reasons
too painful.
5) Applying physics to flesh.

We'll park our bodies
& find true sex
beyond the sweat & thrash
of the particle universe

we'll feather the waves
& make babies
in reverse.
A green plastic stamen
is the key!
Twist the appleskins taut, tie
the epidermal foil
to your foreknobs.

Once critical speed is reached-
your mother's menses
a kind of slippery ballad,
a Law degree or
something Alyce takes off on stage.

Let traditional metrics
rage. Pollen-dipped drumsticks
poached for brunch.
Look for a fence-post to rob.
Don't balk at the red owl,
it eats mushrooms too.
Deep behind its face
the inscrutable swims
for its life. Because it is

it means. Because it is no longer
the opaque window sings.
Don't balk at change.

A sermon encased in glass
whirrs out of steam &
we gather to hum its praises.
Precious droplets of common moisture
form a liberating chain.

A feathered forehead, a damp cowl.
My ass is a temple she croaks.
So does a frog, & there's more
to an empty wine bottle.
She likes to shout down freights.

She calls her coupling
the boogie fuck. Put a cork in her mouth
& she'll let go a few flats. Poems
like this are circle-jerks, they

jerk & circle, jerk & circle.

Her confessor swoons. My ass
is a miracle! A miracle
my ass, three Hail Marys & an Our Father for you.

She steals his sacred juices
& breaks wafer for good.
Bespectacled & prim,
Where in the backhoe legend
will we market this simple

disaster? A summer wasted on weed
is more than a professor.
A trick-baby striped like morality
on an orgy of rosewater. I said backhoe.
Cat. Rotorooter bliss

comes to college. Lets get
your 2nd grade nun into this.

Cross-masturbation. The universe
like a beehive. We'll spin the grim reaper
to a tight weave, chaste.
The peace-creeps are balling
the grunts. Here's
the old-fashioned blessing
for our lunch. The universe is chaos
& we're blind
to the hole in the shadow

of the cross
winds. So like
easing back to consciousness

this simple glider. From this high
the clumps of tiger-lilies a good case of acne
rampant through the fields. Don't
lullaby me you skinny stiff, I want meat!

No tantrum of genius will forsake
brute fuck.
Good & Evil, you think
of your married friends
who really dislike each other,
aren I t good for the children
seem wrong you say think of
the universe as a kind of beehive
but no, they have this vow

& John Ashbery
an expressionist landscape
the form everything seems to lean toward
the longer you look

She says "fuck you!"
He says "I'd like to"
& arches humming into his

The dangerous tomato
The immaculate
You take my fingers
& my elbow, my
scrubbed foreknob
into the Chapel of Tangerine.

You take me. My schoolbooks
askew in the damp grass
like so many stream pebbles.
You loosen the burnoose, a ripple
down my flank.

We drink. We receive
the citrus blessing a fruity
punch. Doubling over
in the position known to induce

I club you to death.
The tree surgeons did
what they do
made love with their chain saws
till you could stand no more
& left me here alone
yammering like a calf

I glisten with their immaculate killing

They've gone
& the leaves I sleep on
decorate my buttocks
with their veins

My penis rose like a tree
I cut it

please forgive me
So delicate a word
we fear the child.

You cling to your past
where your mother waves the blue kerchief

your earlobes flail, no no no
inert
beneath belief.

O love
our basement sinks

no colloquy can save us

you touch my cornea with your tongue
& we read it.
Adrift in a vision of mountain tunnels
trucking in the Rockies.
Loads of logs.

Your grandmother knew molasses
& your shoe,
the old one you used for packing-in your sorrows.
But the way they lifted off
slowly, with a vibrating hum
high into the thin, cold air

you felt cheap. You wept.

Drifting now a bloody knothole
in a suicide plan,
your fingers un-
clasp, releasing the only love she grew.
From his hospital bed he says
I miss the boar-grunt blessings,
dung on the wind. My chest
is tits & still they give me
needles. I remember

the old country. I know
dirty pictures in the attic
whack-off the teenager. What else
could I do? Too much

real butter. Suppositories
are no treat. The nurse picks off
the sheet & says she'll pray
for my body. Who needs that?
All anguish is theoretical,
wild saliva.
Who spit blood in the jujubes?

Brandy starts the new stance
below the addiction
threshold. We lay together
to break a moan.

This is about requited love &
the feasible orgasm
which happens
here.

Don't say this Is
the beginning
of a writing career. Don't say
career. These lines
are not "another matter"

& we don't mean to rhyme.
So take your terror straight
& pick out the cotton
left by
the headphones.
juice it.

It's the Muse staring through
like a laser sizzling a retina
brings us to an off-rhyme in home.
Brings us to drool
for crucifixion.

A sexual allusion to Krapp's last spool.
An erection of comfort.

The desire to end this
with something beautiful
is a kind of rape.
This is garden smack,
this is America.
this isn't Molasses University.
We're not in Kansas.

This is where it takes a knife in the back
to get dignity
between the lungs.

It's all a matter of re-entry speed
& pressed pink wafers
of fusil oil & blood.

Even the Great Leaders wake from their Dreams
with r.e.m. hardons.

They're after us pal.

They're not frogs
going gribbitz gribbitz in the mud --
they're swinging spades
toward our gardens, hankering

for cock & balls
the body's wrinkled tubers.
People do the weirds for more
money & fame than

Dildo slick as a skeeter's tongue

Wheels across space touching

Half the brains it took to survive

Sucking the artificial limb

In control

& weeping by turns

We acknowledge its pain but must
continue meeting microbes

A fistful of nightsoil reconstitutes the academy

Subtle

Bending slightly she

the spheroid desperation

Post-coital political struggle

Death as pleasure field

its mystical ash.

I can turn a sack
of blood garbage
into a sweet little tune.
It's the proscription of sextuplets
I'm for

there's a ravine behind
my dead grandfather's mortar-
chinked log barn
where I lost the double-barrelled
gun that shot corks

& dirt into her eyes
she cried
I couldn't let her go she'd tell
her mother

threw it in the crick
I didn't lose
my way back over the baby toads
ankle-deep
that year

I lied they didn't
like my nose
mouth I talk funny &
hate
your tongue you slut
Last week I talked
on poetry
for the artificial limbs people.
I floored questions.
They came around
flexing their fixtures, the sunlight
off polished metal
pulling the walls in.

I said a small poem you command,
the large has you in
for tea & locks the door.
What I said waned in importance
as I gained charm.
A musk grew I was
a buck goat fluttering my tongue
for a kiss.

There was Jeanette
whose fingers
& forearms were nude.
In her eyes was an intelligence
surrounding the room.
They worshipped her
& my presence was what they did to congregate.

I came to talk & they said write
for us a poem about her.
We've let you see.
Okra and bean sprites played riot
with domestic spaces

while terrorists rubbed plutonium

were cast, and before the mantle of persuasion
fell on its feces
a wizened Sufi surrounded the pile.

Earthworms went on strike
for safer loam.

Syllables followed like ill ducklings

A fine morning
to you.
Things are
shaping up for me
over here. I am thinking
of getting back into
Ham Radio. My job
is pretty good. Weather
here has been quite
changeable. Those pictures
are nice. You can get prints
you know. I'm thinking of
having one on my desk --
to remind me of our
"funny sides." I think you
should know I'm doing
better with my problem now.
In the study, near the bed, near
the blackened bootstring's
constellation of knots,
the old cat lies pulling at
her stitches. Already the fresh

bleeding has mixed with the orange
of antiseptic. Already the wound
has become hers. Now her sharp tongue

probes for the tumor, that comforting lump
she knew as a kitten. But no, her last
chance to nurse and clean
has been taken, and now her slow
body shivers, her head goes down.
Her face
a crutch
on ice

her thoughts
deranged as
a shattered hip

she comes forward
to touch
the infant's
genitals

with the cool
metal
of her spoon
Take the deaf
mute whose
eyes are twin stars
of pain.
Brilliant.

Take the country-
western singer.

Take the boy who wasn't
asleep
when mother
conceived his enemy.
Brilliant.

Take the billiant news
of cancer,
of car-wreck at
36 below. Take the love's chain-
saw in the limbs.
Home.
God's brilliance.

pull of
her breathing

I love you she
once said but
this makes

You hurt her
with your hard
body and then

you stopped her cold.

The rains took
her face
down the creek

old badger
praised her bones.

your future

a pick-up truck
driven into
the ditch
to kill a dog
He teaches the boys
and girls to play
volleyball and soccer.
He has the large
engine in his car,
which is fast,
loud, and silver.
Today the red-
head Hollywood star
is coming to the shopping mall,
coming with her
slippery oscar.
He wants to slide his
butcher knife
between her ribs.
His tiny penis
was eaten by
a rat in his crib.
The one tear she
shed for me
still limps home
with its burden of neon light

and I am bored in life
awaiting the sudden
Gonna learn to drive
the big rigs, gonna learn
to fly.

I been hanging here
since I was a kid, not
getting someplace, just getting pushed
around. I never much liked
this town, never liked the people.
I'm tired of trouble, tired
of being scared to kick ass.

Gonna get me a rig and make some cash.
Gonna set the record straight.
You there

        Middle-aged man
        in green work shirt
        pants
        work shoes
        with a dented gray lunch box
        under your arm
        stepping off
        that bus

              you catch my eye
for a moment
                     don't
look away
                   in you rests
                   a commitment
                   of mine

here
           let me carry your lunch box

you needn't know me and
you don't
                  but listen
                  I know you have a daughter
                  who takes lessons
                  on the violin         you work
                  evenings
                  tending bar to pay for them
                  don't you

sure
and your wife has four brothers
all of them bigger
than you
play poker        throw horseshoes

right

           but you don't
           really like them
           do you
                      that's okay
                      really

I know how it is
I know a lot
about you
                you're a nice guy

mind your business
just want to be left
alone
I'm going to kill you
She repeated for us
all she knew of
the amputee issue.
The bliss is untenable
she said, and spoke of a swarm
that complicates the tongue.
Avoid stray marks and corner rust.
Revive the hunger for cost.

We learned then our one decision
is made by grief-light,
and as we toasted the new
gangrene paste procedure,
her face became
the exquisite wound.
She is subject to toad
faints
the Doctor claimed.
His research in oral malfunction
led quickly to the mauve
fricative and

the buttery gleam
of tragedy.

The ward went ragged
to the moan of
let me be your bomb shelter baby...

Not too late for shock-tuning
and hormone
reversal. Too soon
for solar power. Profits
will suffer, wailed the Chief. Give me

health care that sharpens
the human, give me
an elegant cry
of despair -- nothing better!
Somebody consumed
the jelly-bean jewelry.
The black went first,
then those with tender green sprouts.
We must feed the world's wealthy, yes,
but is it Art? Will China realize
a handsome return? And how does Christianity
figure in this? Some fiend,
starving no doubt, ate our beans
without preference for color
or creed. But the black
went first,
we know that.
Even his armpits
are going bald.

In the corner of his mouth
the white fleck
of speaker's spittle
has been applied with make-up.

His face in the elevator
is a drainage ditch

and his asshole squeaks.
Who laughed
longest
when the bright
young
Senator from
Nevada
pitched
the Siamese
kitten
and string of lit
cherry-bombs
into the broom
closet?
No idea but
her penis

perfume

eyelashes butterflies settling
to eucalyptus

whispering

his breath
catches

and slips
You claim the poem
about water
that came when you pulled
flesh back at the sink

When you pulled your trousers on
you chose not
to identify the weeping

We'll be good friends
you answered
turning your back
turning a little red in the face

One's work makes demands

No need to defend
a commitment
to grace

No shame your
infernal genius for pain
If someone close
to your mother
said "I feel amphibious"
and your father came out
of retirement to
break that person's cartilage

If your younger sister
displayed suddenly
and no one in the family could speak

Would bottom-fish attack a skunk?

Could you walk out of your limbs
and survive?
It happens I'm dying
of this language.
I have become the lost
climber in the chilly
post-literal alps.

So high in the body the blood thins.

To survive I must be as intimate
as oxygen.
Starting with an emotion
inexpressible
as fear suffered
by a domestic animal, or hope
that the twentieth century will end.

A hotel falls into the ocean.

How can we tell what we feel?
Let us praise desperate repetition

the crone's worry beads
in an earthquake

the strings of dried mouths
about the necks
of the elegant Exxon wives
Let us praise bankrupt technology

the fingers of corruption
opening the dikes
of nuclear disease
Let us praise the church of born-again profit

Let us praise the politicians and polluters
for they are instruments of God

Let us praise televised armageddon
for we will suck poison
and destroy our young
Adrift in a haze of information,
the goat-footed turtle waits.
Nearby, dolphins invent topologies,
gorillas make signs and mute spiders
exchange epics of chemical speech.
Everywhere the organelles are chanting.

The managers and mystics are copulating.
The college of cardinals has targeted cancer
and the terrorists have employed T.M.
The curators bear arms and the sun
drums cadence to Jupiter's snake dance.

Now rising, heavily, like the crystal-centered
boulder gravity failed, like the balloon
of no karma with a small-eyed grin,
the red-faced genius mongoloid has come.
The way is simple, simple, we are saved.
I am the goat-footed turtle.
My house is four and my feet
are three -- the cloven.
I swim with the porpoise,
walk with the snake and deer
and I climb. I am the genius mongoloid.
I have come to lead you
to the new world.
I am Harry Truman
& have hurt you more than
you can know

it was my accent
my harmless collection
of Avon bottles
they are cancer climbing stairs
in your bones

I have founded research
there will be no need to keep dying
on television
& in the churches
no need to eat chemicals

all my breaths have been flattened
like Picasso portraits

please, I beg you, move amongst them
through my library
on the track we have provided for your health

You will forgive me & come to no harm.
Not far behind his yurt
where we moved
in a crouch
through the complicated greenery

where a slight breeze caused
sunlight to jabber at us
like a strobe

we heard the last rustlings
of bathroom noise &
noticed signs of feminine itching.

We discussed the area as a proper site
for yoga, then sealed
with bean-curd
our ear holes.

We carried with us four dark rooms.
Time to think of rodents
in Mesopotamia, & the yellow
Studebaker the girls broke
their bones over. There's a prize-
fighter in the Pastor's future,
alfalfa sprouts rafting
the melted cheese.

We form a committee to host
the second coming of
synchronicity. We ponder swelling
at the joint & the magic
of ear calves. Logic
is the formal accident we
will have no part in.

Citrus vermin & land crabs
have civilized a native
called Mordant. A shill. A stretch
of reason cuter than vinyl
veneer. We've earned our genitals
& class them fiction. We thumb
rides in the Satori wheelchair.
We happened on a burst
of brick music
36 inches from the yellow.
Adrian spoke in layers there
& to this day will
not compute. To some

the brick symphony, to others
lemon concertina
makes sense & goes
the distance. How convince
the family this talk
is not symptomatic? We care

for sincerity. We carefully
dismount the space craft.
Bereft. Be wary of
baloney boats & the Spring toad-count.
Be worthy of your name.
You are full, you are

64 sparrows & spilling.
First reclaim
the small
blue mouth
at the base of the spine

Then plant passion
beneath the landscapes
of protein

Now climb the steps
of semen
to the brain
She was the ground
for a no hint pass,
& she liked being that.
It was bugging a boulder
she'd say, or being a turtle
in a quarry.

She strangled an oak once
and though indicted
still got the bonus.
I can't live with this
her husband cried, she's a cloud
killer, & strings her

slavic grunt through my alphabet --
ain't a word in this house
don't leak! We took note
however, & reported him
the closet fog-racer. So she freed
us, took us off his case

with a suction so lethal
semen climbed the spine
& made thought translucent --
breath on a mirror.
Let me put you in touch,
you've been too long
in the head.

Halve a melon, musk
or casaba,
then rest your elbows
in the frothy hollows
while studying
a photo
of your lover in nude,

This is position one
& imagined while bathing.

Now stretching the fingers
in direct sunlight,
you will notice shortly a tingling in the wrists
& a slight pinch at the juncture
of kite-string & ear.

Being more than a metaphor
behind astral travel,
you succeed position six.

What remains is curvature &
a parasexual organ
of etheric viscosity.
Let me put you in tongue.
Remember our long afternoon of amusement
with their tantric computer,
the bent light and the liquids
where we found them? You seemed
alarmed. You spoke again of loss
and of the mucilage you valued as a child.
"The rubber tips made me think
of mother's nipples" you told me. You begged
that I forgive your debt.

It was like a dance we learned
by simply being where the music was.
I'm an architect
& these thin struts
of consciousness
are my portfolio.

You know my work perhaps,
the benzene ring or
that black tunnel twisting
from Christ to last week.

But it's these small things
make my mother proud,
the indoor root system
for liquid waste &

the transparent hair-net.
I'm planning now for
a perpetual -thought
space sculpture: a reversing

biocosmic field I'll call
the Cheops Chakra Cloud.
I figure we might program it
to pray, or prove we exist.
Coming around the bumper
of the lime green Maverick she
lifted her left shoulder and let out
a little whistle. Her feet were bare,
no 'crunch of the gravel.' Lamar sat in the lawn
chair, looking like his name. As she approached,
off the gravel onto the grass, her arms swung over her hips,
fingers doing a little air dance. Lamar coughed, sounding like a
small child, rose, and taking a long breath, slid his hand down the
front of her cut-offs. He grinned, 'hiya, Red.'
Leslie. We knew we had to figure the mathematics of the thing. We knew they'd be around any day looking for their money, and we had to be ready. Leslie was the answer. Six initiates a day was her average, and no repeaters. Sure, we used the honor system, she could be lying, but nobody doubted her abilities. She had left the Kundalini ashram after 16 astounding days -- slicing the tomato in front of the assembled members was what finally did it. They all witnessed what poured out. She had to leave, she said.
Erick came back to the shop one Saturday morning, visibly disturbed. Apparently the clerk at the post office branch had warned him that the Postmaster was planning action against the 'Cosmic Light people,' for the 'porno' we'd been mailing, and that the non-profit privileges would be first to go. I called an emergency
meeting that evening. We decided it must have been the promotional photos of our group massage program at St. Teresa's.
Getting the rifle and scope was a problem. To be safe, we had the rifle purchased at a sporting goods store in Kentucky, and the scope at K-Mart. We paid the buyers each $25 -- 1 don't know who they were. Red told us her friend Lamar could be trusted, that he'd been a sharpshooter, an assassin in the Marines.
Well, it worked. Time magazine is interviewing Leslie and me next week about her photographs. They are planning to call the feature 'The Death Aura.' Already enrollment at the Institute has tripled, and after the Time article comes out, who can tell? There will probably be enough demand to go national. Ground-breaking in
Detroit is scheduled for April. Eric is running for City Council --
if he wins, and he will, our local credibility will be
impeccable. I'm proud of us all. The real
work of Cosmic Light has
just begun.
Sorcerer, mutant, call him
what you will. He spoke of bird
funnels, and of the breathing mountains
before America drowned.
He described Earth's magnetic shells
as loose sheets of being, but the Pentagon
shot him down.

Memory is the backside of appetite
he taught us, we ingest the universe
with our forgetfulness. He said the door
to the world of surfaces swings in and
swings out with breath. It opens with breathing
and closes with our deaths.

Our bodies pay homage to the forms.

He wrote of sex as a ladder only two can climb.
His torturers remembered this
when they found him.
In the chapel to Nikola Tesla, which he built
of steady orbits at the age of twenty-three,
they suspended him on seven lasers
like a nude quail sizzling on a spit.
They jeered "wink out, you fool!"

But he was afraid, and fear is the black chute,
the nanosecond that never ends.
So he converted the pain and rode it out.
Our room
a gesture
              freezes

the walls are cliffsides
the windows
                    ash

a beauty gathers

& we breathe

we breathe to sing this fatal carol


Beauty is the butcher
whose lines

we croon
Gertrude said the egg-carton
made me do it, that obscene,
that formed low-grade paper
caught me holding breakfast!

So we got our gear together
and drew conclusions. We wanted
music as chilling as the moan
of reason going down. That's

when Rudy said life is no
bowl of rose, and anyway,
I'm into forgetting. Forgetting
is three of my moves.
The armature of her dismay survived
the disaster in Halifax.

It requires no polishing.

We've hung a proliferation of archaic verbs
like Christmas bulbs
along her tubes
and over the mesh-like grids. The effect

fragile as the idea of generation.
The spectacle of orange
fungus on a fallen
limb
brings back
her orangutan at Stonehenge,
the dancing, the
disturbing airs
1. Restless as a fir tree in bra
& panties.
2. Hungry as postulates in drums
of drain oil.
3. Wizened freedoms.

Her exam was camping in Idaho.
Her prevalence was an old firearm.
Her curious neck spasm belittled
the marmots into outright attack.

She stripped quickly & slipped into a pond.
The dull foliage was smeared with midges.
The coyote lifted its leg &

delivered her baptismal name.
Undone by a towel on a tray.

No family to rush celery to the cistern
or dangle plums at floating cousins.

No surprise at finding Gertrude
with spiders
was our first advantage, her tiny engine
the last.

At our discovery of adolescence
described
in a burlap diary
Vernon gave in to a seizure.

We all screamed "Mexican virus!"

His sodden towel steamed like pork tripe.
Skin graft, navel, horse-hair bow.

The mules began to bray.
He was puzzled 
and felt like glue
participating in the rich 
daughter's melancholy.

Too late to pry her snails 
from the beam.
Never poke 
yellow 
she said

or resurrect 
one's parents in 
the clutch.

Stroke 
midnight's cat tail 
and remember

ease 

is a blue valise of eggs.
After they had settled comfortably
into the rhubarb cluster
she spoke at length
while he gave the honorary member
its strokes. he wondered what

had the peeled kielbasa
to do with the outhouse glee club?
What of the tongue garbage?

She produced at that moment the last
of the pickled sow's ear.
It was clear their session
had closed. She was done with diagrams
and made a move to cover herself
with several large leaves.
I propose this between
what the Monsignor saw &
the gala lobster luncheon.

She composed at brunch
then signed his contract.

The satin of her tunic was so fine
the elbow wound
spewed a brief chablis -- clear,
& not without effervescence
in the mountain sunlight, the pure air

Her tuba had no place, nor
the simple health of crab grass.

His growth, malignant, was buried
in the corn silk
behind her ear.
Still sitting where Darrell took me
to watch jibberish grow wings

I don't feel like a sanitary landfill,
but I understand

her nerves were a basket of strings,
tangled slightly and swollen
with the milky stone

We bought a dead cloud
and stretched it out over the water bed

it got us all drunk and
now Gertrude's grown
a scrotum

come hook or crywater
I stand accused
Done with elbow wrestling
and still feeling fabulous
in the joints, she climbs over
the vegetable wreckage and proclaims:
I am the poem, I demand to be
the basket of flower eggs!

You're not a poem, he rags,
you're a busy virgin
hanging cartoon wallpaper
on an open marriage, and this
is a bent dream, a rubbery bone
I'll chew till noon!
So what if I stole your photos
of the president in bra and panties,
and fed your kitten carpet tacks,
I know you love me still -- I helped
you get the grant. I twisted

knobs on the TV when your limbs
were sore. I inflated your tire.
I even stroked your body with
the phone while your mother sobbed
and begged you to speak. And remember

the swollen zucchinis and cucumbers
I pulled out of your drawers -- they made me
feel so small. They endangered my career
in film, my mental health. Now you're
after my wealth, you say I owe you

for that operation. You claim the wart
grew back, but you don't have me fooled.
I know what you've been doing
with my hose, and so does your friend
Marlene. We think you are very strange.
She let her hair down
to the immaculate hunger

to its dirty lisp.

My eyes are supernovae and
less gentle than

she said. I'm pretending
a dark astral pussy
and talk funny too. On the edge

of appetite
and more alone

she constructed as two
mouths tunneling
a model of the multiple universe.
She let her hip slip past,
her pale wrists
rotating.

I'm no decoy
she spat,
a brush is a brush today.

And this is no religious
reverie
laced with sex
& science

this is dying fish
& crib death.

Our subscription has lapsed.
Gertrude said life is a decoy.
She said we need immersion
skills, need to know
the dreams of lichen, and the remote tickle
of symbiosis with a brick.

Still them, he shrieked, still your rife
shorebirds
before I'm moved to kill.
Out cruising for a piece
of the blame
they fell on a satchel
of stork tissue
and sold it

to a family of cistern claimants

Next they bought a bolt
of spider cotton
and employed it to entrap
a migrating
Mexican virus

A horde of piss crickets
jumped them
in an outdoor john, but Dolly
survived by pantomiming
her mother's
algae-ridden wooden bowl

Later she met a goat-footed turtle
who fitted her
for choke-mitts and quizzed
her thin syllable's
genitalia

Finally, after a meal of seltzer prunes
and potential tacos,
Dolly and the turtle guided a missle
of spleen tallow
toward the Vatican

demanding pitchblende
for Gertrude's bitter tendons.
A leap of yodel
charisma
means more to the family
than auntie's gram of companionship.

We don't need drugs to remember the day
Gertrude married the bone dowser -- it affected
our plans. Dad lost his business and Mom
took to scrawling "hornet paper" on church envelopes
She licked the flaps and stuck them to everything
including my tub raft, the woozy dutch elm and
the Mayor's fish tank.

Thankfully only Dad did time.

Thankfully several hours have passed.
Never mind the wheel chair, the floatation devices,
it's the buzzing in my marrow
that has my yodel slipping.
She went right and left at once
and we lost her. Never mind the new mattress,
it was a foul weather move, a play on our weakness.
Minutes have passed. The dowser's eyes claim
telling signals have begun to arrive. His rod
curves toward Venus. This is impossible, gripes Boris.
Next we'll be splitting photons. She's gone back
to the fuschia and there's nothing we can do.
The dowser nods and says he hears her giggling.
Skateboard trauma stretches
before the student
like a massive jungle cat

There is fear, & an awe
as foreign as wax in the brain

Figures, these arrangements
let the back-mind speak
properly

where flesh exceeds

where word is instinct & design
Consider the remote pleasures,
how they gather to invent

Remember when you trembled
for the last pear

Ask, if you will, that the sweet potato
explain itself

then prepare for the common thwart
We've been pulling
tongue, unmasking
the automatic potato.

These collisions continue,
& our major pleasure
is alluvial.

So don't say this balance
isn't classical,
don't ride your truss

down teaspoon creek.
A stable of kinetic
nomenclature is not

a petting zoo. No discount
for fools.
We drink the urban
potato
& dance
the pleistocene

Nothing soils us here

where the dampened
ball-peen
hammer

is a terminal theory of pleasure

or a swelling
in the dancer's feet
Today we compare existentialism
to the Ph.D. Think colors,
the dusty squeaks.
Think as long as february
in the Rockies, deer water, glacier.

Or what does pewter share
with a lone ovum? When next
we write home for coupons
all depends on treble phrasing and
six-legged incest. Your mother
collects herself and squeals

"Don't be mouthy now you got
your degree!"
The small, brutal captives
have evolved as
our major
concern.

We thought their formal dress
a convenient
oppression

but now what approaches
like an oily fog
to threaten
this clinical delicacy

may be described only as
Freudness Peculiar --

the classic case of mongrel duty.

We must at all costs
crush this
surly convention.

They will not be rescued
by atrocities
of denim

or the disciplines of lust.
we felt dwarfed
by wrist worship

undone by a towel
on a tray
No family of cistern
claimants

or strings of dawdle plums

no mute spiders
exchanging epics
of chemical speech
It was the engine
advantage

the happiness
that rose by mid-day

like the Mexican virus

our perfect athlete
bound North
for the St. Louis entrail
slalom
This is the story
of child greed
in the province of kohlrabi:

a crisis
of spinach fatigue.

We charged poetry with
diminishing
that young appetite
before a robbery of vegetables
took credence.

We knew seven syllables
could crush
a corn-oil rebellion,
& felt certain our honed lyric
would bridge
the sauerbraten abyss:

the lyric of yak fat
& the mud wolf,
of heavy petting & lungs
stunned by the long
slow moan
of dry leaves.

Poetry celebrates
the republic of meat.
Some people hear the words
vegetable terminus
& think of pacific collision

or skateboard trauma

Some people are puzzled
why their families
survive

why Christmas at home is elitism versu:

As poetry is able, these lines
will answer the vexing questions:

how do we recognize the karma-looter

& will we be slain?
I want to thank you for
the loaned lung
& for not pressing charges.

Karma-looting is no business
of the State.

Your friend, Sheriff Yellow
Kidney, though duly elected, is no
better than

the common thwart.

Please know that
more important than breathing
is the right to place
beaver
next to cheese.

My body is tired for the birds that have flown from me; 
Their fathomless wings are riding from my brow 
In echoes. I have finished naming now: 
They are not lost that fall by an unmapped sea. 

Twilight is home for wrens in the great oak trees 
And for the hawk that in grey caves has lain, 
The peacock, host of the rainbow after rain, 
And river swan, pearl of earth's necklaces. 

Nests are arrayed and shingled in the air 
Beneath the wandering aegis of a word 
Chosen by me. When mating calls are heard 
My poem moves in the desiring pair. 

Envied by huntsmen I numbered the animals 
Gathered from nature in my baptistery; 
The unicorn pranced, eyes arched in mystery, 
And zebras passed musing on parallels. 

I have uplifted tents within my mind 
For timeless griflins with vague wings outspread 
And serpents of the field. Even the dead 
Are sung and not to quietness resigned. 

They have all gone like music from my keeping 
Towards the named world. Left in this silent garden, 
Tired of my duties as its lonely warden, 
I seek forgetfulness at last in sleeping.
I will bring the lion under my roof, 
the fieldmouse and the timidest of hares, 
cobras, the griffin -- it exists now -- the onager, 
and wander, dying, through 
that terrible zoo. 

Then having shed through death my animals, 
as the new Adam I'll awake, 
survive that death and awake, 
the garden as a simple flower before me. 

In its wet depth I hope to see my face.
I am alone with my fish in the fishbowl, 
Getting used to fins, unused to fingers. 
Through naked stretches of the bowl we swim 
Beyond the schools. The noises of school life 
Come clinking across the water-colored pale -- 
I, towards my great fact turning, ignore. 

Oh, grey and immense, his scales hang like a wall 
Of shutters breathing to the water's lung. 
A ray of sunlight flips them into glory. 
I swim freestyle, unnoticeably small, 
And butt very gently on that flank. 

Have I stopped for long? Many hours are lonely. 
The wrinkles on my fingers near the bone. 
Yet when the light from him pours through my eyes 
A rainbow spans my dark interior 
And I linger. Some days we browse in quietness, some 
Sub specie aeternitatis paddle on.
So unhappily magnified to me, 
This man, who sees me as small 
As I see him large, 
Both looking through the same telescope 
At different ends. 
Others disparage him to me; some tear him down. 
A few, perhaps, praise me to him. 
But when at rare times we meet 
Inescapably on the lonely sidewalk 
And cannot talk, 
We edge around each other like gamebirds 
Of different species. 
And because that is so, 
The instrument will not come down for life, 
But hold to the same sharp-focussed ratio 
Our blindness towards each other.
"Honestly, sir, what good are myths?" 

(What good am I, 
that is, whose myth is "sir." 
One has to try: ) 

"Myths are the stuff that lives are made on..."

(No! Twenty faces guard their lives. 
A girl who sleeps with swans....What can you do
but lay eggs? 
Or make it real!) 

"Everybody likes to feel down? 
Feel dawn?" 

(Unsaid: "Oh perverse sir!") 

"The Trojan War, a very important war..."

(But since the Bomb there are no wars no more, 
only athletic contests.... 

I'VE GOT IT, my mustardseed of faith: 
I'll flap my hands and fly! 

God! What a feat! Better than airplanes! 
Floating here with my teaching finger out 
like Gabriel!) 

"This is the way it is! You're living a miracle! 
Let's start a new world here!" 

(But no again. They'd shoot me down, my hunters. 
It says to in the handbook.) 

"Mr. Jones, that was a very searching question. 
Honesty is the best paucity."
He offered himself as game for women's hands 
If they could lay to bulls that kind of straying 
Idly beyond the reasonable fence and the square bull pasture 
Towards the river side. He stopped their playing, 
Made them fall back astonished by the sand 
As, unforeseen, his gentleness alarmed. 
Then, in fear of heightening their fear, 
He paused and wonder danced alone in the air between. 
His lung was quickened presently by a girl 
Bolder than all the rest, sidling with laughter towards him. 
But for the river she was all that moved, 
A plait of flowers in her hand, desire in her limbs 
For motion in the pattern of a dance 
And the heaviness of strange intent about her. 
Is there a heart not gathered by faint swaying, 
This way, this way, accompanied by laughter? 
Far within the circles of his body awakening 
And moving at first outwards came the bull. 
He tapped once, bowed his head and tapped again 
As if to shake off springs of violence, 
Then sank, for his great body was allayed 
Partly and without malice he gazed there. 
Soon the cowering girls made a ring about him; 
Europa set her wreath upon his horns. 
A silence fell that gave voice to the river 
And the chapped rush of leaves. Then with a sigh, 
As the Europa in each girl was loosed
To a corporeal rhythm, dance began. 
Figures insinuated by desire 
Flashed forth, evoking mushroom agonies 
Or little wildernesses of turmoil 
In the surprised beholder. Yet the dance 
Trimmed their incipient fire to pattern still. 
And the quiet music was answered by the bull 
Only with breathing and abstracted eyes. 
They were displeased by so much darkness garnered 
Slothfully there and longed to see it rise. 
Some struck him as they passed with whips of scarves 
And some threw flowers. At last Europa dropped 
Upon his back and stroked the glacial hide, 
With her moist hands exploring pallid folds. 
He could not bear the weight of that last garland 
And all the impositions on his mood 
By careless girls. He roused himself, therefore, 
Out of the invisible chains of simple being 
And joined them, moving faster as they moved 
Until his foot was light with that sweet dancing. 
But they are often slain who play with darkness 
Or left behind near the original ground 
Raising bruised fingers toward a blind ascension. 
The bull, aflame, sprang for the water. Cries 
Rebounded as if laughter struck blank walls 
And the disheartened ring of virgins, flower 
By its own beauty spoiled, fell back and broke. 
Then they came together, as we see them here, 
Trailing along the distant water's edge 
Like the shucked petals of a ripened tale.
Clutching a horn, as her part taurine gown 
Already mingles, chosen Europa rides. 
The bull has leaped at once through sky and water 
To harmonize with that which most dissolves; 
He pulses toward fulfillment on a groundswell, 
Followed by what the stewpots of the sea 
Exhale: a fish flecked with the primal sunlight, 
Runnels of foam. Love's bedfellows are here, 
Planing the unforgettable blue in chubby disarray, 
Their arrows bathed in Alpine clarity. 
It is the seed-time of myth, strewing and passing over; 
As in an hourglass when the sand drops free 
The future spreads inexorably. Onward, 
Where shafts of rock hoist the aspiring wave, 
A couch is set; within an open meadow 
A tentative cradle waxes in its tree.
If Venus rose from the sea, then who am I? 
For such a womb to stop at one 
would be to nature's derogation -- 
and so I think we all rise from the sea, 
separate and sisterly, 
combing in the tidiness of fashion 
here on the beach of time, and every 
woman is a wave, a slower wave.
Once there was a boar hunted by all. 
Though some tempered spears and stayed at home 
and others baked bread for those who went along, 
staying at home themselves, 
everybody in his heart was hunting. 

The boar was never taken, 
but ran in his wounds through the woods perpetually 
(I hear him running through those woods today, 
grunting and goring.) 

There are many ways to hunt: the bravest 
get in among the still points of the spears, 
that woods within a woods where the boar is 
at the kill,

(though a kill never happens; 
for what is the great body loping through 
far glades of trees but the boar still? 
There is at best only a resurrection 
with all the bravest asleep round the new boar.) 

The cowards make passes at the boar from afar 
and write the poetry of hunting. 

A few, it is said, turn from blood though pressed 
even by their own blooded hearts' unrest, 
and when the bakers bake, the slughorns blow, 
they neither spin nor sow.
Sparrows were lassoed by ironic eras, 
Bundled with trees and breezes in the barn 
Of sentimental stock. They're always with us, 
Though, as the whole world to the palest stone 
Is with us, moving out its life or death 
Mysteriously beyond the equals sign. 
How did they fly? Were holes a last resort, 
A doubt left in the fabric of our barn? 
For surely sparrows punctuate our lines 
Again and breezes merit praise for blowing. 

One can deny man's captions, not the thing 
That they're attached to; little sparrows arched 
Their bodies with a flair in hostile eras 
And sallied through imaginary walls 
Like scornful ghostlings. Even the bumptious air 
Shatters our meaning with variety. 
Blake had it, You must kiss them as they fly -- 
Or miss them. Lacking minds, perhaps, they live 
Out there, companions in transience, live and thrive; 
One that's denied will batten in your dreams.
The tiger is foliage and the foliage tiger. 
If you strolled into him, you would, of course, 
Find out what continent you were strolling in. 
The tiger is foliage and the foliage tiger. 

But camouflage is the tiger's pocket fortress, 
More to ward off while he sleeps in the sun 
Than to engage. At night his eyes burn forth; 
But camouflage is the tiger's pocket fortress. 

He thrives more by alchemy than vigor, 
Pawing dead leaves to powder when they lie 
Between him and his prey. Old tigers lose 
Their vigor to the alchemy of pawing. 

His final spring dispersed along lianas, 
His body to the leaves, his growl to air, 
The hunter finds dead tiger everywhere, 
Dispersed along the longest of lianas.
The day I was eaten 
began warmly under mother as usual. 
They called me a fool 
to go from there to breakfast 
unafraid. 
My way's my way. 

It was a decent calfhood, 
the sleeping and eating part. 
Before I had a chance at sex with gnus 
a tiger deflowered me 
by the throat. 

Well, that's life 
and this is afterlife 
in the head of a man 
who's playing with my name. 
He has to look me up 
in a book, of course, 
to see if tigers really do it 
to gnus. 

I can't complain: 
a little pleasure, a little fear, 
one big event, 
and then to have done with it. 
In my will is my peace.
Now stretch pale fibers of the day again 
And the vast weaving that the sun betrays 
Is lying open to the winter rain. 
All color is an echoing of greys 
Half danced to by the jagged evergreens. 
The field's impassioned flowers have fought the sting 
Of the cold long ago. A mandrake leans 
In a locked swamp, the ice's overhang. 
Shadows toward night grow till they loop the world. 
The curved blade of their East cuts one by one 
Dark patterns on the landscape. Soon the cold 
Of light will tunnel through the air alone 
And men will know how little can satisfy, 
Watching a lonely star possess the sky.
I am the animal inside my body, 
the healthy and knowing squirrel 
in a forest of malignancy. 
When will the trees lower their mosses? 
I want a clearing far from their ill sap! 
Oh, if they hurt me 
I can get smaller, 
smaller than the fingers of their evil. 
My name is Enid.
Herohood's out of reach 
for the old indispensable octopus crying 
"Bring me my telephones!" 
But on the sly we love his virtues. 

He's always at work among his neighborhoods 
at the bottom of the sea, 
which through his alien way become less strange. 

He's always at work 
and we, whose day must take 
its underwater leap towards evening, 
watch his joy. 

It's like the joy of those we envy, 
the lovers and pilgrims 
and the train buffs 
holding hands on the good excursion: 
"Here we are in what we know so well!" 

In the vacation of his character 
he has all this without a journey. 

Who is he?
The skin of this peach is drawn 
back in zigzags; in that 
a baby Charybdis 
of rot twists down 
towards the peachstone 
lazily. At 3', 
5", the table bears 
five oranges, one splitting 
(like the peach), two pears and room 
for more food. 
                      Across the room 
a girl, sexy, legs crossed, 
intense as an animal, 
has her skirt played with by 
sunrays. On her finger 
is a small diamond that recalls your mind.
The used water pulls around his ankles 
and backs off toward the hole 
for what's not wanted in his world. 
And he has come this far, dripping and clean, 
an otter without wound. 

Now the cold white sheets and the white night 
printed for the last time with the Text, 
its frayed edges glowing into color. 

He chants his eighteen lines in a still tongue 
and with the hypnotizing of his fear 
sleep comes.
A girl who had fallen among Christians 
tired of good Peter, good William, good Paul, 
the Old Faithful of the Sunday social, 
and sat above her long legs travelling 
to Babylon. 

But it was a little Babylon, 
slow and remote, 
and she had ripened too long on the wrong tree, 
a fruit too dark now for the calm arrangement 
of a pagan garden. 

And so this ibis of a girl, this gift given 
over and over to itself, returned 
to the small town, 
where each night when the stars shine, 
from her childless room an answer 
phosphoresces.
No one to referee that game, 
Poor fledglings, with their heads thrown back 
And mastered hips joined to their shame, 
Are lonely partners on the rack. 

Who is that watchman of the night, 
Stretched out, staring so vacantly 
From his filled bed until the light 
Of day permit activity? 

And who lies breathing at his side, 
In sleep a kind of ruffed grouse? 
Is it the girl that neatly glides 
About the duties of her house? 

They married decent strangers; she 
For images of his despair 
Without her, for his good name; he 
For guilt and the curling of her hair. 

Yearly to interpose delight 
They go upon their honeymoon 
Again, where things are never quite 
The same although they should be soon. 

And a small cottage has sprung up 
Near a favorite swimming cove; 
Every summer they come up 
To localize their straying love. 

On starry nights after their meal 
Old rituals of hand in hand 
Begin and what they think they feel 
Makes them lie upon cool sand. 

So they tumble by that shore 
Of the uncaring upland lake 
As if it were not done before 
And each moans for the other's sake.
A fingertip, an earlobe, any hair 
Led to the open country of love, my dear; 
And we knew all the ports and all the countries. 
But did we know our bodies' 
Silent, peripheral, and other life 
That pushes warts to light, withdraws them after 
Like rock-faces in a primal sea? 
It was that life, perhaps, gave you to me 
Or me to you... 
                                           No matter: 
Part of ourselves swam the same turbid water 
And walked for a while the selfsame tropic land. 
But as one forgets in time which arm was sprained, 
Which finger cut, or which hand had the wart, 
So we forgot the travelling lover's art 
And stayed home in ourselves although together.
Reading the scholarly notes on vanished places, 
Hebron and Babel, the mirror to lilacs, 
And Athens, its stone piled upon old stone, 
There danced antique young men about my mind 
And girls whose hands caught by a sculptor's hand 
Turned into flowers waved for a thousand years 
That stranger girls could match them with their own. 

And when the scholars wrote of soldier mummies 
Like walnuts in their undecaying biers 
With all their flails and arrows rusting near, 
The imagination of my sex was stirred 
By wasted concubines longing for princes, 
Who decked themselves in veils and chaplets for 
The delectation of a rival's eye. 

Seeking the regent of the voiceless wood 
At Versailles in the fall was reading too -- 
Another style of wandering down paths 
Not scythed by my own hand. The king was hidden 
Beyond the renewing green of his domain; 
He caroused elsewhere with the Greek girls and boys, 
The warriors and forgotten concubines. 

Yet all danced in that absence, even stone: 
Unlike the absence which avoids my text, 
Hardly ferried across dividing waters 
By note or snapshot. Now I must be one 
Who goes at guilt-time home to a bare hearth 
And a processional of empty rooms 
Unfolded to the dying of my smile.
The youngest son is riding on the plain; 
Mother is A the last cow at the stalls: 
"A week at most and seven dragons slain 
To fill the niches of ancestral halls," 
He murmurs, counting merrily as he rides, 
"And if some dragons fail to block my way, 
Why then lost virgins will or lonely brides: 
God, who makes youngest sons, will make the fray', 

Somehow, a land away, the roads are longer 
And noble girls are chary of their sins. 
Upon a brown mule, beggar-eyed with hunger, 
Past rain-pocked statues of St. George, past inns 
Whose rational keepers brook no free abiding, 
The eldest son is riding, riding, riding.
Some men gradually begin seeing diamonds 
as the world champions in staying power, 
men of talent, men of sweetness, 
who start off very well in the living kingdom. 
What they don't have is 
mind enough for choosing 
between good and good. 
And so their choices 
erode their characters. 
Before they grow too weak in the flowering, 
dying human world, they make 
one last hard choice 
to put their faith in diamonds. 
Then all the decisions are made forever 
by Talmudic Jews in Amsterdam 
with telescoping monocles 
and chisels like the Lord's on Sinai.
FIRST OFFICER

"He appears in strange territories boldly 
And eyes the bulging tribute pouches coldly, 
Our young snake of an imperator, Max. 
First, the recusant pagans to the ax 
('We're all Romans here. We know what's what!'), 
Then a Forum, a Colosseum and all that. 
But all that civilization's after us: 
We're at the brunt of things with Max the Glorious!" 

SECOND OFFICER

"Freedom lies over the edge of expectation. 
Caesar is free. Such dark paths he can choose from! 
With their brains dimly glowing to prevent falls, 
Most people daily waddle where the flesh calls. 
Caesar, like inexorable bone, 
The grim geometry of the skeleton, 
Underlies things. His will cuts scruple like a razor. 
Others obey the law of not being Caesar." 

THIRD OFFICER

"He alone is pointed to by the past. 
Old men who remember oldtime Caesars nest 
Trembling among friends or thumb the archives 
While stranger bees invade the golden hives. 
And after, when the farms darken, who dares 
Suggest the grain be sifted from the tares? 
Old wisdom is not wanted; one is wise 
To make a sheath of words for Caesar's policies." 

SECOND OFFICER

"Like an idea Caesar is everywhere 
And men, as rational animals, think it; here 
On the northern border and in the desert town 
Or bedded with their virgin wives at Rome. 
He's master of each village, seen, unseen, 
And trees for thousands of miles over the horizon. 
No matter what he does, all buildings remain 
Sunning within his empire, from India to Spain." 

FIRST OFFICER

"Contradictions, if bold, prove him to us 
Like victories. We move to the subtle choice 
Of countermarch as to attack. And rout 
Itself is but the heavens reaching out 
To touch him like an oak in a thunderstorm. 
Of course, too many defeats and the hoods come 
With their unanswerable knives and thongs, 
But Max rations defeat as garnish for our songs." 

THIRD OFFICER

"He will be stabbed someday by a retainer, 
One of the scarred kind, an old soldier 
And family man, upon whose arm he rested 
His own in foul times, one whose love he wasted, 
Being careless to inflict the private grief 
Which cuts through love an opening for the knife."
Only from our point of view, as masters of the table, 
does the eater of crumbs glow with a terrible 
                loveliness. 
He clings to our pity like a bat, 
certainly. And a few, independent of the prince, 
think that disgusting, our table his rafter. 
They miss the light in his face when we bowl him 
                the crumb. 
For a moment he sees it with the fullest glance, a baby's 
his crumb without compare. 
There is nothing else in the world but its hollows, 
                its rims, 
bounding dreamily over the tablecloth like sagebrush. 
From a distance he drinks the shadows in, facet by facet, 
and swells. 
What a pleasure to hear us, the masters, counting -- two, ah, 
three 
until, lovingly, it's his!
A secret I know about China, 
huge and twitching land of rumor 
and cloud mountain, goes: 
After a thousand years of news 
from the press invented there 
and speeches for that press, the polls 
as slow and sure as quicksand 
drank all history down 
and left only story, like the villain's hat, 
afloat on the foam.
Work at making less to touch 
of yourself and of things. 
More against nakedness than anyone, 
live in skins up to the nostril 
held open still for breathing. 

Very little happens on horizons you watch, 
though sometimes in a corner the newborn 
scapegoat gets to suck or suck twice. 
When you hear of it, 
sense the old stakeout in your body -- 
everything new wants to nest in you -- 
and pave everywhere to keep the life down.
So many wreaths and trees are hostages 
For the withdrawing spirit. Even the jails 
Are covered with them and the station houses 
Twinkle in boughs and bulbs a festive welcome. 
Where are the children merciful enough 
To say they believe in Santa still? I watched 
His vicar shot at by a ten-year-old 
Armed with a toy ballistic missile launcher. 
I laughed, of course -- one cannot choose but laugh 
And ride the loaded escalator down. 

So many old distractions are at hand 
To grace the time. Widows beguile the lunch hour 
By decorating ledges on the airshaft 
And in the park mild, city-loving deer 
Are fed popcorn by priests. 
                                          Silence surrounds 
All the pieties of this gone world 
Laid out in spangles under a cold sky. 
The city bears its unconnected sorrows, 
From furnished rooms where egg nog watchers sleep, 
Old men shepherding their loneliness, 
To houses of the merry gentlefolk 
Before which coeds sing of Bethlehem.
Here is the highway of dead birds, 
the hopeless dodging animals. Skunkbloom, 
that is the last defense, the finest; 
a small broken body is the other, 
though sometimes it's unholy length of dog 
dead sideways two three four, 
the legs in the air the horror. 

And this is the highway of from here to there, 
route such and such intestate, 
clean for the most part, nothing in between 
except the foursquare talking in the car 
and the foursquare watching silence, covered over 
by the car's baked metal skin. 

And so we have two worlds, one out, one in, 
dying to cross each other.
The hospital rises in a foursquare void; 
North, east, west, south, the flowers are down, 
Varieties of afternoon birds flown; 
If bats litter the sky, the sky is a bat, 
The hospital glowing brokenly through its wings. 

Elsewhere is breathing and the darker functions 
Valve and unvalve in darkness and the sea moves 
Sowing its clams under the world's foreskin; 
Shells prey upon shells and empty them -- 
But that is backhanded life and of the void. 

Yes, other stone remains in the watchman's hand 
And though the restaurants have given up, 
Leaving their Maginot Line of chairs to the night, 
The sun will waken on a brickwork shoulder. 
For the eye of dawn things will spread out, 
Tower and flower, whatever is in hiding, 
The watchman lose the familiar room again, 
His table, chair, and lunchpail to the light -- 
He will lose the burden of keeping it all together. 

Now we are wires between abundant charges, 
From sun to sun: the nurse who plots the line 
Declining on the fever chart towards morning, 
While she patrols her corridor of wounds, 
The watchman, and the watcher...If we snap? 

Far away on Blue Hill, above twigs and brambles 
And quiet pressed lairs, 
Rises the cleft observatory, the knife in its heart -- 
All night the exposure festers forth new stars.
These days the sunlight almost seems total. 
A few men, trees, stand between heaven and earth. 
In the light of their shadows we others are 
        reading, still, 
messages the dead have stopped sending, 
these days of almost fatal sunlight.
As suburbs are the rings of hearkening 
To the great city's cry, so is this hood 
That has been thrown about me, although rude, 
Yet the impatient caping of my spring. 
I cannot tell what the ripe year will bring 
When it flees haunted on before these crude 
First sessions of despair, nor what the lewd 
And ghost-tainted brain will learn to sing. 
But if by nightly forays in the world 
Of pictures that a childhood stored away, 
By charting the transparent lands that lie 
Between the cedar trees, one thought is whirled 
Into an action that outlasts its day, 
My shadow wears the stone it passes by.
Before this hour is pried by the hawk's wing 
Rising from its grey nest above the lawns 
And shades of the lifting day, early to fling 
A furrow in the sun and cleave our songs 
Apart from the strong and heartless not our own, 
I would hurl nets of cries into the air 
To wind the hawk in flight that he drop down, 
Himself prey to this questioning, this fear: 
"Before the roofs fly from our shallow hells 
And there is green fire that unties the pen 
With flowering of the flesh in syllables 
To pilfer each thing from its foxes den, 
0 hawk, we must make whole what you have torn -- 
What womb must we sleep in to be reborn?"
The rain, oscilloscoping, heels the roses 
Clinging like suicides to the stalk, but most 
Have fallen petalwise to dissolution. 
Through the stripped maples ads deceive again 
And streetcars roll. The garden is shrinking now 
Into the piecemeal absence cold requires, 
With canvas over the fountains and the birdbath. 
Winter is a drugged suitcase in my attic 
And a leap in time. Soon mantles will be shaken, 
All gardens lie in pantherskins of snow 
And six more weeks be gone. Small things lose force; 
The grass itself flags in the general dying. 
I'd not be stung by honeybees here, posting 
Shock from head to toe again and again. 

It is the tawny season 
When enviable climates warm the mind -- 
Blue skullcaps over the twofold Thebaid. 
In Greece "come, come into the desert" sang 
The sainted birds who catered to the spring 
Of Laius, and in Egypt holy men 
Ignored the foliage of metropolis. 

What were they seeking on the thirsty margin 
Of fire? Was it forty days as one 
For a good look at God? I am sick with time 
And shrink within this bandage of a room 
From where innumerable changing gardens stretch 
To the desert sun. Navel of my desire: 
The windowpane's smug water exiles me 
From the dissolving seasons and the dry.
When darkness had snubbed to sleep even Bruce the Wild,
I oiled my face and hands against night life 
And went outside. In the wet air stars shone 
Like flies wiping their forelegs. It was pleasant 
To patrol slowly through hemlocks rising from sand 
Here and there in the catlike stillness. Chaired, 
Afterwards, in great roots above the ground, 
I read Jane Austen with a flashlight pen. 
But long, feminine mosquitoes coming in 
To my English estate in the Maine woods 
Made me break off. 
                               A whippoorwill slung volleys 
From the back brush as I walked the next patrol. 
I wanted human trespass, though; jailed gardens, 
Fireside cats and dogs, the city...
I foraged beyond my itching summer body 
When the eelgrass near my shoe gave him away. 

The mole was young, but huffed as he climbed over 
His mound; and it was there that I caught him, 
Closing the neutral box of my hands around -- 

Then my hands, turning human, closed around me.
The slightly deformed waitress in black rayon 
And white cuffs wanted me or the Arab page, 
Melmel. Our fantail boss, doling the pay on 
Thursdays, remembered when he was my age 
And worked for less. All's well at the hotel 
Still, I'm sure. The Methodist minister 
Rents room and radio for the double-header 
On Sunday afternoons. As when Eve fell 
The snake slid down the tree, our elevator 
Pimp descends counting from an upper floor. 
I have escaped them; all's well that ends well. 

Yet, sometimes, I catch myself in looking back 
To that sad hive, to the Arab, to the boss squawking 
At Jean, our waitress...
                                   I've seen her in the park 
Where Vs widen as paved walks meant for walking.
Yesterday, after twenty years 
Schools, businesses, and wars, 
I met my wrestling partner Bert 
B. He was the boy who taught 
The nelson, half and full, to the grammar school. 
But Bert was no fool; 
He kept tricks in his bag. I tried, 
And when "Uncle" was cried for, I cried, 
Holding out longer if girls were there. 
He is a bull now. I am a bear; 
Neither wants to talk for long -- 
But, yesterday, in a glance it seemed 
Our little lost bodies sprang 
Toward sweat and the mat again.
That was wings too, 
like everything not rigid, 
everything between two 
people or a people and its city 
or a cloud and its sky. 

The dentist and I 
worked my teeth for half a year, 
the New Boston rising from its pad 
outside our window. 
And as he drilled deeper 
the development reached higher 
and I grew older 
until all was capped with gold: 
his fee, the sky, 
the stumps that lined my jaw, 
that aching row. 

I am complete now 
though the city is still changing. 
I miss the man 
whose intelligence 
lay wholly in his competence, 
all clouded beside. 
Such friendships end 
when the skill that called them up has run 
its course.

Everything human has wings 
(better to name it that than decay) 
and flies toward an inevitable future: 
a city, a body, warmth between two men; 
everything has its day -- except, 
of course, my golden crowns.
From a chamber behind my eyes drops the word "Treasure", 
born of irony out of longing, 
a word without friends in a Spartan world. 
It lies here, outshining the erasable 
bond, the yellow obstetric pencil. 
I have the heart to kill it 
and say, "Aw cmon, word, die! 
Go back, il mio tesoro, if you can't die, 
to the literature that owns you." 

But I know how it is, even on this page, with babies -- 
one wordless day 
I'll find myself becoming grateful.
Out of the strummed nerves of getting by 
I come to where the wall is. 
Squirrels tunnel against it under the ivy. 
I know where the bricks are without winter to show me. 
The sky, too thin for nerves, too simple to be a man, 
spreads over it; 
but everything I call the world stops here. 

Back in my life, when objects failed, I moved them 
like a young chessplayer winning through 
to the bright outside of fame 
by moving his old furniture about. 
Here the wall is, 
old, and new -- immoveable. 

Another world, mysterious wood or holy city, 
stretches its fingertips of tower and twig 
on the far side. 
Men and women who walk through stone have reached it. 
Can I? 

If so, I would have the wall still rising behind me 
like the sober heart of a story that ends well. 
There is enough left in me of the good Jew 
to need a wall somewhere to come back to.
A strange seduction. 
I find myself a young man 
in my father's habit, 
his old browsing eternity 
with the news. 

All of it feeds me -- 
the sports and the comics, 
the front page with its many graves, 
editorials, 
horse-blinders and loss. 

When we were in this life together 
I read like an educated man.
Almost a child again, grown from wading, 
I walk past the end of your life 
where it clearly stops.
The best of what they say means 
"You've got the steel ball 
that we had." 
Hardly a word more that's right, 
as if to describe 
something so round 
and so around 
were impossible. 

I've got the aching steel ball. 
Oh I've got it 
to come on or be come on by 
each day while it grows small. 

Keeping faith, 
I approach the ball as a kind of life 
whose feeling I now hold 
in trust, waiting somehow. 

Where is eternity? I am looking.
In a room I was getting used to 
I found in dust beneath the couch 
a microscopic hunting horn 
I lost as a child. 
(It is my luck to find the things I need 
exiled from where I lost them.) 
Dust, gentle dust, 
coated from my eyes the horn rungs 
and stopped, an ageing hill, the mouth of the horn. 

I reached down, but my fingers would not take it 
as they sloped like pagodas over it. 
My eyes began to blur. 
And now the couch is back, corner on corner. 

Inviolable dust, 
there seemed, as always in your little worlds, 
a chance to set out again through deserts.
It seems the corridors of my childhood 
live behind me and shrink as living people: 
the one at grammar school I stumbled down 
alone during classhour, sick to my stomach, 
it was a kind of endless Karnak 
as I wound my arms around a pillar 
and said, "I will remember this forever," 
noting within my nausea. 

It's there, unfairly small, 
as our assembly hall is there 
with its picture, "The British Burning Buffalo." 
Each of the colors is an orphan 
now that I've grown, seen Turner and Renoir. 

But can all this be so 
in the gradual world of villages? 
Few leave to be surprised at a dog's growth 
on their return, or a field of trees -- 
the sadness of losing out from watching. 
And death diminishes like the road from town.
With many hills around us and tall trees 
nearer to the rain, we always 
feel our nakedness is special. 

Somewhere my name is on a death, 
but whether it sits sunning among fruit 
and fruit decay 
or canters like a nightmare behind me, 
I hardly know. 

And the best that I can do 
is always to feel death as an ambience, 
caring, but not hurrying my feet 
though the warrant-laden sky 
should, like a parent, find me.
because there is always craft 
I have not looked you in the face. 

What am I to do with 
what I cannot understand, 
the ground and the brook and the tears in my eyes? 
Not to have been born 
is the best friend 
of the pure particular places. 

My hand's as good as any toad; 
the different flashes of my clothes 
go with the grass -- 
something to touch is not the bigot. 
What am I to do with 
what I distill, 
an anger in the breathing? 
How can I narrow further to the saying? 

When I'm working I see the grass most clearly, 
the orange alder root at home 
in tough bourgeois 
possession of the soil, 
and, after nights of rain, 
gentle mud laminating the ditches.
The elements I have by heart 
are stone and water. 
Happy the poets with all four! 

I buy and grow 
and sleep with my collection, 
take inventory too: 

And then, for any day, 
a bug climbing a brick is, 
with the right hold of my mind, 
Sinon climbing the walls of Troy 
or the hero, on all fours, over 
the pit in Haggard's She.

I am afraid to see my life this way, 
though every year 
like Actaeon I mislay the fear 
at times out of time 
that strangely devour and leave one. 

The bug goes on with his instinct 
over the brick the seasons wear, 
with hours enough to get a life in.
I am here 
rowing backward from my poems 
and the poems of others. 
Goodbye. How could I stay 
at the dock of their homecoming? 
I row from summer 
with its flickers and cold stoves 
on the long pull. 

Behind me the abyss 
thunders around its parched 
coinspace of an eye. 
Perhaps the coin is stamped 
with a first noun. 

I will row home 
when the shore is strange enough.

Forgetfulness is the pool 
with no buoyancy. 
I have come that far in it. 
There is neither night 
nor twilight, but an obscure

row of days 
like the questions 
that lift 
from a sleepy mouth.

"What happened?" 
"Was it a wild throw 
into the trees?"

Let us have 
aluminum 
and the radio on it, 
the honey light 
and cellophane 
of shallow music.

Through streaked windows: 
a large slow branch, 
the neighbor's 
emerald lawn. A voice 
comes up the stairs 
and turns a homey corner

"Do I love that?"

The mirror across the room 
holds a crescent of hair, 
a nose, and an eye's dark well. 
I do not feel the hand 
that surfaces to confirm,
nor the one that comes 
to stroke the hair, 
to push me down with love.
Too late, the light is like talcum on the hills, 
the morning rush like last night's crowd 
at the stadium, two miles away 
and spilling into the neighborhood. 
Thus I touch the world, saying "too late" 
when I mean "probe," when I fool myself 
into "probe" and mean "mirror." The hills
are just a clock, and the light 
its intimate hands. I am jealous 
of them for being there, for 
making me take this way to them.
It makes me a bus 
from the airport by the sea 
going to a house by the sea. 
For comfort, I condemn 
everyone to be that bus, 
to grasp anything 
that resembles home.
It was a romance with brick: each brick an island, a dome, reefs 
and archipelagos of porous brick, and between them the gray 
mortar, like low-slung clouds within the rise and fall of brick. 
Then, abruptly, like the crack of a frozen lake, the fluid yard 
found its boundaries.
    Every doorway had its crazy niche, locked thighs that crumbled 
in spring's sweaty dew; every window its tableau, with full-
bodied death crushing a maiden's breasts, his tongue driving into
bone.
    At last the trees obscure the street.  The city is crazed with 
renovation.  All night I hear jackhammers, sludge-pumps, the slap
of lumber, trowels rasping.  Stairways cover the old cliffs. One
crisp morning the blue-print rises, dovecote within dovecote,
beautiful graph through which the laughter rattles.
A man rises with his thoughts 
like slant-light 
through hemlock and spruce, a screen 
through which a distant highway 
comes as sea-sound, 
then the tin trumpets 
of seabirds, who are just children 
a few houses down, playing 
so they all touch somehow. The roof
overhead collapses into the next 
through shadow, the white siding of each house 
still more blue-gray than the glaring separateness 
of a few hours from now. But already 
a woman has found
sun on a soft-edged dais 
between him and the children, has removed 
a watch he puts on, has slipped off rings 
he now replaces, and lets go this small gold mound 
where her hand relaxes and curls. He is lost 
and drowsy in the light of oleanders in a glowing vase, 
the conversation between closed eyes 
and bones surrendered to the earth. He receives
this body which floats to him 
on different nights, for the houses look 
as if he'd just placed them: pure titanium on ultramarine. 
He's made her all one color. 
The pale bands 
of jewelry vanish 
into triangles of sand, lapses of sky
that lead where roads are ocean-bound,
where neither of them lives
but where they grope for a place,
their hands one anchor.
*
My bride is distant 
along diagonals of www. Her white dress 
burns out the little sticks 
of a country icon, and the dress 
and a window's lights battle at burning. 
I am unfocused, uncomfortable
in a line of chairs along a wall.
The back of my neck 
rubs splinters of cedar, 
vaguely needing this comfort. Not needed, 
the fireplace roars. I send an occasional song 
and she answers with a word 
that arrives hollow within her voice. 
I leave it before me, turning to see 
who comes down the line: her thin double, 
glowing and aged, and whose hair 
is both blond and gray. Her lips
brush each face on the line, and as she nears, 
her whispering dress mocks that of my bride. I am kissed 
on the mouth. She, mother of the bride, 
leans forward again, drains me, 
each kiss no longer 
but claiming like fire. Her face 
withdraws but does not leave. It's the cabin 
that recedes, the window 
a pale blue space, a young bride its cloud. 
This hand in mine 
is wet in a cold stream, is a third bride 
who comes down a formality of rock and water, 
flowered crown first, her frothy white dress
smoothed by the current. I am snagged
with her, cold as water, 
and the kiss is long.
In winter, the fires in oil drums 
are like the crone's voice 
repeating a child's complaint.

In our search for a likeness 
we have come to these endless stoops 
where men and women are hunched

over the red domes, fallen 
like the stone finials behind them. 
We see her features

scattered among them -- brother, cousin, 
the child...but our hope 
is the white parabola above each fire,

where there is no threshold 
for warmth, just ice 
in the lungs, as when one

turns from the drum for the door. 
Now smoke complicates dusk 
in the east, and evening

is a cafe on the dog-leg 
of a twisted summer; under 
its close roof

is a nakedness that drinks
the after-image of fire.
How stupid to startle the family
from the threshold of sleep, to shatter
one's own face in a window
with night behind it. The moment
has the heaviness of lacquer --
these wraiths in nightgowns and goosebumps,
and then her voice, low and solitary.

Why do shoes fit tightly
on these occasions? One is carried
to exhaustion on concrete, surprised
by the train whistle, the pungent ballast,
a coach brought to one
like a notch in roulette. Into the seat,
into a half-sleep, night left ajar
and the hard black cases
pressing into their thighs. Later, in the suit
of concerts and death,
he would pierce the first formal silence
and the other would follow, hearing
how she came to him with a gesture of grace
so like the dusting of her skirts; how the wet-nurse
became "mama," moulding little mouths
to her breasts. Mama had a way with secrets,
a way to turn them into orange blossoms,
and the wet nurse would press them
into the leaves of her simple dreams,
injuring him in this double affection. Often,
they stare into the bell of the trumpet,
into a vortex of night and trains,
until one or the other
makes his reflection on its rim.
When he's sick, she gets sick, 
but before that, neighbors heard 
his voice, like the hammers 
of a dead piano, beating down breath 
on her, and before that, acacia blossoms 
floated down the aqueduct, with pink toes 
dappling them, and hands with cigarettes 
writing them down, imagining Balzac or Zola 
fishing with their pinkies, as they did 
prior to this, two hard at the game, crayons 
of the past melting in the same bed, 
where the brass turtle on a square of marble 
bore its flute and incense and rattled 
to the edge, useless evermore, though the same 
had happened in the beginning, when in passion 
he struck his heel on the turtle's back, 
bled on carpet and her white calves, then 
licked them clean and made the turtle whole.
Once again I misread. "Be violet," 
I thought he said. Well, he must be sick and drinking, 
the piss-color, amber, bronze, mahogany, 
the strongest things 
kept at the height of his shoulder. 
For he has no doubt been pushed 
into a chair of those colors. By fever, by draining 
three fingers of scotch, by the window 
whose pale wash trembles with children. What is 
one tremble? Half of it? "Here, take my daughter," 
says someone of the woman 
watching the children. Maybe that. 
What is glass 
but what undresses her and is not jealous. 
The intermediary, hearing grapes 
fall to the floor, is obligated to hear rain. 
Maybe that is violet.
Through the plate glass, the blue shadows 
of her pink flesh 
travel over her 
like huge Luna moths, 
or like the dark curls 
at the base of fire, which suddenly, 
but with complete transition, become pale 
smoke.
This is the angel he reaches for 
in the smoke from a broiler, numerous flies 
buzzing through the smoke and around him, 
two doors off their hinges.
                       The meat cooks 
and he must remake the house 
in these odors, in light that clings 
as for a man in the south, whose angel 
is born of creosote and magnolias, and travels swiftly 
to anvil-shaped clouds. Our man,
for whom my map has no home, must finish 
the cookout, must see the afternoon 
through to night, put everyone to bed, then press 
the heels of his palms into his eyes.
Somewhere on the hard finish of this shell,
deep in the tightest curls
toward beginning, is the evening light
like afterthoughts on beginning: traffic as mirage,
complex, disregarded for one fluid line, the closed car.

"Are we going back," she asks.
"Is there darkness back," he asks, for that was the start,
and it is like two arrows repeating, demonstrating.

So the room is dark,
and though they are not
alabaster models, this body
can see that body -- just enough,
like opposite walls in the last curve out,
the shell losing hollowness.

The spiral
is inside itself,
spiraling to know itself,
or known through a sudden cross-section
at a daylight cafe, where there is nothing
on the table, and no one across.

*

You lean toward the city
        and crane
around one of its tilting steps, like a spectator
who looks too closely and overshoots, losing a familiar
figure in the city's bas relief.

She would urge you
to leave that glint of ocean
that appears through parted boards, to look
around for her presence.
              So small is emotion
you see only promise in its rack,
her figure a small flame
dancing on a ramp of dank boards,
enthralled in the byway whose scent is algae,
remnants of tissue,
the mussel's faint breath.
                  You waver
between two levels: the last 
which steps into water, and the lowest 
trickles of crepuscular shops, where you enter, translucent
as wax or shell, a slave darkness
untended,
          its proprietor lost 
as you are lost in the final slump of waterfront,
snug in a wing's hard crook,
            the shell curve
            that leads heart after sight.
These Antipodes call to one's mind
old recollections of childish doubt and wonder.
Only the other day I looked forward to this airy barrier
as a definite point in our journey homewards;
but now I find it, and all such resting places for the imagination,
are like shadows, which a man moving onwards cannot catch.

-from Darwin's Voyage of the Beagle
The dogs do not move today 
and the tallest trees are limp. 
There's a white film on the broad leaves 
of the cottonwood that a boy 
wipes with one finger. His sister 
has a fever and will not rise today.

He notices other clear 
green streaks and thinks that maybe 
these are his sister's, and runs 
to the faucet. His brow has become wet 
and he washes that too.

Only the screen doors are closed. 
He looks in. His mother 
is strangely blurred by the screen 
but the cloth she carries 
is luminous and drops large 
slow drops. For two days

the boy spends his time like this, 
like the clouds that are just 
out there. He will not enter the room 
where snakes startle his sister 
and there are so many days and nights 
in a short time. His sister 
looks new when she wakes.
Lawrence, you astound me, 
like the lawn busy with uniforms, 
white against green, like a spring snow.

I saw you hug the great thigh 
of a nurse who went on talking above you. 
At night, you are above her, 
a little moon-face 
that has slipped through the window. Perhaps

then you are shared by the other children, 
who are this sound of loons 
and peepers 
from the flooded meadow.

Is it morning?
No, it's the birth 
of stone and iron. You begin twelve years 
into your life, a smooth face 
like a rose that leans, sobbing 
on the massive shoulder of a wall.

*

We go single-file 
into the woods, a whisper of boots 
and frost behind me. There's a flutter 
when we pass the gravestones, and another 
over a spill of bricks 
from the tower's doorway. Lawrence 
has his hand in my back pocket 
all the way up the spiral stairs. 
We spread into the light 
and are a next in the battlements, 
a circle of eyes. Except 
there is a double face, 
pale and round, bearded and burned. Lawrence

is the only one who's afraid, 
frozen, his mouth 
like one sculpted for water, from which 
birds explode, echoing down stairs 
and tumbling into the valley.

*

Leaves in their fires colors 
are suspended along the path.

One is a gift for a girl 
whose hand goes to meet it, 
and there's a cut 
somewhere inside 
as she balls it up 
in her fist, then kneels 
to place her palm 
to its palm.

The boy with black hair 
against olive skin is next to her 
collecting blood-leaves, and another 
saves pale alder.

A stranger walks 
through the kneeling children. 
He is like that rock 
loaded with quartz, another light 
in the blue-green thicket.

*

The girls are round 
where they shouldn't be, 
say the nurses: it's an extension 
of the illness.

Those full hips and new breasts 
are now pads on the floors 
of the rooms with drains.

They are still surprised.

What the boys take 
through the tiny windows 
is what they should have.

It is why a dozen 
nurses and doors 
sound alike when they meet

this morning. 
The shining body 
of a girl winds down

Through the meadow, a stream 
of dark boys behind her, and then 
the nurses, large and slow

like snowflakes 
that fall into water, 
or the shirts falling
about the girl.

*

A woman was replaced by her brother. 
She gutted the rooms 
they entered together. There's metal

in her throat and skull, like a gong 
that sounds in the room 
where she calls the brother.

The children are silenced. Downstairs, her head 
is cocked like a bird at attention, and his name 
is out there in silence, beyond

the children's silence. It makes a tour 
of drawing rooms, finds nothing, 
and returns during the rustle 
of lunch, when they are just lifting 
spoons and forks, and putting them down again.

*

She's in her dress of red flowers; 
he in loose gray trousers and a white shirt 
open against a white chest. Their mouths move 
as slowly as her fan. Under the bench 
are a newspaper and a sandwich that fell 
through the slats in a morning shower.

The water-colorist is looking
above them at the green dome 
of the shade tree, dipping her brush 
into a little well between thin lips. 
Her Cupid's-bow is green and cracked 
and all about her are small crushed cups.

At the feet of a man whose head 
shakes No, there's a boy who wants to tell 
something he has memorized, and promises 
to tell only half. He's talking and singing 
under a fist, yanking at a cuff. 
The man topples in silence and even 
the boy's running cannot be heard.

*

Once there was a river entrance 
for supplies, and a manacled wonder 
standing at the bow. 
He could only see 
what was ahead of him, where water 
met the lawn, water lapping 
and the grass lapping back, like hair 
in a bath. The he would rise with the lawn 
to the shoulders of the house.

It fell down around him 
and came up again in stone. 
The house is a room 
he's walking out of, a stocking foot 
and a skeletal foot, shoes and a sock 
in his hands. His right elbow 
holds his pants to his waist; this woman 
is pulling a belt 
from a large brown envelope. 

He feels he should kiss her 
and feels it is wrong. She makes him 
sit down and finish his shoes. 
He thinks he should have the key 
but they are already in the corridor 
and are jostled by a boy 
counting stairs through twelve. The man 
looks in his hand for a kev 
or an address, 
then drifts across the lawn.

*

Yesterday, a toad was sacrificed in the hall. 
Lawrence believed it would get up again. 
He also believes any number 
is a permutation of his birth-date, 
and that the clock celebrates 
only twice a day. He is here now 
in the gown he hates, having pulled me 
by the sleeve to wait with him. There are leaves

tapcd in the hall, a light by the clock 
and one at each iron door. The year 
is approaching snow, the arrival 
of Lawrence's parents. He's my child now 
and is allowed an opcn door 
through which he passes, 
then climbs into a night 
from which someone else 
will take him.
The doctor has inoculated you 
with a mild version of the disease. 
He turns away like the assassin 
in your dreams, and the smell of the classroom 
comes back: chewing gum and the pure sweat 
of children instead of cordite. It's simple 
and stupid how it hinges on one word: shot. You reel back

but the movement is small 
and fluttery, like the butterfly 
in front of a cloud in the stereoscope. 
You take its colors for reality. For a whole day 
trees and stones stand out, nothing has been built

flush and exact, your toes 
are small melons on dirt 
which is like the granules of snow 
in a creche; large fingers 
advance on your lips.

Just when you come back to yourself, 
when you feel wood at your elbow 
and a hate for ceramic dogs, you see your mother 
fall to her knees and hear a new voice. You smile 
before you cry with her, as if you'd brushed 
a dusty velvet curtain.
The boy kicks gravel in his drive 
and up pops a scallop shell. Grave

shadows of cumulus turn it gray, 
but in the sun, country-western,

gospel, and violin love music 
mix like rusty wire and vanish

like a fuse of laden air.
You can almost see a fish drying,

a woman's leg drying, the smoke 
from a stack and from a barbeque.

Saturday morning's first beers 
sweat in all those right hands

while the left ones power-steer. 
You do see the woman's bare leg

and foot stuck out the window, 
so still, and the dune grass

bending over, turning silver, 
like some new revolving world.
The field gathers 
and goes in here. 
Slipping latitudes 
cast doubt on the nearest tree, 
in leaf now or always.

Grass is burned to the river, 
but I follow smoke from another fire. 
It floats over fences that enclose 
the house, a clay pot, the seed.

There are no corners. 
The dimness called "home" 
refuses to turn, goes on out of season,

sticks with the next indefinite step.

*

It was called "Blue River."

A crow 
captures the field, 
noises are disowned, color 
bled out.

My climb 
out of frost into a tree 
brings no reason for looking out. 
Thinking is in that time 
of apples, arboreal happiness.

It was called "Blue River."
And at Blue River 
the water was slow, muddy 
in the same way that night comes.
Frost came but twice
and even the rains were scarce.
A patch of goldenrod 
grew in the watery shadows 
beneath his window. Letters, 
reams of letters were carried 
down the walk from the portico,
his tunnel through the ochre winter.

He scraped at his beard
and was shamed by the dry skin 
that adhered to ink, that fell on the word "sorry."

To whom was he writing? 
Someone distant, all distant, 
his letters borne over the horizon. 
Orion was closer. The garden 
was as distant, the time from seed to harvest 
the same as letter and answer.

"Sorry for the long delay. I 
was busy. I was otherwise occupied. 
The linden felt something today 
and dropped some of its leaves."

The "I" and "thou." 
Last night he dreamt the "I" 
gone to the station to wish "thou" goodbye. 
The station was bunker, a squared hole 
from which the train would emerge. 
He broke down and climbed 
into someone's lap.

The temptation 
was to give dream its lead, 
let it decorate, lose "you" in "they." 
He even waved. The window fogged 
and the garden called him --
its watering, its shade 
a whisper of mountain life.

It seemed flat, pressed 
between thick sheets of cellophane, 
only the grass at his feet 
rising to inhabit the world.

*

Full, though not at flood, 
the river lifted him, 
brought him closer to the canopy 
next to fulfilled banks. The dense hardwood 
was not his symmetry and always seemed low, 
as if to push one into a picnic.

Sprawled, he'd shared a passive feast, 
lost nothing on the cleared ground 
beneath a day-long shade, he and Pasqual 
brimming with aspen, snowfield, and ptarmigan 
while the two women rowed, trolling 
at the edge of the sun-struck channel.

He tossed a rock into the livid green 
and relished the sparks disturbed from its slowness. 
A gust of wind turned the leaves, bleached the sky. 
The ground rushed into the sudden calm, sealed them 
in a vacuum with deadwood, leaves, the women's
scented clothes. But Pasqual and the women 
spoke to him from outside.

He couldn't answer. His mouth was full of bark 
from the stick that held his jaws apart.

*

A girl in crinoline 
watched over him and he worked backward 
to delve into the bundle 
in her lap. Both of them 
were photographed before a carpet 
hung on the line; her hair, parted in the middle, 
made the same dark pyramid as her skirts. 
And beneath those skirts 
her legs broke out in a shallow sweat, 
teased by the knife-edged crinoline. In her care
the baby went bump. Sunlight crept across the yard,
releasing the dank smell of carpet.

*

The unseen orchestra played all night, 
but as the sky is stripped at daybreak, 
so the fundamentals 
fell from his hearing. He heard 
the secondary orchestra, the crystal gears, 
wolf-tone engaged with harmonic. His arms, 
the seen body, reached and grasped 
while he slept, not wanting to wake 
to that vast recessional. 
So the night opened and curled, 
revealing its silver spine. 
he entered and dove 
but did not feel, instead
was stained by darkness. Rising, 
he struck a crystal pipe 
that rang dully, then stumbled 
and the whole night rang.

*

Dear Claire, a late summer & I must get out. 
Anything but yellow air! A kettle 
boiling in the kitchen, that's what I find 
almost everywhere. Last night, when I got off the train,
the grass by the tracks was burning. The smoke 
hung low around the station, but sort of boiled 
at the tunnel. Little red lights 
flickered here & there. Everyone 
was busy & getting  further away, 
as if chasing something into a tunnel. 
And then, Claire, there were two shots --
a nickel-plated revolver. I'd swear that gun 
rose out of the tracks, or from the shiny wheels 
that were now shrieking -- a glint taking shape. 
But there was no one. Down by the tunnel 
water hissed & steam rose quickly. 
What was it, Claire? I walked home 
annoyed by the crickets who knew nothing. 
I know what you're thinking, but now I'll hallucinate 
those fields before you & your Canadian air. The day 
is gaining weight & I must leave you 
for my blessed, though shallow, nap.

*

A Goodyear blimp sputtered across the sky. 
There was a lie about the flash in Nevada. 
Overhead, a year to the day 
from one of those events, B-29's
flew in a V-formation. The pavement was hot 
and the parade uncomfortable 
even in khaki shorts. He burned his fingers 
on the general's green convertible.

He wished for water 
in that miasma of tar and oil. 
He wished for the coolness of the slim blond in white. 
On the long walk home, 
he lay on the first lawn, used it up, 
then ran into the plumber's supply 
and drank long draughts from the fountain 
in a maze of enameled steel, all white, 
all with chromium stubs that drew gallons, columns 
of transparent water, and he was filled with ice 
whose needles begged exit from his flesh.

                          He poled north,
stashed the pole and paddled through the narrows.
In this I see my life. Lunch in an eddy
nosed in, bow and stern in crevices.
                            And in the eddies --
they splashed, imitating motion -- I see the possibilities
seized honestly by the senses -- the boat
knocked against the rocks -- the body,
used in that realm, then put back
as what I see now.
       He rocked free, lost ground,
but paddles into a view of aspen. Equivalents
for what was forgotten, and what was forgotten -- stunted spruce
now on a hillock with its skirt of shale -- as sweet
as the possibilities
           that wave as I wave at them.
He slept in the boat he would leave,
                       They are there too
dreamt the smooth round faces
                  in elegant confusion with the seized
drifting over inches of clear water.
Both terror and aesthetics no doubt fuel memory
to spear night and time to that
morning thirty (standard) years before,
but in what form, combination, interplay?

-Marq Dyeth, in Stars In My Pocket Like Grains of Sand, Samuel R. Delany
The home of Judge Roy Bean, 
the crypts at Queretaro, 
the Concord meeting house,

they all breathe the same air, 
that of a barely remembered rain 
or the invisible cloud 
after a scattered pile of leaves.

It is air 
not used to exhalations, 
but one that breathes into us 
and breathes into us 
a long slow intake of breath. Now

does not exist, nor then, 
and we continue breathing in. Take 
it says, and we do, until we topple 
into the headlong future

that never was 
but is with the next breath.
There are the names 
painted on sloping strata, 
white tears sliding toward rainwater.

The beads have collected 
where sky is the final pit. 
There are the holes drilled for dynamite, 
abandoned premonitions.

Now you see forest on the edge, 
threatening to spill over, isometrics 
that raise your head. Up there is a 
rusted crane, and below, 
a steel worm.

Gaze into the pond. It is full 
of false endings, full of those names. 
One is trying to meet its wavering mate, 
a backwards cousin. 
You are the third party.

You can't make them meet. 
The parts like their distance 
and there is already completion. 
They make sense when you go away.
Like the hand of her husband pressing, 
it goes beneath the earth, turns to straw 
the deep white roots. Over the creekbed

come those who watch from the yellowing trees, 
watch as she and the girl break down a length of berm 
and bury the man. She is watched, this girl 
who is the last to shrink within her shadow.

Now someone comes to the maples, 
the ferns in their shade, and the evenly spaced 
piles of rock -- a background like raw canvas.

He fumbles in haste to take the photograph, 
that frame in which rock and leaf-shadow 
go tunneling into the lamp, unremarkable, and he sees 
what he did not see: the broad, flat face of a woman; a girl

who'd lived long in her best dress -- here like a dull goblet 
with its residue of wine. Both of them dull and still, 
aware of him in their hated sun.

*

Though the lenses spilled in haste, 
cast their quick parallax and half-rang 
before hiding in the moss,

he finds them as if displayed, not his own, 
and squats to stare 
at their versions of sky: the only sky 
in the afternoon of woods, the last thing he can see

a muddy finch darting from a branch. The clear way
is the path, where nothing brushes him, where the tilt is forward
and water left or right.  The flat is sudden, almost up,
and light leaks into the darkness.
                         A tiny red sun
wobbles on the asphalt.
Where the dead grass on a hill 
resembles sand or a nude, 
where a strip of sunlight 
comes through stormclouds, no one 
leaves the house on its bright edge 
or the house across the way in evening: 
here is the place to walk with a friend, 
to feel both the sun and the cool damp air.

"The devil is getting married." 
"Ha, well then, it's a short ceremony. 
It's raining."

Odd that it should touch him first, 
then me, that split second magnified. 
We live at neither house, but are trespassing 
equidistant from both, so that perhaps 
both owners are on the phone to each other.

Something about their being on the phone 
brings on the feeling of night. Distance grows, 
the night rolls within itself. Shadows, like dark bars, 
cross their yellow windows. We are lost to them, but     	
       tonight they will lock 
every door and window, 
call ahead and say, "They were headed your way."

In fact, we have turned around. We are leaving 
this sensuous rump of a hill, clearing it
of ourselves so that it will wake as a mere roll
in the aspect of houses, something for the wind
to try its hand at.  Under the clear sky
someone will wake, see the grass lean, and lean after us.
Two bodies lie by a pond that has two shores: one that seems 
casual, with roots, twigs, and leaves that slip under the surface; 
the other formal, its fine gravel raked in sinuous lines, the 
terminus of a narrow road. The bodies are of two kinds -- wood 
and flesh -- and they lie on the casual shore staring at the forest       
umbrella. A carriage comes by the road, stops, and two men step                 
down. They crush around the pond and arrive at the bodies. The 
first man pulls a handmirror from his vest and holds it before the 
fleshy nostrils. The second man simply lifts the dummy by its 
hinged arms and legs, but stops momentarily while the first man 
breezily passes the mirror before the wooden nostrils. The 
dummy is propped in the corner of a seat, then both men slowly 
and clumsily haul the heavier body, laying it on the floor 
between the seats. The ride is bumpy. The ventriloquist does not
move, but the dummy time and again drops its jaw, rolls its eyes, 
and bangs the seat with its heels.
The bulb swings and his melon shadow weighs on the first old 
man he's thrown to the floor. In the silence, while spectators 
stare through dust pounded from the planks, I hear what sounds 
like seeds sifting and settling in the defeated husk.

One then another contestant takes him on, but it's the same as 
before: the shriveled bodies hurling themselves at each other, no 
striking with arms or legs, just the thud of trunk against leathery 
trunk. With his third victory, he makes the slightest 
acknowledgment of my presence, a mere turn that causes all the 
spectators to cheer me and begin slapping my back.

I am surprised and embarrassed by this pride that makes me look 
for him. My comforts call now like waves of heat, drawing me 
from the sulphurous room. He is gone, but again there is that 
sound as of a gourd lightly handled.
Here is the road that has always run on only one side of the 
woods. On the right, the east, are the woods, and on the left is 
the caretaker's house. The caretaker is asleep in his boat on the 
pond just inside the woods. He is visible from just about any 
spot on the road.

From the boat, looking west, the fields are endless. There is a 
slight rise toward infinity, but since the whole horizon does this, 
the imagined dip to the pond becomes physical.

A dotted line across the average middle of the pond would reveal 
a slice of darkness to the east.  It is toward that darkness that a 
man walks purposefully, having stopped at the caretaker's house 
for directions, and who now unbelievably misses the caretaker on 
the pond.

He stops at a hut, enters, and sees a crude shelf on which there 
is a doll with half-closed eyes and crazed porcelain flesh, though 
its body feels like a stuffed bird. He dusts it off and takes it with 
him, continuing his walk until he comes to a road that has 
always run on only one side of the woods.
When the wind finally stopped 
I saw how high the grass had grown.

That didn't matter -- it was the piano 
that was different, better, and fit in 
now between plain and sky.

Its colorless notes 
loved that corridor. They stole 
blue, green, or sometimes ochre 
from distant southern hills.

When company came, 
we lay in the grass 
away from the house, the barn, and the sheds. 
where there was plenty of piano room,

and every note 
in the middle octaves sounded.

Nights fell with a dampened piano, 
dawns broke with endless runs.

There was no end to the octaves, 
no end up or down, and side by side 
infinite pianos dimpled the sky.
He had us follow him and we hid behind the hedge. He 
whispered: "I want you to consider what's in front of your
nose."

There were bees, vertical files of ants, and the odor of decay. 
Through the hedge, we saw a shimmering field, tiny cars that 
whooshed beyond it, palm trees behind the cars, and a white 
horizon past them.

There was a man in the field and his legs and khaki pants 
undulated with the shimmering field. The far palms rattled, the 
field got hotter and seemed to lap against the cars, like an ocean 
against a causeway.

The man walked like a hunter and the hedge followed him, 
dragging its roots, magnifying the odor of decay. The bees fled, 
the ants rummaged in the sweet uprooted place.

Meanwhile, the man raised a rifle and lowered his head to the 
sights. He moved as if along a slot, sliding behind and in front of 
shrubs, then shot and hit a bell, the bullet striking like a 
hammer.

The bell rang on into the night, when the field was brilliant with 
lights and crowds shuffled about. Then he appeared, offering us a 
plaster duck that he carried in white gloves. Its chalky bill flaked 
orange, grew soft, and fell off. The body followed: a soft but 
resistant oval, a mass of feathers, then many small feathers caught
by the wind and scattered among the fields.
It's December and I sit in the office 
trying unsuccessfully to begin the series 
based on topology and attempts to prove 
the Poincare conjecture. I realize 
in staring at the calendar 
that it's been five years 
since I last spoke with you in person. 
The same goes for James A., who writes long, 
single-spaced, unparagraphed letters 
about $99 airfares from NYC to Belgium, 
or Jody, who writes from St. Ives, 
tells me who's been there, and includes 
the fishing report, and Greg's Christmas letter 
is about a translation project in Portland, 
and comes with Volume 4, Number 1, 
of a magazine I've never seen, but which he 
says 
we spawned somehow. I can't figure out 
what he's talking about. It simply looks 
familiar, like another strand of memory, 
as if he's presented one space more 
than the three I can visualize. Or, I've imagined 
one of you sitting here in the cane chair, 
lifting a cup from the polished burl, and you 
have imagined me sitting in whatever chair, 
lifting from a table what I must.
No matter what the ruler 
laid on the map says, 
they are all equally distant. It is the same
from the desert to the granite 
underpinnings of Brooklyn, from this 
volcanic rim to the other, from the fishing grounds 
off St. Ives back to the desert.

One smells the natural abundance 
of azaleas and rhododendrons, 
another the predominant tang of evergreens, 
another orange blossoms and jacaranda, foxglove 
and hawthorn for another, and for one 
a bitter geranium that bends to no wind 
this side of a sooty window.

They wake to the ocean 
shoving rocks around, the conversation 
between wind and mild rain, 
the quiet of a desert whose sounds 
are small and hidden, and the street's 
amplification of motors.

Nonetheless, one day the light 
is nearly the same everywhere. 
The effect is to make the distance 
from windows to the ordinary sights 
exactly what it should be, equal 
to the stone wall from here, or to the naked 
winter elm with its loaded branch.
Camellias bloom 
around the little cul-de-sac,
as if the neighbors had agreed 
some years ago. I see no others

until the short-cut, 
where they bloom in deeper, 
darker yards, and the air 
along the street is cool.

I could drive on 
but turn where I work, where camellias 
once again appear, though whiter 
and ganged up like clouds. They sway

and send perfume somewhere. 
The breeze that moves them 
might reach you tomorrow. It may 
ripple up the slopes

through aspen groves, appear to 
rest, then return as the room 
that seems suddenly cleared.
We live
with one page of the calendar
and an hour
is a coupling of voices,
much like the random lighting
of lamps below a plane:

seeing them 
links them, and the darkness 
with them as well.

How does one arrive 
here so happy? If you take 
the little round lights 
and turn them, they are the same.

They have no flat places 
so you might set them down. 
This is why 
people look at us, you there, me here.

We carry the same thing 
and it is all we can do to 
explain.
The whole thing is somewhat easier now, 
addressing you, and not talking to the idea.

This morning the day arrived 
like a pale yellow plate 
over the industrial end of town, 
and the cold smell of leaves 
slipped over the transom.

It was all that was required 
to cause a break, to have me observe 
that the digital clock and courthouse chimes 
didn't match, and that it was time to begin.

The "Perspectives" section 
of the paper almost cancelled 
the Poincare conjecture --
something about "Radiation 
Equivalent Man."

It was another idea, like a shelf of smoke 
above a little town, tucked in and battling winter.
It is like leaving toys 
in the little yellow house, 
built for a mother-in-law 
and now rented in six-month spells.

It is barely visible from uphill, 
like a dime-store amethyst 
suspended in a green nap, 
nestled in the grid 
of gray and buff streets, 
with the model railroad 
going, cutting almost center 
in the town growing up.

It is of growing up 
that we speak, gaining conviction 
from the aerial view. This spring 
is the one of blackened tulips, 
limbs cracking under snow. 
Will you take 
another six-month lease, 
or sit longer on this hill?

This summer 
is the one of fires held back, 
the one of spontaneous roses.
I've cut the string. The kite levitates. It hangs right in there at 2
o'clock, its red vibrant against the blue sky.

The birch bends beneath it. We are all in the wind and my link
with the kite is strong. I can't bear to look down. My body feels
the gusts and I become very aware of my ribs. The kite is
motionless but I sense its minute pulse, its love with the wind.

Sal, my neighbor, comes out in the late afternoon and feels the
air around me. No strings, Sal. No fishline, no radio-control.
The damned kite just hangs there.

Almost evening, the sky a cobalt blue and the red kite with a
halo. Sal has binoculars and is examining the kite for ailerons.

Let Sal demonstrate wonder: I am as buoyant as the kite. There's 
the bodiless voice of my neighbor, and myself, an ethereal
witness, totally satisfied, thankful I have no hands to caress the
kite.

Sal says I have a martini in my hand. Thanks, Sal. I lift it
without looking at it, feel a tingle at my lips, then with one
hearty gulp toast the kite. The feeling is impossible, like an ice
cube floating in air.

It is evening and only I can see the kite, that diamond shape
where there are no stars. In the morning there are no stars, and
no kite. But there is space for another.
The windows in space/time:
where an "event" is the window from the accessible past
into the inaccessible future, and to the side --
the walls, if you will, of this largest of rooms --
are the inaccessible past and likewise
inaccessible future. The present, then,
is like a blind brother to the event,
and they are separated only by the sheerest membrane.

Norton does it with his heart
he travels ridges and sineclines

well-rounded though not a sphere
rises and Norton

is in his heart.
It came around
when the mouse came around

180° on the flood
bloated and dark waters

seeping into the grave
by the flood ceremoniously

gathered in a countryside
the bowed frail eccentrics

were sketched on the countryside
like the trees themselves

pencil lines against a sail
booted up full and brooding

without ship come to stand
as sail of small horizons

mourners all shades of gray
but for the bobbing mouse

jet black from a pen
in the hand of the dead a gush

on Lu Chou's ebony table.

Lu Chou, asleep,
hurries in an elevator

to meet the dream woman
who becomes flesh and is destroyed

by the Ch-in sun.
The jade knife, leaving its place
in the spectrum, relays

to Lu Chou's parting eyes a blue line
that pierces the window: Lu Chou

cast into the black world
whose shell is light.

A cicada impaled on a sparrow's beak
does its thousand rattles
to rival the calls of the fledglings who eat it.

The old man
thinks the cicada is inside
and the bird outside, both alive,
though the cicada is not where it should be.

This effects his day.

All day he turns his ear
to the beginning of any sound: the trowel
in his wife's hand at the garden,
the turning of the cock for water.

Can the sun
make such a sound,
warming the dry leaf into a dish?

It is the quiet
that concerns him now,
the quiet broken by his daughter,

who is even now
close enough to be heard
but must come nearer; who, with the mother,
stands just the other side
of his ear and stares

into the smoking hole
of the evening's first meteor.

*

He yearns for the night porch
and its droning silence,
where the large family
is safely contained and seems
an afterthought in the thin house.

He remembers blue stick-figures
completed by the movement
of males in heavy snow,
the night pushed out, the chrysalis
worked to brittleness, a body
breaking into night
even as the jerky figures
pulled snow over the world of Lu Chou.

The woman who is not here
inhales the scent of blossoms
that explode with the train's speed.
       From the space
between two coaches, she sees again
a configuration of lake, volcano,
and heavily flowered shore.
It is the image of each day
       and once again
she expects the interminable green,
the lianas and their variegated darkness. This time
       the flowers lash
at the tight little city, a knot
that contracts, then unravels, 
revealing at its center a sad horse
that turns in fences of tin:
       one last night,
she thinks, and the train climbs,
slowing on the flank of a cone
that is the twin of another,
       and on the lake
she imagines a plume of smoke
from the locomotive. Fire joins fire
in the water, like the red pistil
of an enormous flower
       that dips into itself.

In Lu Chou's childhood, the executioner
would play with two small helmets,
tiny bowls, really, sewn from the hind
found on the mountain. In them,
the sky had been reduced 
to twelve large stars.
The pomegranite
had more; none in the orange
whose empty rind lay beside him.

But when, in his forgetfulness,
he turned inside-out one spangled shell,
the seeds of light were as his charges,

halved, halved again,

faster than the axe, invisible
in the double hood of night. 
I could begin with the owl or the cage,
the courtyard or summer,
though summer encompassed them all,
pumping its long days and short nights
into the blood, until one begged
for a longer night. Like summer,
the tall grasses and weedy elms
swallowed almost all the courtyard contained,
shone through the overgrowth, and whose black
In that one cage, the Great Gray lived
its unnatural life, turning and peering
in its extended night, waiting for the clicks of the wheel
and the great chimney of the courtyard --
to lift, if it can, past the second floor,
the third floor, and the vents and ducts
of the science building, to discover
night's walls rushing past the stars.
Neptune in the third house

I don't know what this has to do 
with another unfinished thing, 
but I saw in a dream the last 
of a series of homes. It came 
stripped of 200 years of history, 
a red dusty road going to the end 
of its course as it does in real life; 
its banks, because it seemed a dry bed, 
were contoured as they are now -- peopled, 
built upon, littered with the future. 
I traveled with a shadow-person, as is 
often the case in dreams, playing cars 
with real cars which shouldn't have been there, 
but which he, fleshed now as a stranger, 
wanted to move from atop a bank 
into the dusty road with the strength 
and expediency of dreams.

In the switching yard of dreams, 
I accepted this research as a magnesium flare 
shadow-person did not see. I had 
the road to myself now, followed it, 
ate up history, and came to the houses 
that were as they are now: endangered, 
but also blessed, by a window. In time, 
among the jokes, the deaths, and affairs 
of those who live there, I will say, 
because I am caught with them, 
I had a dream about this place.

A village bell-tower was sleepy.

It wrapped itself in a little band of trees, counted to
three and fell asleep.

When it woke up, there were no more than a few trees,
with silver dew under their armpits.

A large burnt paper cross was branding its forehead.
The nobleman steps down from his carriage.

It's a district in the mountain valley.

The white shapes of old hands knit caps for thousands
of spice-boxes.

At the manor, the animals are dressed up.

The fox is in a tuxedo, a russet flame between his
tails.

The nobleman lights candlesticks and eats rabbit stew.
The dormouse was an ice-floe of the mammoth era.

The wind turned leaves in the washed linen.

They heard the sun approach and withdraw, with a solemn
step, like organ music.

At lunch, the decanter's cork shone under the acetylene
burner, naive as a pear.

After searching a long time, the children found a
hunter, lost, upside-down among branches.

Very far off, in the bends of old roads, some robbers
with a sack and a club cried: "Your money or your
life!"
He gently does his angelic work.

The school has four walls and its windows play
dominoes.

Daytime opens its laughing drawers: yellow battles,
slow cards, wise measures, sleeping gloves.

Then, evening glides on the blue and white icing, his
slate scribbled with animals and heads.

Bob's toy-box contains a target, nails from wooden
shoes, gelatin balls, a picture with a hunter in a
derby hat.

At night, Bob sleeps in a little puff-pastry boat.
After exhausting itself with white dust on the roads
and bilberries in the wood, great summer, disarrayed
and weak, is pulled in through the roof, through its
wicker hall shaped like a hoop-net. Now, it's
neglected: ant-eggs clog its nose and a sore beard
pushes them up to the slots of its eyes, a beard of
rotting branches that's called autumn.
The blue glasses, found in an elevated railroad car,
belong to the victim, Lady Morton.

But Nat and the coroner, misled to the black windows in
depots, re-enact the daily routines of her double.

The job hinges on a leaking cask, painted red, with
mysterious contents.

There's also a garret, a furnished hotel overrun with
nettles, padded doors, a secret platform.

All the action happens on Tuesday, poor day, stamping
on the rain's filings.

Guided by a jockey, Nat discovers the culprit in a
phoney pastor's osier suitcase.

He's a horrid dwarf, of Mongolian ancestry. The pastor
is his lieutenant.
The soup with jonquils that's eaten at the fairies'
house, a dull little spoon gave me the recipe.

One evening it lured me under its raincoat. In the
dark, against its heart, a little light was living. A
weak little reddish flame, surrounded by a blue halo.

It's her -- I've understood it ever since -- she's who
hummed me the recipe.

Alas! My gasp was so strong that she died from it.
She's morning's residence. She's as clear as she is
invisible, as tranquil as forgotten lands.

Her hair is golden, her smooth windows exchange
glances.

She appears in bold alluring colors, a pretty basket of
dew, protected by a long crystal rifle.

On the doorstep, a bush shakes off his medals.

The door is open, but the bush hesitates forever: he
doesn't see he's invited.

Gently, the house empties, she jingles her dress, her
heart rustles: the dazed bush doesn't understand.
It's a very complicated game.

From time to time, the glass rifle speaks all alone and
shatters some small thing.
What was it a question of? A hair's breath, in all.

A tree was catching fire, a pond was sulking, a dew
sprinkled maid-servant was lulled to sleep by currant
bushes.

What was it a question of? A tiny line. Compact little
figure, naked Merisette.
When the dawn's heart begins to beat, the high little
clouds come down to breakfast in the trees.

                                *

Behind the masked clouds playing the big drum, real
clouds, still and caught in dreams, are hushed up.
They are the sky's memory.

                                *

Tired from wandering alone in the roadless sky, a dark
cloud has gone to die in the forest.
Thursday is always pleasant with frost and a naked girl
on the country's palm.

The merchant of clouds counts the precious stones of
the amazing house: an inviting lamp.

The girl in the forest, brief snow-maid dressed in
fire, in a leaving-coat.

The white trees are listless.

The house is a log, the merchant, Stout John, like the
wind.
An uncle smokes a pipe, blows smoke, knows his target.

An abbot traces a lion, builds a cardboard cone.

The oldest child studies his shoulder joint.

A mother puts on her huge thimble, picks up a needle,
yawns.

A neighbor brings in a display of horns that just lies
about, tells of his journey from Austria, drinks.

A table gloats in quarters.

A child lies in ambush in a house.

A house has a thousand windows.

Heavy weather throbs in a countryman's cloak.
We were hoping to spend Saturday in the parlor in
Arabian sacks.

It used to have a ladder under its arm and a trowel as
shoulder-belt.

The clock rang carefully, with an odor of preserved
pears.

A piece of thread was loafing on an armchair: it was
the week's pay.
I kill the third bird while watching myself in the
glass.

The first I had taken for a chair, one of those folding
chairs which sometimes flutter between the hooks of the
mirrors.

I heard the second's peck through the keyhole.

I found it squashed against the back of the glass, the
mender of faces. It was clear as oblivion.

The third was the breast of the mirror itself.

It was flapping a thousand blinding hands, a thousand
hands of fire.

I was forced to close my eyes. It died because of them.
Saturday always means a pail of open oysters and a
gaping plank, over there, in the corner of the wood
where Oger, the staircase-maker, lives.

His wife Octavia washes with the black soap and eats
the raw, chilled comb of a cock killed during the night
by an axe-stroke, on the bakery block.

His drunken son Oscar has a sore throat. He set up a
cutting table in the cabbage patch. He licks the
almanac. It smells bad.

The carpenter has bare fore-arms. He whistles between
his teeth.

He thinks about his brother the peddlar's tired horse.
He dreams of his daughter Odile, dead at fifteen, from
hemorrhaging.

Heaven is pale, its cheek swollen, with waterpockets
under its eyes and a bandage on its calf.

In the evening, a preserved egg is eaten.
A cuckoo, larger than the forest, digs a hole in the
still warm, ashen landscape.

The butt of a rifle spreads over the arrogant
mountains.

A wisp of straw is placed as observer at the side of
the hole.

A guinea-hen's eye, detached from its body, serves as a
signal.

The eye reddens: the butt coagulates, the cuckoo's
feathers gather in a very furious four-fourths
movement.

The straw glitters a long time in the complicated
fistula of the sky's deserter.

Thus, in the morning twilight, the winter cuckoo is
sucked in by his surroundings.
He followed, point by point, the instructions on the
hand-bill.

Carefully, prudently, he folded the paper in quarters,
then in tens, then again in a thousand equal little
triangles.

His work finished, he hid, for the night, under his
pillow.

Even so, in the morning a woman he didn't know was
washing, shamelessly, in front of his mirror.

In the mist, a quiet finger had drawn the curly head of
a ram.

The paper, folded so many times, had disappeared.
In times of swollen cheeks, when the clay bugles roar,
the little railroads of gold coins run, in festoons,
around the country.

Oh beards of fire, oh streams rousing the thirst!

But, at the heart of the region, among the mold growing
under arms, milk-filled celebrities of the white wood
nourish the lumpy pillow of sleep which dents the young
cows.
The felled tree still has a tree house.

It also is left supporting this or that branch, with
its birds.

But the birds die off and the trestle reaches the top,
the home will still be a sign of what has no form, the
tree being, besides, overthrown.
He takes a rather spacious meadow, with a sky to match.

He sits in the south or at the back, according to
whether his partner is tall or missing.

If he falls, it's water-eating.

If he leaps, it's dancing.

He wins when his partner goes off and doesn't return.

He loses when his partner sits down to the table while
taking his shoes off.

It's a draw when the players resemble the game.

It's also played in the thicket (with planks) or in the
mountains (with nets).
Two ladies climb the lower street.

One is dressed in black, the other in black, the third,
undressed.

These ladies are charged with mounting the lower
street. The street is so low that it takes, thus, four
ladies to climb it.

After climbing the low street, the five ladies go down
it again.

To ruin the lower street seems to be the purpose of
these half-dozen stylish ladies.
I would feast on scoundrels and fall into step.

When the cage was parting from the bird, I was arriving
at my encounter.

When the kennel was eating the dog, I confused bodies
and belongings.

But, in broad daylight, I recovered my distance and
usually got ahead of myself.
We'd grown wiser. We might have become nosegays, on the
day's silver lattices.

When someone rapped on our door, we heard the noise in
our hearts.

We ran to open. There was never anyone.

It was always morning, mild, settled, clear, which
threw us the pearls in its eyes.     

Because our visitors no longer had business at the
doors.

They sprung from our looks, from our furniture, in
their Sunday best, marvelous.

They always wore flowers in their buttonholes.

They were sparkling or invisible, actors of light or
musicians of shadows, to our liking.
Look out! This is not a bouquet: it's a huge concerto
for all the cocks.

Aroused from a daze, on the untouchable stone of dawn,
at noon it sets fire to the structure's main beam.

Then it climbs, unquenchable, spreads, flings itself
into the azure depths, down to the frenzy of the
bottom, down to the wheel's center where red is the
heart of blue.
Step-ladder, tiny pyramid for miserly hunchbacks, near-
sighted reckoner, the reseda, gathered in its cunning
little cabin, breaks up, clears itself of perfume.

This flower is the friend of silent eyes, of century-
old hands, of honest blades.

She grows near modest shale-like clusters -- these,
devout, dyed purple, or else those, burnt to brown
ribbons, daughters seen from a libertarian star.

When the limed soil turns toward the sexton, the weekly
herb heralds, at the bottom of some old fashioned desk,
some thin copy-book bound in boards of somber blue and
covered with beautifully written secrets.

When she's moved by a ridge of fired peat, the flower
forecasts for the initiated only such a display of
nymphomania, such nutritious folly, nauseating tropical
inheritance.

And when she becomes incrusted in the millennial
foundations of bits of shale, she's the prophetess of
the glass reed, the measly pot, the head schoolmaster,
the starched virgin, the pigeon-breeding spiritualist.

Her perfume is a secondary condition since its
disproportion to her stem and its continual layers make
it unexplainable.
A trapped fawn: I fix her up, I dress her, I help her
recover, I imprison her in a tower. I suckle her with
the moon, bits of riddles, wasted blows.

When it's windy, we travel on our mares of lace.

When it rains, we climb, in slow spirals, to tease the
nightingales with a stick.

When the doors, like women in fallen gowns, exchange
their passwords, we unfold in green, in grey, in jerks,
piece by piece, like the perforated music roll of a
player piano.

I call her Mamzelle Impossible. I stuff her with food.
I send her out to beg.
Standing up, weightless, Ponce has walls.

They're thin. They tremble. It's a forest.

These are princes washing themselves, unsettled
quarrels, or a lot of Chinese peddlers.

He makes his move. He spreads out. He's in Naples, in
cherries, in Dumas.

He forms his woman and he forms all: all forms.
I've only known one emperor in my life. He called
himself Zenon and did odd jobs at my parents' house.
He worked only at night.

During the day, he hid. Sometimes we caught a glimpse
of him, under a disguise. I'll always remember the
orphic throne's silence and all I didn't see, behind
the delightful picture of kittens hanging on the wall.

He left us one October morning, a long time ago. We
found the remains of his crown in the pear tree. When
he left, he blocked up the low door of the garden.

I know nothing more to tell about this emperor. And if
I've written that his name was Zenon, it's out of
friendship for those who speak of gilded armor when
they return from the goat-herds.
It's a February morning. The snow is famous.

He burns some coffee.

The teacher sketches the Ural Mountains.
The mother of the newspaper salesman cries a little,
without turning the light on. And he, in the attic,
pours kerosene on some papers. He's a free-thinker. His
sister is pious. She lost her hair one year from
typhoid fever. She's housekeeper at the Jolimont
asylum.
On summer evenings, the king's daughter is liable to
pass.

The pebbles keep a sharp eye.

The switchman goes home to bed. His beard catches fire.
The puppeteer offers him smelling-salts.

It's clear again, with sulphur of bat, in the lower
room where the inn-keeper's straw mattress mildews.
The soldier is sad down to his last button, on his
special uniform for handling fire-arms.

The soldier, slightly stricken with ataxy, finally
manages to sit down on an isolated hillock. He sighs.
He drops a tear, from the bottom of his heart, into his
gun barrel.
King Louis is deaf as a pot. King Louis is seated on
his rear, before his large window. He watches a
hunchback pass who carries a torn handtowel to the town
hall.
In Laetare, the druggist wakes a dead man with his
trombone.

His wife puts her curlers in a pig's bladder.
When she's tired playing nicely with her adopted
cousins, Nijni's daughter gets up, lights a taper, very
proudly leaves her companions and goes into the next
room, to make ugly faces in front of her mirror.
My God, the garden and its jasmines has been pleated
until it's no larger than a happy little hand, playing
with the floral-patterns of the center bedroom, whereas
a dainty butterfly, with the end of his satin wings,
does his housework all by himself.
In a village worn down to its church steeple, the
mischievous wind rolls its acorns under the door of a
hermitage and tears the winter covering from a
vulnerable easychair, wandering after its face.
The chairs? White, of course. With pretty little
trombones. And cabbage-bows, to honor the party behind
the elephants, important gentlemen, courteous, carried
away with pleasure, and quick enough to leap the
railing, the servants before their most obliging eyes,
maids and their children.
The white house is all black. The black house is all
white. They dwell in the same fable. They naturally
look alike.

Their name is patience. They contemplate their
landscape. They open up in closing.

They are dressed separately. They live in each other.
They keep away from large stars. They never trade
places.
One would be tired, the other was also, but bodily. The
tired man was doing absolutely nothing. The other
seemed to act the same, though involved in various
tasks. The man who did nothing was married. The other
was also, with this slight difference, however, that he
remained strictly celibate. As a husband he lived
alone, in appropriate company. The other lived alone
too, but in a promiscuity of about three thousand make
believe people. They both belonged to the secret
society of similar cases.
The lobster is a bird on stilts, in the species of
nighthawks. He drinks cranially, is well developed, has
been pointed out by LinnÇ under the name of Forge
Roussel. Its body shows 4/5 generally animal. The
hindquarters are composed of a cluster of 17 metal
spools, on divergent axles. The lobster is the only
carnivorous bird that flies backwards.

His characteristic song, which resembles, but is
harsher than, the civet-cat's, is produced by a spur's
vibration in the cranial box, called the sub-machine-
gun. The lobster's calcified eye is used, in
shoemaking, to fasten half-boots.
The valise is a female greyhound of the water-hen
family. Essentially transportable, she's distinguished
from the water-hen community by the fact that she
doesn't live on dry ground.

Her nest, or strap, is made with scraps of untanned
hide that the animal gathers with the help of its
transom, coming out of the very tough beak, usually
devoid of the feathers which end the spine. The
valise's nest is gigantic and has very particular
architecture. It's composed of a cupboard and a closet,
connected by a vestibule or macaroni.

The valise reproduces in the closet. In the cupboard,
after the egg-laying season, she breaks up her
youngsters according to height and looks after them
from the macaroni.

The valise's insatiable appetite makes her a very
dangerous animal. Her capture, however, is easy. Full,
she lets herself be lifted like a feather and can be
carried off without showing the least defensive
instinct. In Holland, the valise's skin is used for
wrapping cheeses. 

The valise hasn't any cry, except for the diplomatic
valise, which is multi-lingual.
He places the maid of his works in the sunlight. She is
born, like several others, in Cortil-Noirmont. This
locality must be considered as existing.

In the sunlight, the maid improves. During the
unfolding of the maid's improvement process, the author
of the works visits the grottoes of Cortil-Noirmont. As
opposed to the locality itself, the grottoes of Cortil-
Noirmont must be considered as non-existing.

Completely improved, the maid becomes a mark of honor
reuniting the author with his works. The meeting
doesn't take place in the grottoes of Cortil-Noirmont.
The meeting takes place under the same improving sun.

Exeunt
The world underbark has long been night.
Roots are a bareknuckled boxer's hands
                  in asphalt; now as in a negative
they are silvering. Knots turn
to diamond chips.
The amputated twig
is a trident of latten
that would spear trampling feet.
Tempests rush through distended limbs,
a tendrilous glowing
diffused on brickscape
where thrown crabapples cling.
And once when lovers passed
this arbor an owl laughed;
small birds sang.
Wind-creased they froze that way.
Our lines were the ribbed underbelly
of a neglected pet.
Against morning indigo, shirts
held their breath from our dream sleep.
Crucified with crude pinnings
they stiffened, rimed
in ragged entrails.
Our pants shriveled and seamed,
paraplegic in their pose.
Stilt-legs incised the air;
stuffed handkerchiefs bloomed
from backpockets like cold, folded roses.
Once more we took them down,
cuffs still-lifed and clamped
in rigor mortis. With cellar warmth
our clothes sagged again, the frumpy remnants
of what we had worn.
They held our sleep longer than we,
and grayer by hours
we tended them back to our mortals' motions.
Wrinkles released, our shirts unaged,
and we thawed, wringing the night from our sleeves.
Sawmill floor unshaven, chips shoelace deep,
hardwood releases
the strength of everything
it holds. Sanding over knags
I feel the wounds soften, Beowulf
binding Grendel's hacked shoulder.
I dissect it, my eyes quadrupled
behind plastic; roughened fingers peel
the phloem away,
the cell-skin letting go, opening
to heartwood
and the bone that cannot bend.
Its rings trace the hardest winter
and most casual summer.
The bark saved for soil,
trim-ends untangle; slabs restrain
the seasons of my life,
now lost in edgings.
Beyond the cemetery
sunset hangs in tiers on tilted windows.
Vents spit dyes on the dirt
that had driven deer in season, drays,
and the sodden hands of desperate farmers.
Hidden beer cans cluster
in unchecked weeds.
                                                       With the sun at angles
the headstones are oblique;
shadows double their image
so the ones buried,
bodiless, are without their callings,
their labors anonymous,
almost unworth
the face of ground.
                                                 After hours
the dry grass disentangles.
Moonlight blanches those Biblical names,
the markers grown hide-thin.
The same wind will dry their dust,
their epitaphs, to dry the hands
of sweatbacked men at their cutters,
their forearms weaker
                                                 than the driest blades.
"Condemned" signs mask posters,
cosmetic webs on ticket-booth windows.
Velvet ropes coil about the arms
of the hardhats,

the gum-pocked chairs brought out
for auctioning.
Hoping
to glimpse the screen in full day
we stand as close as we can,

adjust our vision to the light-dark.
Celluloid strips
come back to dimension;
ticket wheels unravel,
reeling our old silences into the street,

our dim, kept ambitions
clipped from frames.

Stiltingly
this work goes on,
our own faces pale
in the absence of heroes.
A blue light buzzes
with each burnt moth, snapping
the way a bartender unfolds
dollar bills. Cats sulk in
the lame grass, their mouths
whiskered even more. I exhale,
and smoke ties bows around the mirror.
Looking back, I see houses in half-light
like Halloween masks
dwindling into miniatures.
Shins of telephone poles stagger
into distances.
Abandoned cars have crept upon
one another, and rusted into uselessness.
The drone of wasps deafens the woods.
Mosquito-thick headlights
wash the road amber.
My skin is gray.
In my bones something sleeps.
Their backs hammock sunset,
and with imperial glances they look at
the uneaten grass, their nostrils
pinching the white air.

Bales are the piratical chests they covet.
Blinders gone, the trails hoofed down,
they shake their pulled-at manes
like dustmops.

They need no fences, even saddle-stripped.
Their haunches unflex in the weight of just themselves,
the marks from dulled spurs
still stinging a little.

But they know the time shadows lengthen,
and are judicial. They imagine
the stirrups corseting their ribs,
the bits between teeth,
then they let their shadows grow

with their silence.
As they eat,
carrying a belly or a backful,
they nuzzle the grass,
and need no fences.
Unbridled,
they are along the snow line
where silence draws a whitened path,
the reins loosened
from the hands of sleeping men.

The dawn is symmetric in their eyes.
Their manes drip from them,
frozen to their last gallop.
Icebits cling like pollen
from the last storm.

Perhaps the fear of slaughter
has brought them here.
Barbed strands spike
in a quietus
of their coming.

Braced eight hands high
their tree stands stripped for switches.
Hooves crunch over
hardened circles; scarred shanks stumble
over buried habits,

over silence that swirls
through the leviathan elms.
Beyond, their stalls are empty.
They cannot falter,
not this time.
Chocolate wrappers lie among leaves
and cored apples.

Pushed up from the ground, stalks
lean impuissantly. Egg yolks

dry on car windows, pastelling
the new air. The stuffed men

on porch roofs belly over embryonically,
like the war dead, some decapitated,

their bruised rinds of skulls
battered like pumpkins.

Satan's mask hangs from a phone pole.
The wind embodies it.
Gorgon-headed,
wriggling in the marsh, the growth
dense as the bristles on a sloth's back,

it has nothing but its breadth
of body,
threatening the stammer of minnows
that rush anywhere
from its wake.

When you net one,
its countenance stares you down
on your own soil,

daring the dry air to subsume it,
its gills puffed, haughtily
dethroned. Still it resists,

and in your whole waterless domain
its visage stalks
one like you.
Moving through rooms filled with midnight
I wear my grandfather's robe.
Five years gone he sleeps shoeless, digging into himself,
sorting the dirt damp with let-go roots.
He left his fingers dangling from a thread of this robe,
his slippered wakefulness catching a cat by the scruff,
shuffling across unnailed floorboards;
then feverish throughout his flesh
he turned thin as handkerchiefs.
Tonight I smooth the frayed elbows and knot the rope
stretched loose from a settled waist.
vicariously we walk in the same skin,
the collar goitered from things left unsaid.
The housewalker sleeps with open eyes.
The waitress's hand seems Formica hard.
Erasures from her smile
crease her cheeks without expression.
Conversations run
like broken eggs. From the highway
smoke ushers in
a formless man, his closed lips
telling where he's been.
His blood becomes coffee
in heavy cups.
Tintinnabula lingers
in the ear
and in the bent prongs
of once-stolen forks.
In forgotten sunglasses
neon repeats itself in reverse.
Fingers pass
over initials etched forever
in some dented chrome.
Trees without root; birches arch, crown to dirt,
Scratching hieroglyphs in the snow.
Shrubs ossify; their thickened twigs grit
At the sculpted smoke of branches.

Wires are down, suturing the lacquered stones.
Weighted with absence, clotheslines sag,
Stiffen. The sheets that canopied seedlings
Have shriveled into bruised pears.

All night I heard the splinter of unknown things.
The woods had whitened, shredding into disarray.
Morning cages the window. The suet left for
Grackles stays wrapped to a warped elm.
Deer, entering the field, will leave no prints,
Only hunger when they  leave.
And one, this happened years ago, occurred
With five mares getting electrocuted.
Electrocuted! The milk truck severed
A low-hanging wire, a main line that fed
The house and barn. The sparks it sent up
Made the horses run, frightened, to the fence

(That was barbed), a conductor from the top
To fencepost, and they didn't have a chance.
We found them huddled and scorched, and their eyes
Stared at death the way, I suppose, ours would.
The silence is so loud when something dies,

And it never has come to any good.
Their manes were stiff as bristles, then the boys
Took them to be put away like toys.
Crows bend in the air
like stripped umbrellas.
Fireweed strands into
the forehead of the
clearing ground; acorns
that swelled over a
rainbarrel are the black
pearls that necklace
the lost calf.

Too quick to rot, an
axehandle has been
charred into the shin-
bone of anything that
couldn't leave itself.
Tilted slats are the
tobacco-black teeth
of drunken farmhands.
Their fingers claw at
the weakened boards,
almost anxious
for decay.

A cycle left wedged
in a beam is skinned
in new rust; it cracks
as a boot kicks at it.
Hinges creak louder.
The rickets of old things
make them snap at any sound.
The caught owl swings
pendulously, alive
in its silence and
dead in our hands.
Pressed cider ages
in its vat.
The trees,
varicose,
haven't yet
known their foliage.
Hoarfrost seeps
between slats,
the springhouse
stumped

like a smiling
whittler's
one tooth,

its public road
cow-drawn
stamped down
with crescent hoofs
and wheel ruts
slicing

into a season
that just begins
or ends.
Once twilight
dwindles to a needle's eye
it catches the flower vase, opaque,
a sentinel
on the parlor's coffee table.

There's a smattering --
a constellation settled in the hard-cornered glass,
embering as though it kept camp
with cosmos --
Jupiter rising to a milkweed stem,
and then an eclipse:
a cat's tail passes and darkens
eternity,

but brings with it
stirred dust
and a manifold moon, daguerreotyped,
quartered by translucence,

in its own phases clocking the protracted shadows
lengthened by a lowered shade,
with the universe contained.
Off the turnpike their burial grounds thicken.
Cracked windshields are webbed white,
and grills grin
with rabid iron. Disemboweled engines,
scavenged for parts, spurt frayed wires
draining the last of the anti-freeze.
Bald tires wreath the spaces
where skunks will curl in summer.
Convertibles have couched upon one another,
flat and identical,

while among burnt and rusted doors
a slashed seat sprouts grackles.
In my soapskinned mug the draught's head withers.
The ventilator belches forth no fumes,
and drunken jokes spear the cigar-ash air.
Filled ashtrays overflow
like mushroom gardens untended,
their heads toward some flickering light.

Through neon doors someone  lets the night in;
it no longer stammers,
and among the fresh sawdust
overalls shuttle past
on thick-soled shoes.
In morning light
A moth floats lazily,
Doubling itself over pondwater.
Leafage splits the mossed-over surface
That moves slowly, unwinding
Like threads from a shawl.
Cocoons muscle the overhanging trees
That brush water,
Playing for the sun as it rises
>From the wren's nest
Adamantine with new eyes.
Along the outworn path frogs rest
Under shaded stones,
Their tongues licking at horseflies,
While light commands
Sound and searching, wind and comfort.
And in the thickest of woods
chainsaws hum like bees.

For The One Man Who Likes My Thighs
I want a boyfriend with antlers. 
(I read somewhere if I long in specifics, I'll be more likely 
to get my wish.) A boyfriend like Bambi, he'll be the one for me. 
He'll have sort of a feminine name 
so I won't immediately think of cuss-words and muscles. 
Yet he'll battle for my honor, save my life if he has to. 
And when he fights, he and his opponent will turn into shadow. 
He'll never be offensive. He'll have really good posture, 
hold his head high. He'll look like me, but not cuter: 
I'll have longer lashes and bigger bluer eyes. 
He'll have seen a loved one die, so he'll understand loss 
but will have worked through his grieving by the time we meet. 
Yes, he'll be a prince. He'll think of me only and give me twins 
as calm and easy to take care of as no-iron sheets.
The static cracks like whips over lions 
as the nurse yanks a comb through my hair. 
Since I've come, I'm most interested 
in things that aren't there. 

The trick for remembering opposite colors: 
I stare at the lemon soap dish for hours and blink 
grape-purple dots in the porcelain sink. Then, I scout 
the halls for him. He's Sleeping Beauty and I am the Prince. 

I have some sense that kids don't always live, but he will 
if I visit him, insist that I am too in the sixth, not fourth, grade 
and borrow text books to cinch my new made-up age. 
Mornings he speaks in whispers. His chest barely lifts 

the sheet. Then, at noon, it's time for me to breathe 
into the asthma machine. As the liquid in the cup I hold turns 
to mist, I play with the coils of hose looped in my lap 
and watch the dials to see how many pounds I can breathe. 

I could be testing my strength for him at the carnival game, 
sending a marker up the thermometer-shaped gauge, 
ringing the bell until I'm dizzy with exhales. 
My horizontal boyfriend. He's thirteen and he actually talks to me. 

With my chin on his bed rail, I listen to secrets -- 
his father in a strip joint; "Busty" Somebody 
placed a breast on top of a bald patron's head. 
I wonder about where the contact hasn't been: 

if my hand could fit under his neck, 
through that dark tunnel formed where his scalp hits 
the pillow and where the mattress meets his back. 
I follow the bridge over his lip and plan 

a hazy rescue, a nebulous kiss -- 
It's late and I've snuck into his room. 
He's sleeping; but suddenly I'm not so sure 
what to do. It's the first time 

I've wanted to touch someone and couldn't. 
I'll still see his profile laid out in landscapes, 
the blond snow-dust on his cheek 
by the precipitation of light falling from his humming tv.
In the Stadium Theater, a movie about Santa Claus 
going to the moon in a rocket. My mother doesn't want to see it, 
but takes me after I beg her and beg her. It is the first day 
I'm not wheezing for a while, and she hesitates 
bringing me outside, but we make it. Sudden temperature changes 
can kick me off, like bee stings in summer 
or walnuts in a friend's birthday cake. I know I can die 
any number of ways. I saw a casket the length of my sled 
whisked down the steps of Founier's Funeral Home. I belong 
in a glass globe, where the snow isn't cold, 
where my lungs can't constrict so easily, shying from life. 

I wake up in hospitals sometimes -- my skin, pale green, 
and my mother shows me my face in her compact. 
There is a crayon called seafoam that is the same color. 
The doctors, in fact, say I'd be best off in a boat, far away 
from the shore, because pollens, with their fertile sense 
of direction, have no reason to make it very far into the ocean. 
And it's also best I'm kept where I can't fall. 
I'll never be able to have stitches -- my skin 
will form keloids, too sensitive to heal, and bubble 
like the muciferous coughs I'll never outgrow. 
I'm no pushover, though. I fight, for example, the armada 

of dust mites in my room: plastic over my mattress 
and pillows, the humidifiers, vaporizers, and my stuffed animals 
all bundled up in Glad Wrap. Instead of holding hairy pets, 
I watch fish through a tank. My eyelids and theirs, 
on the look out, and thin as soapsuds... I know how and when 
to take my medicine, but this day I forget, 
so excited about the matinee, a Christmas in the open waters 
of space. During the opening credits I'm silent. I don't want 
to miss a minute by asking my mother for some change 
to buy a soda at the stand, so I pull out my pills 
from my jacket pocket and, without a drink, try to swallow them 

with popcorn. My windpipe retaliates and everything 
is stuck in my throat. I choke, then I throw up. 
The vomit sprays on my sweat shirt, a hand-me-down from my cousin. 
Red and white, it reads, peace love peace love... 
in lots of thin rows that wind all around. 
My mother says, "Why don't you take that thing off?" 
when we get home and she sees the crusty orange stains 
on the front. But I only half-hear her, imagining 
the movie plot I've missed, what the air quality might 
be like inside an astronaut's helmet -- 
and if I could run up a hill if I were weightless.
On Shakti Gawain's self help tape 
she endorses the Pink Bubble Technique -- 
placing our worry in an imaginary dome 
and projecting it out into the universe. 
On the brink of my meditations, I've rocketed 
whole countries, entire banking institutions, 
and my nieces, so they'll be protected 
from drunk drivers and AIDS. I've launched 
the Blue Cross/Blue Shield budget, the security 
of my teaching job. A whole building on 23rd Street -- 
poof! My mother's slipped disc, my father's prostate. 
Pieces of everyone I love 
have been cast upward in a pink bubble 
at least once. 
                     As our troubles lift, getting smaller 
and more distant, Shakti Gawain advises: 
"Now, there's nothing left for you to do." 
Because I'd been taught that the wish, the prayer 
is always enough, I was only partially surprised when 
today, before I reached the sulking cashier 
at the end of a long Dagastino supermarket line, I found myself 
in a pastel air ball, suspended high above Manhattan. 
My friend had been concerned because I'd been looking 
down -- afraid, because of the recession, 
that I'd lose my job. She must have been the one 
to cast me into the floating candy-color womb. 
I was still holding a bunch of bananas 
and a TV Guide I was browsing through but never intended 
to buy. In a bubble hovering near mine 
I saw my landlady Leona Helmsley who had ascended herself. 
There were countless other mini-bubbles 
full of stray kittens and brown and pink babies. 
South America was wedged in an oblong sphere. 
A dolphin, an eagle, a chunk of biopsied breast, 
a coiled colon with hopes of being cancer-free -- 
things people worry about most. 
                                                    I was ashamed 
I'd left dishes in the sink. My papers 
were hardly in order. But because the bubble 
was airtight, doorless, I tried to relax 
as I peeled a piece of the fruit I hadn't paid for. 
I checked my TV Guide horoscope 
for the week ending November 25. Woozy, I saw 
my stolen future, through a gauzy pink concave -- the world 
I, with all the others, was drifting away from. The world 
left, for better, for worse, to fend for itself.
My sister picks up her daughters at the bus stop 
ever since a nine-year-old girl from the neighborhood 
was coaxed into a car by a man 
telling her he'd hit a kitten down the road. 
His story went that the small ball of fur 
ran somewhere near the railroad tracks 
and he needed an extra pair of eyes to find it. 
The girl was smart and had been taught 
everything grownups thought she'd have to know 
about even the worst of strangers, but she wanted 
to be a veterinarian when she grew up. 
And the man looked as though he'd been crying. 
"He had that child in the car four hours," 
my mother tells me, my mother who would cut off his balls 
if she had the chance. She sounds fed up, middle-class, 
when she says it, and I want to say "no," 
but I too share her sentiment. My father 
thinks the rapist deserves worse, to be shot dead -- 
no questions asked. My brother-in-law has a gun, 
and my sister knows he'd use it if anyone tried to touch 
their daughters, my nieces, my parents' grandchildren. 
Four hours is longer than some double features, 
longer than some continental plane rides, 
longer than a whole afternoon in grade school. 
Nothing is slower than time when you're nine years old, 
nothing is more fragile than trust. 
The rapist dropped the girl off at the pizza parlor 
where the men who worked there called an ambulance. 
Before this, my nieces walked the short distance home 
and they protest, wanting to know why they can't anymore. 
The after-school rapist hasn't been caught, 
but the second and fifth grade rumors aren't terrifying enough. 
My sister wonders how to tell her daughters, 
who love small animals and only want to help.
Now the papers are saying pesticides will kill us 
rather than preservatives. I pass the school yard 
where the Catholic girls snack. Cheeze Doodles and apples. 
No parent today knows what to pack in a lunch box 
and the plaid little uniforms 
hold each girl in: lines in the weave cross 
like directions, blurry decisions. 
A supervising nun sinks in her wimple. All the things she can't do, 
she thinks, to save them, her face growing smaller. 
She dodges their basketball. 
Who said the Catholic church has you for life 
if it had you when you were five? I remember my prayers at odd times 
and these girls already look afraid. 
But it's not just the church. It's America. 
I fear the children I know will become missing children, 
that I will lose everyone I need to some hideous cancer. 
I fear automobiles, all kinds of relationships. 
I fear that the IRS will find out the deductions I claimed this year 
I made up, that an agent will find a crumpled draft of this poem 
even if fear edits this line out... I have no privacy, 
no protection, yet I am anonymous. I sometimes think 
the sidewalk will swallow me up. So I know when the girls 
line up to go inside and one screams to her friend 
"If you step on a crack, you'll break your mother's back..." 
she means it. She feels all that responsibility, that guilt. 
There's only one brown girl who doesn't do what she should. 
She's dancing by herself to a song on her Walkman. 
One of her red knee socks bunches at her ankle and slips into her sneaker. 
And the shoulder strap of her jumper has unbuckled so her bib flaps. 
Maybe she can save us. I clutch the school yard's chain link fence. 
Please, little girl, grow up to be pope or president.
They tumble from closing bars into here. 
Uninspired men nicknamed for their hair: 
Whitie, Red; the bald one, Flesh. 

What a way to save to go to Europe. 
But that's what I'm doing, 
the donut waitress taking advantage 
of drunks. I look through 
the fatty blurred window, 
remind them often of my aspirations, 
drum on the counter top: I am not like them. 

Red's got a novelty passport 
and motions me over. He thinks 
his finger's alluring as Cape Cod, 
the farthest I bet he's ever gone. 
"Guess where I've been?" 
he slurs and has me open the blue book. 
A rubber jack-in-the-box penis pops out. 

I think of adding sugar to the diabetics' coffee 
when they laugh, describing their naked wives. 
Twenty-four hours, any day, they know here they can. 
There's not even a lock on the Mr. Donut door. 
SO when there's a fight on the corner, Flesh tells me 
to call the police from the phone in back: 
"If the bikers see you finking, they'll get your ass." 

From behind the muffin case, the motorcycle clash 
looks like a home movie: skipping loops, a volume lapse 
as bikes are kicked over, heads smashed. 
The blood puddles slowly, graying. 
Connie strolls in, her lipstick all crazy: 
the fight's over her. She wants a light. 
I know she'll stain the rim of her cup. 

But they all leave big bills under the saucers 
and I get to read the few 
quiet hours before dawn.
Your mother loomed all hips and breasts, 
big mad curves like boomerangs 
always coming back, while you sat in front of your plate 
taking small bites, chewing a bit, 
then spitting the food back out. 
You were in junior high, starting to read -- 
how women were always on a diet: 
refraining from taking late night walks, restricted 
from getting their own credit cards, maybe working construction. 
That was pop-politics, your mother said 
the day she was tired, and the run in her stocking made her cry. 
You would never be her, you commanded your body 
when you noticed your hip jutting from your waist 
and the first bit of fat on your chest -- 
straining towards that mortal hour glass, 
that sandy digestion. Birds eating rocks 
because they don't have knives or forks. 
"She eats like a god damn bird," your father complained, 
always talking about you in the third person. 
"I don't need anyone," you might have said, over and over, 
sometimes aloud, sometimes to yourself until your periods stopped 
and your breasts flattened back to how they were 
when you were a little girl, running in the front yard 
without a shirt. Until you were in the rehab 
and you realized your bones would never be hollow, 
your hospital smock like a spotless bib tied around your neck. 
"This is no bimbo disease," one nurse said absently to another 
as she hooked you to the tube, a robin feeding its baby 
a worm. And when no one was looking, 
you turned your spiny back to winter, the crack of an open window, 
and tried your best to catch pneumonia. A thin 
coat of feathers grew over you, trying to save you.
A kiss has nothing to do with sex, 
she thinks. Not really. That engulfing, that trying to take 
all of another in for nourishment, to become one with her, to become 
part of her cells. The way she must have had everything she wanted 
in the womb, without asking. Without words, 
kisses have barely the slurp-sound of a man entering a woman 
or sliding back out -- neither movement with even the warning of a bark. 
The Greek word "buli," animal hunger. 
Petting, those kisses are called, or sometimes necking. 
She read this advice in a sex manual once: "Take the man's penis, 
slowly at first, like you are licking melting ice cream 
from the rim of a cone." But the gagging, the choke -- 
a hot gulp of tea, a small chicken bone, a wad of gum grown too big. 
That wasn't mentioned. It's about what happens in her mouth 
past her teeth, where there is no more control, like a waterfall -- 
or it being too late when the whole wedding cake is gone: 

She orders one from a different bakery this time, so no one 
will remember her past visits and catch on. She's eating 
slowly at first, tonguing icing from the plastic groom's feet, the hem 
of the bride's gown, and those toothpick-points that kept them 
rooted in pastry. She cuts the top tier into squares, 
reception-like.   (The thrill she knew of a wedding this past June, 
stealing the white dessert into her purse, sucking 
the sugary blue gel from a napkin one piece was wrapped in. 
She was swallowing paper on her lone car ride home, 
through a red light, on her way to another nap 
from which she hoped a prince's kiss would wake her.) 

The second tier in her hands, by fistfuls, desperate 
as the Third World child she saw on tv last week, taking in gruel. 
Her head, light like her stomach is pumped up with air. 
She can't stop. She puckers up to the sticky crumbs under her nails. 
Then there are the engraved Valentine candies; 
CRAZY, DREAM GIRL, ACT NOW, YOU'RE HOT. She rips open the bag, 
devouring as many messages as she can at once. 
They all taste like chalk. She rocks back and forth. 
She has to loosen the string on her sweat pants, part of her trousseau. 
The bag of candy is emptied. The paper doily 
under the cake's third layer, smooth as a vacuumed ice-skating rink. 
What has she done? In the bathroom, like what happened 

to the mistakenly flushed-away bracelet, a gift 
from her first boyfriend -- the gold clasp silently unhooking 
as she wiped herself, then, moments too late, noticing 
her naked wrist under the running water of the rest room 
sink's faucet...She's learned it's best to wait ten minutes 
to make herself throw up. Digestion begins at this point, 
but the food hasn't gotten very far. As ingeneous as the first 
few times she would consciously masturbate, making note of where 
her fingers felt best, she divises a way to vomit 
that only hurts for a second. 

She takes off her sweatshirt and drapes it over a towel rack. 
Then she pokes a Q-Tip on her soft pallet. Keeping in mind 
the diagram in her voice class, the cross section 
of the mouth showing each part's different function, 
the pallet -- hidden and secret as a clitoris. 
The teacher's mentioning of its vulnerability, split-second 
and nonchalant like a doctor and his tongue depressor. 
It's a fast prayer -- she kneels in front of the toilet. 
Her back jerks and arches the way it n-dght 
if she were moving her body to meet a man's during intercourse. 
She wipes what has sprayed back to her chest, 
her throat as raw as a rape that's happened to someone else. 
She cleans the seat of the bowl with a rag, and cleans 
her teeth with a second toothbrush she keeps for this purpose. 
Her sweatshirt back on, she gets to the kitchen 
to crush the cake box into a plastic garbage bag. 
And leaves to dispose of it, not in the trashcan downstairs, 
but in a dumpster way on the other side of town.
The troublemaker has become a monk. 
No longer able to push the puny boys down the stairs, 
torture the wearers of glasses and braces 
or set fire to anyone's locker, 
he says an invocation before our meal. 
It's been ten years 
and none of the cheerleaders are as fat 
as we had hoped, but pretty Suzy is skinnier 
than we could have imagined. 
One of her arms is covered 
by the long sleeve of her sequined gown, 
and the other is bare -- cavewoman-style. 
Suzy's perfect teeth seem to have grown yellow and pointed. 
It is rumored that her track-star-husband beats her. 
The locals say his name has been in the paper, more than once, 
for drugs. I imagine him asking her 
which shoulder will be hidden in her asymmetrical dress, 
where else he can safely punch. The troublemaker monk 
might hear the track-star's confession, 
then say, sadly, he understands. 
Suzy dances like it's not very fun, 
with none of the energy she used 
to scoot to the top of a pyramid of other girls, 
her saddle shoes firmily planted on the backs 
of their maroon and gold uniforms. 
Her legs barely shook and her arms belted out 
as though she were singing an opera. 
When her husband says she doesn't deserve any dessert, 
we feel the guilt of wishing her those extra pounds, 
of wishing Suzy any harm at all
Consider the gall of the bullfrog, 
throatily calling at night for a mate, 
longing for a kiss from a Beauty 
that could change his fate. Some say a frog 
is the male sex. And girls 
who kindly put their lips to its 
are promised to get over their fears. 
But what about the cowfrog? 
No mammary glands, no sweet milk, all her eggs 
outside herself -- not a frog in history 
ever turned into a princess by a peck 
on the cheek from an innocent boy, 
as though female royalty and luck 
sprout from other stuff. Once, before the Ranidae 
were green and slimy, a young she-frog, 
acting on impulse, shyly flirted with a prince. 
She batted her eyes, big and bright as flash bulbs, 
but, busily adjusting his white mink capelet, 
the prince said to someone in his court, 
"Get this commoner out of here! Does she not realize 
such a scandal could cost me my throne?!" 
And like St. Brigid, the defeated she-frog 
might have mumbled, "Please God, 
make me ugly, so I will no longer tempt men. 
So I will no longer be tempted." 
As though for a cowfrog, a would-be princess, 
desire itself is shameful.
I still remember John Nickels poking me 
in the stomach, then putting his arm around my waist, saying, 
"Hey, I like your style." A seventh-grade tingle 
went through me like a potion. 
I just had vague notions of sex and orgasm, my only analogy: 
a pebble ripple in water. 
And, though the flutter lasted long after, I missed him. 
He barely spoke to me again. 
He'd avert his eyes as I came down the hall 
like it was all too much for him to bear -- 
A poke, we both knew, was a promise, a commitment. 
He must have thought he'd turn into a frog or something if he'd admit it.
Walking home through the woods from a movie at the plaza 
that I didn't remember minutes after it ended, 
an action adventure that I didn't want to see, but said yes to 
just in case you held my hand, and you did. 
Walking home by the shortcut, the path 
the developers made because they'd be building houses soon, 
we had nothing to say. It was our first date 
and you stopped to kiss me, the cold of the mud 
wetting my feet. Your tongue, like an animal's 
rough and eager, through the chain link of a zoo's fence. 
I didn't know you, but you put your hands up my shirt 
like it was nothing to either of us. 
You cupped each of my breasts as though holding me back, 
or measuring me for something, then kept walking, 
not taking my hand anymore. Even at fifteen, 
I knew you were the type that after the first kindnesses, 
the honeymoon was over. Your face in the night 
was even flatter, less pronounced than it was in the light. 
I knew, before this, that I didn't love you or even want 
to talk to you the next day in school. 
I told my girlfriends you weren't very smart. You took shop 
and fixed cars with your dad, not even the intricacies 
under the hood, just body work. And when I went to that garage 
in your back yard because we were going to another movie 
and your mother said I should get you 
so we wouldn't be late, I saw calendar pages curling under a picture 
of a topless woman in short-shorts. She was holding a wrench 
to her lips. Your dad looked at me the same way you did, 
but that was how I wanted to be looked at then -- that was how 
I thought it should be. You washed the grease from your hands, 
wiped your brow with your forearm and were ready. A few dates later 
I held your penis as though it were a science experiment 
and put it in my mouth when you asked. A kind of aspic squirted out. 
I swallowed like a brave girl, taking her medicine.
Sex was as beautiful as flowers. 
The orchid unfolding between his legs, 
the baby's breath on his chest, 
the blue bells under his arms. 
Tea roses on your nightgown, 
and, of course, you would have wanted him: 
the only boy at camp 
who didn't vie to tie your underwear to a tree, 
who instead folded it neatly and hid it 
so you'd later find it under your pillow. 
Although he could have, he didn't follow tradition 
and read your letters -- he secured them, 
along with your diary, between your mattress 
and the cot springs. The only boy who gave you privacy. 
So you gave him yourself. At sixteen, 
you'd collected all the pamphlets. You knew 
about the pill, nonoxynol-9 and condoms. 
Still, sex was as delicate as flowers. 
An infection, like the limp cactus 
I watered too much in the glass terrarium 
my first boyfriend gave me. 
Maybe your sex could not take so much love. 
Maybe your sex needed to be diluted 
with sketchier pasts, a stronger fear of AIDS, 
a few more seeds of mistrust. Or maybe, 
more simply, it wasn't your fault. Chlamydia 
is easily treated, the doctor assures you 
although now your mother must know 
and your father, too, with whom you haven't spoken 
in months. I stood holding you once 
when you were just a baby, your diaper 
in the crook of my elbow, and I was counting 
the days, longing to be a teenager. 
I said I had the back of your head 
with my other hand, no problem, 
because I really thought I had -- and, besides,
anyone could take care of a little kid. 
But when I took my hand away from your neck 
just a second, you flipped backwards 
like a blossoming bud a movie camera had captured 
on high-speed film. Your mother caught you 
and held you for the rest of the day. 
The doctor says you are not pregnant, 
the yellow pollens whirling 
outside the girls' tent. The sleeping bags 
stacked and rolled up tight 
like the whorls of petals, rolled up unfairly tight 
and meant only for one.
The longing we know that does not have a name 
may be for our lost twins, our cellular siblings 
who flaked away from us 
only days after our conception. 
Like a singular petal tugged from its floribunda, 
most of us were left alone in our planet-wombs, 
gravity-less balloons, loose space suits. Galaxies of mother 
around us, we slept the way I still like to: 
my back nestled against someone else's chest, 
my knees bent and at rest on his 
as though I were sitting in a chair 
but my weight askew, pulled away to a 90-degree angle. 
No wonder, regardless of who it is, 
love is what I feel every time. 
He is my lost one, my lost twin, 
the dolphin, the underwater uterine-angel 
who loved me regardless, who continued
to swim up against me, whether I pulled away or not. 
I miss him the way a soldier 
has a phantom itch on the elbow 
of his amputated arm. I look into mirrors 
and dress up as someone else. 
Our lost Gods are so hard to find 
though they are as many 
as the flakes of novelty confetti 
that snow from a bridal shower bell. 
Or the pastel dots 
that rise to the roof and multiply 
on this city bus 
as the sun hits a stone 
on some piece of jewelry a passenger is wearing. 
The magic blinks away as we turn the corner 
and a building's shadow takes over. 
We all check our watches 
and bracelets, wondering which one of us 
could have been the source 
of such beauty. The travelers who saw 
look at each other to confirm. 
Our lost Gods, so hard to find -- 
their appearances so short, their bodies so small.
I see so many things, a primitive ring, 
a nest with a fallen-out bottom, 
a white rubber band snapped into blue. 
But mostly it's real memory 
and the doctor holding up my x-ray 
to the screen of light, a mini drive-in. 
The bone was mine -- big, oblong 
and intact, even though my skin was purple, 
my muscles sore. I'd fallen 
off of Matthew's ten speed. 
There were whispers that my hymen was probably gone, 
first broken by the cross bar 
that separates a boy's bike from a girl's, 
rather than by Matthew himself. And now the x-rays 
were showing my ready pelvis, an empty hammock, 
just waiting for a sticky fetus sucking its thumb. 
"It's beautiful," the doctor said 
admiring my illuminated centerfold-skeleton 
before he turned to me, the real -- and therefore 
less interesting -- thing. He smiled: 
"You have the perfect hip bones, miss, 
for carrying babies." To my mother, he said, 
"If everything else inside her is OK, someday 
she'll be in labor for no more than an hour." 
I was thirteen and I wanted no baby, 
only a boyfriend, only some petting. 
I wasn't even sure how I felt 
about tongues. My favorite game was 
swimming deep underwater, kicking through 
a tent of spread legs, scissoring my thighs 
in short quick ups and downs so I wouldn't lose 
by booting someone in the crotch. 
"But I don't want a baby," I might have said aloud. 
The doctor and my mother might have conspiratorially laughed. 
My pelvis was as white as the ones Georgia painted, 
except the weather surrounding hers 
was robin egg-hopeful. 
My bone was a whorl in an x-ray-gray storm. 
My disembodied pelvis, like a melted hoola hoop, 
a coiling snake meeting itself, a lasso 
without the rope of control to catch what I wanted. 
"The women in our family are all Fertile Myrtles," 
my mother explained later, when I changed my mind, and tongues 
and other appendages boys had 
become more to my liking. "When I got 
pregnant with you, I think I was just 
looking at your father," she said as emphatically 
as if she were telling me the truth. So I found out how to get 
a diaphragm and pills and foams and condoms and used them 
all at once, memorizing the percentages 
of their individual effectiveness: 80, 82, 89.5. 
"I'm pregnant, I just know it," 
I would panic every month, my pelvis 
a nebulous halo, a loose fitting noose. 
Exasperated, my first real boyfriend would remind me, 
"Impossible. We didn't even have intercourse last month. 
Remember? You were too nervous." In the meantime, 
my girlfriends, one by one, skipped their periods. 
There were trips for abortions or quick marriages. 
One young mother left high school 
to become a cashier at the Stop & Shop. 
While she was still nursing, she leaked milk 
through her shirt and smock, leaving 
something like a perspiration spot 
every time a baby cried in her line. 
This wasn't for me, though I felt guilty, 
my pelvis being the right shape and all. 
My mother watched her talk shows, sometimes 
on the topic of childless women, and muttered, 
"How can those career ladies be so selfish? 
If they don't have babies now, 
they'll grow old and die alone." 
Sometimes in my dreams I'm back on Matthew's bike, 
not falling this time, but riding off 
into the orange-cowboy sunset. Other times, 
though, a crown of thorns sprouts in my belly -- 
my nightmare grows dark. 
It is always daylight around Georgia's Pelvises. 
The sky is the blue that the child she might have had 
might have seen when she was first born. 
Sometimes I dream bluebirds land on my hipbone 
as though I were a round limb 
on a desert tree. I feed them anything 
they desire. Then the mother birds 
feed their youngsters, and I tell them 
they can stay as long as they like.
Every Saturday the saxophone sage 
plays in front of Chelsea 2nd Hand Guitars. 
Each wordless chorus is his testament, as tragic 
and purple as bruises, as alluring 
as a woman's bare shoulders. 
Every Saturday I listen to the musician's wisdom: 
that he is gold and she is wood, 
that he is one and she is all. He has his reasons 
for playing in front of the guitar store -- 
the actuality and reflections of acoustic hips 
surrounding him like halos of protection 
from the blows of the world. 
He doesn't want to fight. He'd rather slow everything down 
and let us all rest after each tumble. So sure am I 
that his voice will sound exactly like the swimming teacher 
who taught me to dive, I never wait around 
long enough for him to speak. 
Between songs, the saxophone player silently wipes his forehead 
like he's tackled the hardest lessons in a book. 
The silver coins against the red velvet insides of his case 
glint like blushes of afterglow in an unlikely bed. 
Between his songs, the silence 
of the city is so full and tenuous 
that it can't be called silence at all, 
but rather the sound after great sex, 
the sound before a great war.
My first boyfriend is dead of AIDS. The one 
who bought me a terrarium with a cactus 
I watered until it became soft. The one 

who took me to his junior high school prom where I was shy 
about dancing in public. The one who was mistaken 
for a girl by a clerk when he wanted to try on a suit. 

In seventh grade my first boyfriend and I looked a lot alike: 
chubby arms, curly hair, our noses touching 
when we tried our first kiss. My first boyfriend 

was the only one who met my grandmother 
before she died. Though, as a rule, she didn't like boys, 
I think she liked my first boyfriend. 

My first boyfriend and I sat in the back seat 
of my mother's car, and on the ledge behind us 
was a ceramic ballerina with a missing arm. 

We were driving somewhere to have her repaired 
or maybe to buy the right kind of glue. 
My first boyfriend was rich and had horses 

and airplanes he could fly by remote control. 
My first boyfriend died on a mattress 
thrown in the back of a pick-up 

because the ambulance wouldn't come. 
There was a garden in my first boyfriend's yard. 
One day his mother said to us, 

"Pick out some nice things for lunch." 
My first boyfriend and I pulled at the carrot tops, 
but all that came up were little orange balls 

that looked like kumquats without the bumps. 
My first boyfriend and I heard ripping through the soil 
that sounded close to our scalps, like a hair brush 

through tangles. We were the ones who pushed 
the tiny carrots back down, hoping that they were able 
to reconnect to the ground. We were the ones.
Once, late at night my lover and I drove into the desert. 
He was a geologist and, in his pickup, 
he told me not to worry so much about the end of the world: 
humans were too egotistical for their own good. 
If Shakespeare and skyscrapers were lost, 
really -- so what? Around us 
the saguaros were straining against crucifixion. 
I marveled, to myself, the sparkling of the stars. 
The farthest I'd ever gotten away was in orgasm, 
the ones that rolled on and on. 
                         This was the beginning 
of my knowing something about the rest of it -- 
that maybe it wasn't safe to leave, or if I did find a good escape, 
I'd never be able to take everyone with me. 
So as his tongue was lapping me softly, 
like a dog's, like a best friend who loved me, I had to tell him 
it wasn't his fault that I could not come, that I could not go -- 
the desert air wrapped around us just so,
my back against the corrugated bed of his truck -- 
It's just 
that I was thinking of his friend, 
the woman who claimed to see auras and who 
actually witnessed her husband's 
puff into nothingness as he stepped into a malfunctioning elevator 
and dropped to his death. I asked my lover 
if he thought that his friend was making this up. 
His patient hand ran over my collarbone 
and felt for a pulse on my neck. 
Suddenly happy 
to be caught in a life-giving trap, I saw 
around us, a party of one-size-fits-all souls 
carrying on, dancing like there was no territory to speak of, 
dancing like there would definitely be a tomorrow. 
The desert rippled like my boyfriend's truck 
was a mere rock plopped into a vast body of water. 
The shapes multiplied like Jesus's fish, 
like neighbors, like light-oblivion shadows.
I call the police to report the bruises, on my way to work buy a few boxes of cookies, but as soon as I can, believe me, I quit. Bill, again, is climbing the fence, running into the street from what he's become. His skin, which discolors so easily, shows every mark. He's just beginning to sprout patches of moustache and beard, to resent being the oldest kid here, and knowing his mother and father are brother and sister. His eyes stare bland as tap water. 

****

Coco's, Tucson's family restaurant, is giving out kids' paper hats. When I go there for breakfast, I ask for one and keep it in my sock drawer. 

****

Meg and Angela, the other teachers, line up the kids to come in. It's too hot for the after-school group to be crying, though nothing can muddy the playground dust. Some choke as it's spanked off with the big brush. 

****

Bill's mother wears a Circle K smock and his father, a Seven Eleven cap. The only parents who come in together: they see a lust in my smile when I ask if I can take Bill to a matinee on Sunday. If I interfere, his mother says -- she draws on her lips -- she'll kill me. 

****

The nightmares are starting to come back. I try to find a therapist, but the only clinic I can afford has a man and he asks, "How does this make you feel, being five minutes late? Is this a pattern? Are you addicted to drugs? Do you drink? Were you ever abused?" 

****

Angela really cares for the children. One night it's two hours since all the others have gone. Still no one has come for Dana whose mother calls and says everyone is tied up. So Angela keeps Dana overnight at her house and Mary Moppet's finds out. Dana's stepfather always comes now exactly at closing, drunk. He knows he'll be charged a dollar each minute he's late from here on. The daycare, he grumbles, just wants to make a fast buck. 

****

In one of my favorite movies, Atlantic City, Susan Sarandon's character washes herself with lemons after working at an oyster bar. I try to find something like that for me to do. I get tanner and blonder as I sit my free afternoons by the Prince Garden complex pool. 

One day a married man asks me how I am adjusting to Tucson. His wife is pregnant with their first child. I don't know him well. He says we should go for a drink. 

****

Everything at Mary Moppet's is starting to have a form. How big the burn mark determines where Sandy is sent. If it's smaller than my thumb, her parents have to take "how to be a parent" classes. Bigger, she's sent to a foster home and her real mother or father can't sign her out. A record is kept of subsidized suppers: macaroni and cheese, barely drained canned peas. No refills -- there's inventory -- for milk spilled. 

****

There's a naked man, except for underwear tied on his head like a mask. The light bulb I'd left on over my door has burnt out. And past the dirt driveway lined with cactus is the prickly field where I could have been dragged, where I could have been mangled, where he could have done all the terrible things to me he was mumbling. 

The moon above is but a slice of anyone's terror -- Sandy's or Dana's. I crush his hand in the door, keep slamn-ting it with my hip and somehow hook the chain. I'm afraid to turn on the lights so I get a kitchen knife and feel in the dark for the phone. The first time I dial the police, not a sound will come out. And I'm sure I could say even less if more happened. I push the table in front of the door. 

****

Meg is in a rock band and, when she dyes her hair calico, some of the parents complain she's unfit. One Halloween, she brings in face paint and does up the children with it. Mother after father threaten it better come off. 

****

My sister has her second baby, Katie. She calls from Massachusetts and says the labor was easy. I'm glad she didn't have a boy. To me, everything male has begun to look ugly. Even the lie of protection, of kindness: the way the lock thrusts its bolt from the door into the jamb. I constantly check to make sure it's in and hear every noise when I'm in bed or taking a shower. My robe hangs on a hook like a torn bouquet of flowers. 

****

The toddlers stay penned in with their shit. Diapers are changed only every three hours. Spitty blocks are dumped in piles on the floor and Tex is always draining his playmates' bottles. At rest time, we put down mats and pin blankets over the windows to shut out the sun. In the grayish light, small figures slump down. "When nap?" some children even ask as though this is a favorite slot of their days. 

****

It is easier for the teachers to escape. We get passes to go dancing at "Cowboys." We're extras in a made-for-tv movie once: Star Struck produced by Dick Clark. We sit at a set bar and watch a soap opera actress's all-girl band, nudge each other on the shoulders or elbows, point, and look like we're having fun. 

****

The police send helicopters out the night that guy tried to attack me, but never find him. I hunt like a detective for men with bandages on their right hands long after his would have healed, long after I move away from Tucson. The cop that comes to take the report at the complex says, if this ever happens to you again, you should never run home; now he knows where you live; instead, run to the street where there's traffic, some stores; surely, someone will help you. 

****

Meg leaves Mary Moppet's when she gets enough gigs. Angela goes to Mexico. She's getting married, wants kids of her own.
My mother drags her money across the street 
from Old Colony to Fleet National Bank 
because she reads Old Colony has been having trouble 
collecting property loans. What if the bank had closed? 
What if there were big day-glo letters 
slapped over the hours telling her so? 

What would my mother have had to do to get her money? 
It says on the door deposits 
are federally insured up to an amount 
she has a lot less of. But how long 
would the reimbursement have taken? How many forms? 
She knows the government. She was born 

at the tail end of the Depression, her childhood 
was the Second World War. She knows 
from raising her own family 
about meat-stretchers, how to sew. She knows 
about wanting, about lies, although with babies in diapers 
and working full time, she can barely recall 

Vietnam. She's saved all these years, but now 
she can't get on the plane to Florida. 
She doesn't want me to go on vacation to California 
because of the quakes. She doesn't want me 
to ride the subways, or, for that matter, live in New York 
at all. She'd find me a job in a small place 

with a small husband. 
The way she lives is a little safer 
though there are murders, too, in our hometown, 
and last year some teenagers broke in 
in the middle of the afternoon, 
when she was home. In her dream, my father dies 

and on one will help her cut the lawn. 
I am gone, as is my sister. 
When she asks the children 
on the street, says she'll pay them, 
they just laugh at her. She looks in the phone book 
under hired help, 

but in typical dream-fashion, 
the letters and numbers all blur. 
When my mother attempts to call the operator, 
the touch-tone buttons melt 
under the heat of her index finger. 
From one window, she sees the grass has grown 

as high as the trees 
and from another, there is a drift of snow 
blocking her entire view. 
As though her dream is real, 
I tell my mother: Do not worry. 
If it comes to that, I will mow the yard, I will shovel, 

but she is silent, knows this is false comfort. 
I'm too far. But the phones will always work, 
I assure her, I am only a train ride away. 
My own dreams are full of AIDS -- 
My friends topple, slowly, in pain. 
And my mother and father, in the ones 

where they're still alive, 
go to banks where their cards have been revoked, 
their PIN numbers have been brainwashed 
out of their heads. I can't help 
because there are no more trains, 
mail carriers, planes, Western Union. 

"It is the end of the world as we know it," 
a singer is singing the same song, 
except all the lyrics are different, unrecognizable 
to me because there is no more English. 
Locks and owning anything is forbidden. 
"My narents have been through enough!" 

I am screaming. The streets are cobblestone 
and dark. Soldiers are hiding in dumpsters, 
between slats of scaffolding surrounding construction. 
When I wake the first time, I am sitting 
in a rocking chair. My mother's head rests 
on my right knee, my father's on my left.
David didn't come to school Tuesday, 
the day his essay was due. 
Instead the police showed up -- 
a Dragnet team -- asking if anyone 
had seen him since Friday. 
The class huddled at the implications 
of the words: missing person. 
David, eighteen, too old for milk cartons, 
but just ripe for the morgue 
and a numbered tag around his bare toe. 
Just ripe for a knife, a bullet, 
a bat. He was gentle, small enough to be raped 
then stored in a car trunk 
if there was time, or left on a subway platform 
with his empty wallet by his head. 
When I called his mother the next day 
the phone didn't ring a full ring before she picked it up. 
Not having slept, she couldn't remember her address 
when I said David's English class 
wanted to send her a card. 
She said David was the first of his family 
to go to college. I told her he wrote 
beautiful essays, then I said, "I mean, he writes
beautiful essays," trying to keep him alive 
by using present tense. When he showed up 
to class on Thursday, we all thought we were seeing 
his ghost. Blue bruises tinted his black forehead, 
like a halo collapsing inward. 
He said he'd been arrested in East New York, 
and we all clapped because he was still alive. 
He told the story -- stopped as a passenger 
in a stolen car, which, of course, turned out 
not to be stolen after all. 
"Run, so I can shoot you, nigger," 
a police man said to David 
who shook and whirled inside 
like a blender. He had to concentrate 
on his feet, keeping them steady 
so there'd be no mistake about any sudden movements. 
He was tossed in a cell, questioned 
about the two hundred dollars in his front pocket 
since he was on his way to buy his girlfriend 
a ring for her birthday. The white cops 
made fun of his musk oil, stepped on his sunglasses 
though, he was assured later, this was by mistake. 
Though everyone in America is still entitled 
to that cliched one call, this particular jail 
in East New York didn't have a pay phone 
that worked. David cried into his cot, 
and the guard called him a mama's boy, 
hitting him, heel of his palm to David's head. 
No phone, they laughed the first 48 hours, 
and the tri-state Dragnet team took two more days 
after that to find him, even though 
he was in one of their own jails. 
David told us his story Thursday morning, 
and to cut the tension I said he could have an extension 
on his paper. He said not to worry, 
he had a good lawyer from Jacoby and Meyers. 
Those of the class who knew better groaned. 
"You need a great lawyer," I said. 
"An expert in civil suits -- you could sue the city. 
Just think of the psychological damages 
to your family alone." Then someone in the back row 
held up The Post, the front page declaring 
the jury had acquitted 
the policemen who'd beaten Rodney King. 
We all knew what we had seen -- 
yet today's paper seemed less real, 
more frightening than the video tape. 
I wrote the words irony and metaphor 
in big block letters on the chalk board. 
David stood up and bowed, 
the best of definitions we could come up with.
The cashier who usually winks at me was watching the hanging tv over my shoulder -- Kojak or something like that. And a cat sat on the counter. A little boy was asking for cigarettes for his mother when I heard a gun shot, a little loud, I thought, for a tv. Then, no, it can't be. On Avenue B the first bullet missed, but as I turned to the window the second one got him and a man went soaring and flopped onto the sidewalk as though it were his bed and he'd had a long day. The little boy was looking, too, out through the door where his head only reached Pull spelled backwards. He started screaming when the cashier said, "Hey, I know that guy," and I had to stop the little boy from running out to the street where a mob was forming. The assailant ran and took a right onto the block where I live, and others began running, too. 

It was only five in the afternoon -- a mother would send a boy to the store. We heard more distant shooting, then the squealing ambulance, cop cars in the rain. The police moved a little tired, a little afraid. One came into the Deli asking, what did he look like? Spanish, male, a jean coat, I ventured 5'8", but added that I'm really a bad judge of height. The cashier said nothing about this guy looking familiar and the little boy just wanted to go home. The policeman said, "Little man, why don't you give us a few minutes to find the bad guy before you come on outside." So I bought this boy a bag of popcorn, lifted him up onto the counter where he sat and stroked the cat. We both watched through the glass, and he said he felt OK now, that it was kind of like watching tv.
He hopes I'm not squeamish about scars. 
His long-sleeved arm, where he's been shot 
by two bullets. Two hints 
of what lies beyond his cuff: scars 
on the flip side of his palm 
like grooves on a record album, the thick grooves 
that separate songs. I assure him 
I'm not easily shocked -- why, when I was ten 
I was bitten by a dog. See, the pink slug 
below my shoulder that never healed quite right. 

When he takes off his shirt, the graphs 
on both of his arms are like two big kissing fish -- 
fish almost the size of each of my hands, 
the fins fanning away, outlined 
by big cross stitches, the symbol 
for kisses closing a letter. 
The fish scales, unevenly dimpled, 
like scraps of persistent wallpaper 
during a renovation. Still, he says, 
the doctors did a good job. 

When I touch the fish, he says they don't hurt. 
And there's something of a coin slot 
on his stomach where the second bullet, 
having gone through his arm, grazed. 
And then on his leg, a lighter patch 
as though someone has clouded him with a chalk eraser. 
This skin was taken from here, 
he explains, for his arm. And, on his back, 
another impression, where he was stabbed, 
but that happened when he was a kid. 

He once beat up someone who teased him, 
then took all his money. He's rigged candy machines 
to drain out the change. And long ago, 
he tied up someone who took his stereo. 
I want to know if he's ever stolen a car. 
He hasn't, and those mini-crimes 
only really happened, he says, 
at the first of his adolescence, 
marveling at his new bigness -- no longer 
the little Black Jerry Lewis

without rights to even his own bike 
once the boy next door got a hold of it. 
But yesterday, when in a dispute 
for a New York City parking space, 
he stepped out of his car, 
and the leery contender drove off. 
This isn't the kind of thing I usually admire -- 
the people who push their weight around 
are hardly ever the people I know. Yet, for a moment, 
I felt the thrill, vicariously the bully. 

But what of the safety implications for me? 
Blond, a woman vs. black, a man. 
Then, before I get more scared for one of us 
than the other, I remember his story of the line-up, 
to identify the smirking guy who shot him, 
the frustration of a dividing two-way mirror. 
The months of physical therapy for him 
to be able to produce a legible signature, 
just because of his hesitation to give up his wallet, 
in the dark, on 11Oth Street, in August.
for Phil
That's the way it started. 
Split-second brown-outs in his kitchen 
as his mother made him his favorite sandwich, 
then later a flicker 
in a neighbor's lamp. He was like Harold 
and his Purple Crayon, 
but backwards -- 
things blackening into nothing 
when he thought about them. 
When his friends said that this darkness 
never came to them, the boy who dimmed light bulbs 
realized he was different. He told himself 
maybe he'd outgrow it in his adolescence, 
but didn't. A night beyond his curfew 
he walked the long way home in Smithtown, 
each suburban street light 
blinking off as he passed. 
All becoming part of the background night. 
No stars, the length of Long Island 
a velvet gloved finger, 
what his shadow would have been like 
if he had stopped to pause 
and the watts had stayed on. 
His teachers said he had no other choice 
but to become an artist, 
so he moved away from home 
to Manhattan. He sublet an apartment 
on the Lower East Side 
and the radiators started to spit 
and crackle like the teeny dots 
of gunpowder sold to kids on red paper strips. 
A girl on the steps to his building 
played with them all day, her mission 
to get at something, to free 
the small sulfur ghosts.
More than envious, sometimes the man, 
who as a boy dimmed light bulbs 
and didn't know many girls, 
paused and watched her 
as she let off her steam. 
Next, fuses started to blow, 
and a fire began when he tried to iron 
a shirt for his waitering job. 
The City of New York made the landlord 
of the building he lived in 
rewire the property, 
and the boy who grew into a man 
without outgrowing his tendency 
to dim light bulbs 
muttered under his breath 
that it wasn't his fault. He hadn't painted 
anything yet, though he still 
told everyone who asked that he was an artist. 
His tv split in the middle 
like it had been hit by lightning, 
and he was only looking 
at the TV Guide. He went to four churches 
and the offering candles 
were instantly snuffed. He went to a nutritionist
who said he should stay away 
from high-energy foods 
and slowly sip drinks whipped in a blender. 
Then he went to a shrink 
who asked about his mother. 
The man who had dimmed light bulbs, 
not only as a boy, said maybe, 
now as he thought about it, 
he did have one resentment. 
He told about those liver sandwiches 
he only said were his favorites 
to make his mother happy, 
but that really made him sick. 
The shrink said not to separate 
the boy who dimmed lightbulbs 
from the man who dimmed them still 
as he reached in his pocket 
for a cigarette. The shrink 
asked the boy/man if he minded 
if he smoked, but didn't wait 
long enough for an answer 
before rubbing the tiny wheel 
of his Bic lighter. Shards 
of light bulb fell like slices of snow. 
And both hot and cold, 
the Fifth Avenue office 
went up in flames, then the hall, 
the elevator, the whole floor. 
The boy who dimmed light bulbs 
cleared his throat.
My father slides into third base 
and falls on the sandy pavement of the street 
where we play kick-ball. The varicose veins 
in his legs leap like frogs who can't get out, 
and his knee is skinned like a kid's. 
"I'm fine, I'm fine," he says, heading into the house. 
"You finish out the game. That's an order." 
The neighborhood kids adjust, call someone else 
up to kick, and put back the cardboard base 
my father's spill has misplaced. 
But my concentration is lost. Is my father 
washing his wound thoroughly enough? 
I bet he doesn't know where the Band-Aids are. 

My father continues to fall, in replay fashion, 
as I watch him a few days later in his hospital bed. 
The fluid in his inner ear, waving 
and whacking him out of balance. He says 
it was like he'd just hopped off of a spinning whirligig 
when, at work, he went to wipe his hands on his apron 
and the bakery ovens were suddenly on the ceiling. 
When he collapsed, he thought he was bracing himself 
against the wall. A spinning screen, a time-lapse in a movie. 
When he was on the ambulance stretcher, he says, 
he was better, clutching on to the side's metal bar. 
But it was, for him, the ledge of a building's roof 
because his left and right had become up and down. 

On our next visit, my mother tells us in the hospital elevator 
not to cry or stare at the tubes and graphs 
on the monitors. My father claims this time 
he's feeling quite well -- we didn't even have to come. 
He has the chilling confidence of my sister who will, 
in a few years, wake up from a coma, 
after her car accident, and answer, when asked, 
that her name is Michele and she's seven: 
"Now, where's the peanut butter ice cream?" 
Over the next couple of days, she'll age herself back 
to eighteen. And my father, too, will soon loosen his grip 
on the empty food tray suspended above his counterpane. 
For now, it's the safety bar on his roller coaster car. 

And each time his family visits, his wife and daughters 
inch their way down the wall, eventually 
crossing the corner of the L and standing on the floor. 
His disease is rare, the specialists say. 
So when my father sleeps after his medicine, 
I study one of his ears for something out of place. 
The C of his helix is perfect, the antihelix 
tucked neatly beneath, and the concha 
winding down smaller into that dark canal 
where his trouble lies so deep, even the light 
of a doctor's speculum can't reach it. Maybe there's something 
like an air bubble, adrift as it might be 
in a carpenter's level when his line is slightly crooked. 

I ask my mother to explain to me again why ears pop 
during a hilly car ride, why sometimes my ears ring when I sneeze. 
Can he drive? Can he read? Can it happen again? 
That top setting itself into twirling...Not much difference now, 
for my father, between the sky and the lake. He walks with a cane, 
aiming for what he thinks is his destination, 
training himself to then go twenty degrees to the left. 
In this world of gravity and one-way streets, my father wanders, 
refusing any help. And as though his topsy-turviness 
is passed on in my genes, I stand, in a window -- 
more like a mother than a daughter -- trying to let go: 
my father shovels the driveway, his hands 
without gloves and a lit cigar in his mouth.
It's closing, Grand Central Station. And I think I see my Uncle Wil, only one month dead, sitting with the homeless, eating a sandwich out of a brown paper bag, and wearing the coat he entrusted me with last Christmas. He asked that I deliver it to the vagrant who lived on my block. I think, though, the guy sold my uncle's Hagar for liquor because within a week it was gone. 

Grand Central is bigger than usual, as big, in fact, as a Midwestern field. An angel- nurse pulls a train of empty ambulance stretchers like a child pulls a chain of wagons looking to give rides to her friends, or like circus elephants link by tails and trunks. Some of the homeless follow her, wanting to get on and lie down. 

As I get closer, this isn't my uncle after all, beyond the information booth, the big clock. The man whose back leans against the blue hazy light of Chemical Bank is someone else. He is screaming, although his words are faint by the time they reach me: "We are all homeless on Earth. This is not where we should be...." 

Outstretched hands like llamas' heads pushing through zoo bars, and voices chanting, "Quarter, quarter, please spare a quarter..." The saxophone, so romantic in New York, turns to a harp that I suspect I am hearing from the roof of heaven, and I swoon to the floor like I did on Fourteenth Street in Our Lady of Guadalupe Church. It was the AIDS mass, and a priest touched my forhead--though I kept saying, 'No-no-no-I won't fall," I eased back onto the floor, was lowered into a grave which became a womb, and came back within seconds to sn-dling faces telling me I'd been very receptive. 

This time when I awake crumpled Zaro's bags and cigarette butts, littered around my face and arms, slowly disappear. And above the glorious Grand Central ceiling, all quarks and quasars and gods with arrows. Without moving, I'm all energy like I'm idling in a car with its hood down or being strapped into a rocket. Then I'm off, pushed and pulled headfirst like a birth, past the windows, the ceiling, toward the light where my uncle is waiting -- where nothing looks particularly familiar yet is, like the hospital I can't remember, but in which I was born.
We must have clamored for the same mother, hurried for the same womb. 
I know it now as I read that my birthday is his. 
Since the first time I saw his picture, I sensed something -- 
and with a fierce bonding and animosity 
began following his career. 

Look where I am and look where he is! 
There is a book documenting his every haircut 
while all my image building attempts go unnoticed, even by my friends. 
I'm too wimpy to just dye my curls red 
or get them straightened. I, sickening and moral, 

talked about chemicals when I should have been 
hanging out with George's pal, Marilyn. 
He would have set me right:
Stop your whining and put on this feather tuxedo. Look, 
do you want to be famous or not? 

In the latest articles, Boy George is claiming he's not 
really happy. Hmm, I think, just like me. 
When he comes to New York and stays at hotels in Gramercy Park 
maybe he feels a pull to the Lower East Side, 
wanders towards places where I am, but not knowing me, doesn't know why. 

One interviewer asks if he wishes he were a woman. 
Aha! I read on with passion: and a poet? Boy, I bet you'd like that -- 
You wouldn't have to sing anymore, do those tiring tours. 
George, we could switch. You could come live at my place, 
have some privacy, regain your sense of self. 

So I begin my letter. Dear Boy George, 
Do you ever sit and wonder what's gone wrong? 
If there's been some initial mistake? 
Well, don't be alarmed. There has been, 
but I can set it straight.
Today, you say, as though an actor 
in some bad coming attraction, 
that you did not leave me for a man, but for all men, 
and I grab a loose hand, Max's leather mitten, 
shake it something like: nice to have met you. 
He is all outside, your new boyfriend. 
His cheekbones as perfect as a summer playground, he's steel 
rings and slides. My face is lost in a muddy flush. 
You've made me hate that I am intricate, all insides, 
a pink watery cave, an occasional gluey pearl. 

We were just driving age when I picked you up 
for a matinee. Both sticky and cool, you showed 
me your unmade bed that summer afternoon 
and winked. Your mother on an errand, 
you closed the door and opened your clothes, 
the green plaid shirt from your newly showered skin. 
You helped me with my belt. 
We arched our waists in some strange ballet. 
Harder than we thought, it was hot and cold 
and slippery all at once. Calf-straining, like ice-skating. 

We heard a slam as you entered. I jerked 
my feet into my jeans, pulled them up 
past my knees, before I spotted my underwear 
wound, a figure eight, on the floor. I coiled the cotton 
into a ball, a twisted lump in my back pocket. Stay here, your palms 
told my shoulders, weighting me down with Winning The Oscar: 
Pictorial Glances in my lap. My lips pouty as stars 
and all swollen red. Your mother yelled: 
I want her out of here! I was just -- your voice as though prying 
two stuck pages apart -- showing her my book. 

I can name every movie we saw for the next five years 
but that one on that day. You quiet, except for: 
I can't believe you let me do that...Maybe my mother is right.
You broke our pact the way we broke each other: 
driving faster, I swerved a cry. You shrugged: 
Don't be sentimental...Besides, men are different. 
Were you looking, even then, for your own shoulder? So many 
shirtless boys on the street. I'd be alone 
and in the cinema restroom with my first-time blood -- 
it streaked my hand, admittance, the color of my ticket stub.
My friend has cervical cancer 
that grew from a wart virus she contracted 
from an ex-lover. There was infidelity 
and lying, the worst relationship she's ever had. 
And now surgery. Possible sterility. 
Her cells keep growing like they don't know any better, 
and her gynecologist is calling back all the wart virus patients 
she's ever treated to test them again, 
this time for the kind 
of cancer my friend has -- a rare, dangerous strain. 
We agreed earlier today -- it's like science fiction. 
I am tired, alive on the subway, 
and Ryan White's on the cover 
of the People magazine I just bought. 
It is dated in advance -- April 23rd -- 
like the eagerness of a virus itself. 
Today, one of my students mentioned, in passing, 
asbestos takes 24 hours to leak 
from a ceiling onto a floor and fully contaminate the air. 
And it seems too soon to put Ryan White in a poem, 
concurrent with all the newspapers and tabloids. 
On a television talk show, one child in a studio audience 
asked Ryan if it was fun to meet celebrities like Elton John 
and Michael Jackson. Adult America realized the question, 
once it had been posed, was exactly the one we'd all been wanting 
to ask. The AIDS-infected boy answered gracefully, 
with an understanding laugh. How easy it is to love 
blond Ryan White, his white straight teeth, 
the white down on his delicate teenage neck, 
the kind of boy I know I'd have had a crush on in high school. 
There is a homeless man right in front of me 
begging for chemotherapy money. I've seen him before 
on the One Line. He blames Agent Orange 
for the knob on his stomach. He pulls up his tee shirt 
to show us -- those who will look -- 
and I fixate on his glob of cancer rather than meet his stare.
He says he'll get off with any of us at any stop, 
sleep on any one of our floors. 
He'll eat anything we don't want in our refrigerators. 
His story includes his two teenage daughters, 
something about the pipelines in Alaska. 
He is furious, like all of us, at the government. 
A fist rises up in his otherwise empty stomach. 
He has not learned the art of forgiveness, 
as Ryan White had, only because he hasn't 
as yet found a sympathetic ear. 
Two days from now my friend will have a part of her cervix removed. 
Two days ago I sent off what I owed to the IRS, 
writing "No bombs. We need AIDS research!" on the memo line 
in the bottom left hand corner 
of my check, but debating first for some time. 
I didn't want to draw any attention to myself. 
I didn't want to be audited. So I turn 
from the Agent Orange man 
and from People's Ryan White story 
to the Poetry Flash magazine I am carrying. 
I see Robert Hass' "A Story About the Body," 
a poem I'd heard him recite at a reading last year, 
the one about the composer who's attracted to a painter, 
but who cannot make love to her 
because she has had a double mastectomy. 
She cannot say her anger, but instead leaves for him 
a bowl of dead bees. 
I burst into tears seemingly not related to me 
as though my eyes were breasts 
I could lose at any time. My eyelids, supple 
as the condom I never thought would break. 
                                                                   "It's nothing, 
really -- it's been coming on for a while," 
I tell the woman sitting next to me 
who offers a Kleenex, probably because I am almost as white 
as Ryan White is white 
and well-dressed, just coming from work. 
When I first heard Robert Hass read 
"A Story About the Body," I thought the man in the poem 
was an unfeeling asshole. But today 
I want to give that composer a hug, 
then lead him to the gorgeousness of the artist's breastless chest. 
I conjure her face, the pallets of her ribs. 
I tell them they could have a meaningful relationship. 
Because they seem like nice people, I explain to them 
what I've learned from my self help books: 
If they don't work out their problems with each other now, 
they'll just have to work them out 
down the line with someone else. 
The Agent Orange man tries another car 
and I am left with these tears, these embarrassing tears 
that taste embarrassingly like sex. 
That taste: don't just sit there, do something. 
That taste like beautiful pollution.
As a child visiting Hampton Beach, 
I was one day so chilled by the ocean 
that when I went to the bath house to pee, 
the warm, by comparison, temperature of my urine 
burned me. I swore I saw a chimney line of smoke 
rise between my legs from the toilet. My mother 
didn't know enough about chemistry to explain it. 
Instead, she insisted on her rules. 
This is the first thing I think of as an adult 
learning that there is a river in Yugoslavia 
so polluted it cannot even be used 
to cool down machinery. As a child taught 
to bless the lakes and brooks and tide pools, 
I didn't cheat until adolescence -- 
relieving myself in Social Pond, my water 
a hot pocket I swam away from fast. 
This local spot was a place for floating ghostly 
arm and leg casts, cigarette butts, an occasional diaper. 
Any one of these could have given me 
my first eye infection, and my mother barred me 
from our local pond completely. I went to my room 
where I thought about the fact that somewhere a fish 
choked on the Band-Aid loosened from the blister on my heel. 
Litterbug was the in word then. Neither my mother nor I 
could have defined carcinogenic or toxin. 
The world went on with us, damning its own baptism 
and cultivating tempting orchards 
of mutant delicious ultraviolet apples.
The time I was ten and walking 
to my friend Donna's house, 
and the German shepherd came out of nowhere. 
His paws on my shoulders 
as though he was bracing me for something, 
about to teach me a lesson 
or new dance. He was like the four foot tall 
rag doll with stirrups on her hands 
and feet that Uncle Ray and Aunt Shirley 
had given me for Christmas. I'd strapped her on 
to learn how to waltz. I could lead her 
or dip her, flop her cotton head 
on my shoulder, but this German shepherd 
was all will and might and silvery gray gums. 
The sky above, a sky of gray sweatshirts 
of lifting barbells or running around tracks. 
The dog leaned into me and I was on the ground. 
He bit in four places, my two shoulders, 
my right hip, my left arm, 
until a man with a hard hat as orange 
as any construction, as orange as a pumpkin, 
came out and whacked the dog on its back. 
"You're trespassing," he said, 
no kinder to me. "You're supposed to go 
by the street." Behind him the sky 
loomed like a trainer, the meanest gym teacher. 
The man yanked me up by one arm, 
and I started to run to Donna's 
knowing from another little girl's scary story, 
men can be even fiercer than dogs. 
"You OK, kid?" he called after me, 
like a bad friend who all of a sudden 
wants to make up, if only because he's afraid 
you'll tell his mom. I ran 
all the way, as though I was on fire 
and didn't know enough to roll in the dirt.
Donna screamed when she opened the door 
to her house, the back of my tee shirt 
all covered with blood, all of it. 
Her mother wasn't home. And so I'd believe her, 
she made me look in the bathroom mirror. 
I called my house and left 
red finger prints on her phone. 
Not until then, did specific places 
on my body start to hurt. 
The pinking sheared notches 
on my shoulders, the ripped open bum 
in my hip. Donna wrapped a facecloth 
around my elbow, near the only wound 
that was exposed. Blood had dripped down 
my leg, around my sneaker, 
and underneath, into the grips on the soles, 
so that each of my footprints also 
left little squiggles of blood 
on the tiles of her bathroom and kitchen floors. 
"I was trespassing," 
I confessed as soon as my mother 
pulled up in the yellow Impala 
and finally I was able to cry. 
She said, "Here, lie down," 
and from the window 
of the back seat, the sky 
a big gray brick, as hard 
as the sky ever gets with no storm 
in sight. I asked how much 
blood I could lose, and my mother 
said, "Don't worry, honey, it looks worse 
than it really is," and I pictured 
the seven pints everyone had, 
but outside of us all, and filling 
the nickel waxy milk cartons 
the lunch ladies sold at school. 
I comforted myself -- how juice in a glass 
always looks like so much more 
after it's been spilled.
In the emergency room, 
the doctor peeled my shirt 
from me like a wet bathing suit, 
told jokes about firemen and rabbits. 
My mother was there, too, 
a strong silent angel. And no one 
said anything like I was wrong 
to be on the path we kids cleared 
through the woods, that ran 
from my street to Donna's, 
long before all the new development 
had started. There was a path, too, 
behind Madeline Avenue 
that went clear through 
to East Woonsocket School. 
Safer for their children 
to walk there, parents thought, 
than on the big busy streets 
that didn't have sidewalks. 
Now, having the time to react, 
my body said what it could 
to the German shepherd. 
From the crook inside my elbow 
emerged a purplish blue ghost, 
like the hickey bruise 
on Donna's older sister's neck, 
soft and full of status, 
hurting less she said 
than getting pierced ears. 
She showed us how it changed 
to a yellowish green 
when, a few weeks later, 
she scrunched down the ribbed collar 
of her turtleneck 
and told us once again, 
"Remember -- this is our secret." 
I had to have a tetanus shot 
so I wouldn't go crazy 
and foam at the mouth, or twirl
the way I'd seen a boy at school 
imitate his dog who'd died from rabies. 
Breaking all the fourth grade rules 
about opposite sex friends, 
this boy sent me a book to read 
while I was recovering. 
My scars were pink shiny maggots, 
even that boy admired, that said 
I could survive anything, 
that said I could go 
wherever I wanted.
In 1981 I was on a train in Milan 
where a man would later try to molest me, 
where later I'd push him so hard 
he'd call me a bitch, though he said nothing else 
in English, and he'd rip the collar 
of my shirt, and I'd kick him and run 
only to be trapped on the platform 
where I could see him masturbating 
through the window of the train he stayed on. 
His friends would block the entrance 
to the terminal where I wanted to get help. 
His friends would call me "bonita," surround me, 
and touch my neck and hair before the police 
would come and do nothing because, they said, 
it wasn't a violation, really. I was all right. 

In 1981 I was on a train in Milan 
trying to write my sister a letter 
because she is a year younger than I am 
and because she was living at home with my parents 
and she was pregnant. I thought, then I wrote, 
"You could get an abortion." But she was eighteen, 
and she was in love with her boyfriend. 
She wanted to get married and have a husband. 
So I scratched out the abortion sentence 
while a man sitting next to me was reading the letter 
that panged on my lap. I was crying when he whispered 
he was able to read English and smiled as though his hand 
was already on my knee. He was like the man 
who would, in a few hours, try to rape me. He asked 
if it was true, if American girls were easy.
First, I'm assuming that gravity is working. 
That you're, at this moment, being pulled 
towards the earth. That your head is bigger 
than your hand. That you know what a computer is. 
That your arms are shorter than your legs. 
That you get around. I assume 
that the land and water masses on the globe 
are proportional representations of the land and water 
masses on earth. I assume the stars 
are where the astronomers tell us they are, 
that such scientists have no reason to lie, 
that there's life on other planets, and the infinity sign 
is symbolized by that little figure eight 
lying on its side. I assume you know how to count and add, 
that you've never gotten to the biggest number. 
That your telephone is currently in service. 
That you have a phone and a pad to take messages. 
That you know your number by heart. 
That you have a few good friends to talk to. 
That they know your phone number and call you often. 
That you think killing someone violently, 
for no good reason, is wrong. That you get hungry. 
That you eat vegetables sometimes. 
That you buy produce in stores, that you wash 
the leaves of lettuce first. That you are troubled, 
at least a little, about our environment. 
That you have a sexual orientation. 
That you can draw a fish or flower. 
That you've never meant 
to deliberately hurt anyone. That you define yourself 
as boy or girl, man or woman. That you are a product 
of your upbringing. That you're more than 
the sum of your parts. That you 
have been stereotyped at some point. 
That you have a legitimate gripe 
That you know more than you let on. 
That you can't always express what you feel. 
That a diamond costs more than a rhinestone. 
That, no matter how rich or poor, you have a price range. 
That you usually get the right change. 
That you have used a stove. 
That you think some behaviors are more acceptable 
than others. That you live by a code of ethics. 
That when you break your own code, you feel bad. 
That you think you're different. 
That you are indeed different. 
That paint brushes are made in an assortment of sizes. 
That you were once smaller than you are now. 
That you are alive. 
That you have celebrated holidays. 
That you have the same birthday as someone else. 
That you think about sex. 
That you have a mother. 
That your father is either dead or alive. 
That you have met your parents or not. 
That there are technicalities. 
That you fantasize about the lives of strangers. 
That you didn't always have those shoes. 
That when your baby teeth were growing in you screamed. 
That you aren't always paying attention. 
That there are certain things you can't remember. 
That you can imagine petting a small animal. 
That you have thought about what love means. 
That sometimes your tongue gets dry. 
That you've felt inadequate. 
That you are sometimes hot, sometimes cold. 
That you've reached out for help. 
That you can do two things at once. 
That your blood is red and you can wink. 
That you are using Marilyn Monroe 
as a reference point for beauty. 
That you have an ego. 
That you worry. That you go to the bathroom. 
That there's a toilet where you live. 
That you live under a roof. 
That you are sometimes ultra-aware one day you will die. 
That you have seen children. 
That you have seen a coat and skirt made of ultra-suede. 
That you know the difference between a spoon and a fork. 
That you sometimes are at a loss for words. 
That you have an opinion. 
That you know how to read or that someone 
will read this to you aloud. Assuming 
I could be wrong, I'm also assuming 
that you understand English. 
That you weren't able to read this before it was written. 
That you are partially made up of bones and plasma. 
That someone else hasn't already written these letters 
in the same exact order with the same exact spaces 
in between. That your body has been immersed in water. 
That you see the same color and shape as I do 
when we look at the same peach. That there is a theater 
near you. That a movie will be released 
at Christmas. That you have been to visit a dentist. 
That if someone says "profit" or "prophet" 
in a conversation you know from the context 
if he or she means "accumulation" or "wise one." 
That you have seen the inside of a church. 
That you've bought someone a present. That you think 
I'll leave something out. That you can grow hair, 
that you sometimes clean your fingernails, 
that your fingernails have gotten harder 
as you've grown older, assuming you've grown older, 
and that, when you were a baby, a caretaker 
peeled your soft cartilage away so that you wouldn't 
accidently scratch yourself. That both your fingernails 
and hair will grow on after you die, 
that you will indeed pass away, 
that you will be buried or cremated, 
that your body will be found, 
that someone will cry when you die, 
that you've cried when someone you've loved has died, 
that you have loved someone -- 
either sexually or as family 
and that those two lines didn't cross, 
or they did. That you want to talk about it. 
That you fret if people say they don't like you. 
That you've been to a party. 
That you like some kind of music. 
That you have felt jealous. 
That the world is round 
because Columbus said so. That you have been to 
or seen pictures of America. 
That you have been exposed to ritual. 
That you have rejected certain traditions. 
That you like some people more than others. 
That you have been angry. 
That you have been oppressed. 
That if a stranger saw your naked body 
you'd feel something like shame or surprise. 
That you know what a gun can do. 
That you have watched tv in color or black and white. 
That you identify your skin with a shade 
that doesn't accurately specify 
the richness of its tones. 
That you have put check marks in boxes. 
That you've observed someone with chapped lips. 
That you have suffered. 
That you have relatives and a background. 
That you have said something you didn't mean. 
That you have a preference. 
That you're only human. 
That you have made a mistake when writing 
and had to cross whole words out. I assume 
that the operator will help you 
place your call. That the post office 
will be opened as scheduled this week. 
That you have a goal. That there's a want 
in your belly and a heart in your chest. 
That you'll look up any words you don't understand. 
That you've had misunderstandings. 
That you believe some things can be mended. 
That you have a dictionary and enough light. 
That the pages in your dictionary are arranged 
in consecutive order, that your definitions 
are close to the same as mine.
The fireflies might have been bouncing balls in a sing-along. 
You could have followed their luminous bellies, recited 
the right lyrics, and lied so easily. It was night. 
I wouldn't have believed you anyway, honest -- 
because of the raspberry liquor and the swaying candles. 
It wasn't even your boat in which we were going to make love. 
And I kept wondering if the flies, too, were for hire, 
like passionate fireworks so far away from the shore. 
It was a lie, a skit from Love American Style, 
except you didn't love me at all 

the night before Father's Day. I wasn't really young enough 
to be your daughter, but it was close. You kidded 
that you wanted a present because you had had four abortions, 
four trips to the clinic with three different women. 
I started to cry because of everything, 
but mostly because you'd forgotten my birthday. 
You said as though I had no right to my tears, 
"Look, I never thought about you in that way at all. 
You were just fun to have sex with. 
You're a spunky girl, but honestly, you're not even my type." 

It was like Christmas in an awful house 
with no presents, just a blaring tv, and no one even trying 
to sing a carol or make a turkey. 
A voice in my head said, "You can fix this. You can fix this." 
But was it my house or yours? It was a whole different 
time, in a different part of the country. 
A stronger voice in my head, 
one that I usually only hear witnessing accidents 
or getting a phone call about death, 
said, "Get out. Get out for your life." 

I looked through the porthole. Could I swim to shore? 
What was lurking in the bay water? The dinghy, 
like a diaphragm, elaborately tied up in knots, would take too long.
"I'm an old man, and I still look at each woman 
I pass on the street. I wonder if she's wearing a bra 
or the color of her pubic hair -- I can't help it." 
I was the child whose mind, in part, is off, far away. 
Another part was stuck listening to a ranting parent. 
You were unbuttoning your shirt like it was a turn-on, 
regardless of me, regardless that I was planning my escape.
Well, maybe that explains everything. 
In your house in Key West, where the pastels of the town 
must have driven you crazy, above the fireplace mantle -- 
like an expose -- you're pictured in frills as a toddler. 
"Knickers were fashionable for boys," 
the tour guide explains, "But Hemingway's mother, well..."
Her perky voice trails off as though, after all these tourists, 
she still hasn't found the right words. 

But there you are again, all grown up and in plaid flannel, 
against the far wall. "You'll notice," the tour guide says now, 
her monologue-pace restored, "Our Hemingway was quite a sportsman." 
You stand with an enormous fish, cranked so that its nose 
is to the ground in defeat -- its tail is hoisted straight up, 
making the fish double your height. 
And in another photo, you hold a pair of antlers, 
proud and with no apology, as though they were a bowling trophy. 

Deer heads and moose heads are mounted in your study to extinguish 
any lingering doubt. You typed with two fingers and married 
four times, each wife dismissed when she showed too much independence. 
Liquor-locks, around the vodka insured no one would drink 
unless you were home. But bored with you always gone, Pauline, 
Mrs. Hemingway-number-three, put in a pool and raised 
the kitchen counter six inches so you'd have no excuses -- from now on 
you could clean your own fish without straining your back. 

Hemingway, we know you loved cats, but you even machoed that, 
bringing home a urinal from Sloppy Joe's 
to make into a drinking trough for your pets who'd leave a line, 
a geometric progression of offspring. Mutant cats, 
every generation with more toes than the last, each extra 
jutting from a front paw like a little potent penis. 
Maybe you were rough, wrestling the kittens and throwing them 
into the pool, then toweling them dry, saying things like "Ah shucks."

And it's true, mothers so often get blamed for it all -- but a dress? 
Some whisper also that your father was henpecked. 
Freud was forty-nine when you wore a skirt for the last time, 
and he would have forgiven you, freely, the way we do -- the way 
you forgave your mother when you dragged your three-legged labor chair 
to a bullfight, and sat in it to watch the gore. Did you think 
of your mother as you sat, as though daring someone to make fun, 
in an antique chair in which antique women actually gave birth?
I know you won't mind if I ask you to put this on. 
It's for your protection as well as mine -- Wait. 
Wait. Here, before we rush into anything 
I've bought a condom for each one of your fingers. And here -- 
just a minute -- Open up. 
I'll help you put this one on, over your tongue. 
I was thinking: 
If we leave these two rolled, you can wear them 
as patches over your eyes. Partners have been known to cry, 
shed tears, bodily fluids, at all this trust, at even the thought 
of this closeness.
I run into my old boyfriend's new boyfriend 
on Boylston Street and, as he talks, I fish around 
in my handbag, my pockets, for something sharp 
so I can stab him. He prattles insensitive circles: 
how my old boyfriend is impossible, but I already know that. 
I want to call him queer boy, a faggot: he keeps calling me "hun," 
twirling the fringe on my scarf. We have nothing in common 
until his goodbye: pink gums show between his teeth 
and upper lip. He has my goofy kind of smile, 
the kind my old boyfriend always made fun of. 
Boy, is this guy in for trouble.
My dentist was Doctor Alexander. 
I chose him because he was within walking distance. 
There was no indication in the phone book 
that he was into S&M. I might have been 
into it too, if I could have played S, 
but stuck as an M in his chair as he patted the top of my head, 
I felt queasy when he seductively said 
he'd checked me out 
long enough to find a cavity 
because he likes all the young pretty ones to come back 
before their customary six months. 
I brushed him off, anesthetized to the routine 
of hooting and whistling 
women encounter everyday 
on twentieth century New York City streets, the sleazy smiles 
and hands pawing ours 
when we get change with our newspapers. 
So I kept my next dentist engagement, dreading it 
only slightly more than a usual visit. 
This time Doctor Alexander wanted to give me a crown -- 
a $650 expenditure if I'd go away with him 
for a weekend. We could get to know each other first, 
he reasoned, as the procedure takes four or five visits. 
But all that gold wouldn't have shown, 
wouldn't have taken me any closer to royalty. 
My dentist retaliated to my polite rejection -- 
pinched me with a Novocaine needle, 
then drilled way too deep, hitting a nerve. 
His square dental light loomed like the flash of white 
before the start of a horror movie -- one I, at that moment, 
decided to write the script for -- warrior women 
with teeth in their vaginas to curtail their rapists. 
Doctor Alexander asked me a question about what I did 
for a living, pretending I'd be able to answer 
though both his hands worked in my mouth. 
Then he volunteered he'd become a dentist
because the pay is terrific and there are no emergencies 
in the middle of the night. Once, in a childhood fight, 
my sister bit my arm as hard as she could, 
her upper and lower biting partners 
trying to connect, to rip through my flesh. 
The imprints she left 
were like horse shoes, battle scars of good luck, 
that bruised into purple, pale blue, then faint green. 
Doctor Alexander had no way of knowing that this was the memory 
he was inspiring in me, but I knew he could see, 
on the occlusal surfaces of each of my teeth, 
little imprints and shadows like characters 
of a language neither of us could understand. 
They spelled out my learned and archetypical rage 
at every situation this reminded me of. 
The dentist's metal explorer and drill bits 
righteously displayed on his instrument tray, 
his towel clip civilly clutching the paper bib under my chin. 
He could lower or elevate me at his will 
with the lift pedal at his feet. Human teeth 
last longer than bones which is why 
some have looked to them, instead of the stars, 
for answers. Crowded-toothed persons 
never straying from home, pointy-toothed others 
unworthy of trust, and those unfortunates 
with spaces between their two front teeth 
never to be happily married. Babies 
born with nubs of enamel 
poking through their gums, the wisest of all. 
Doctor Alexander's handpiece hissed, then stopped 
for the last time in my presence. 
As he silently stirred the silver paste 
with which he'd fill his mistake -- 
a sparkling inlay in my upper second molar -- 
I pictured the future of women, 
what part of them would live on 
long after their flesh and skeletons -- 
their lips no longer there to purse or frown, their fists 
and legs no longer there to clench and kick -- 
only their smiles left to grin and bear it.
It has something to do with sex, I've read. 
Teeth hanging by gum threads. I twist and swing 
them, cradle-like, with my tongue, a thick wind 
rocking tree-bound babes, while keeping them embedded. 
And what if they're grown-up? It's cold and hard 
as a coffin, this stretcher. Wind-up choppers 
clatter among scalpels, circular mirrors, 
liplessly wording, Your smile won't grow back.
What has been under pillows? Teeth, a gasp -- 
piggy bank quarters or nickels closing eyes. 
And the gynecologist won't hear my heart 
as he fits me for dentures, so I start 
to sprout, all molars, bicuspids, canines 
and incisors from my antarctic mouth.

Since AIDS, a rape is worse than rape, 
we were just saying that the other day. 
Then it happened. Worse than we could have expected. 
You were sleeping in your loft bed 
six feet from the floor, and nowhere to go, 
when you woke to his knees on your shoulders, 
his hand on your face, and a knife at your throat. 
Such awful aftershave, you choked 
and wiggled just enough to free your mouth 
from his palm, to take an occasional breath. 
He could have crushed you, broken your neck 
with one arm behind his back. He said that. 
He said he was showing you mercy. 
He said it was the first time 
he'd done anything like this, 
like you were so special. And there was a mask 
on his face for the occasion, 
and you woke to him there with you in your bed, 
darker than your worst childhood fears. 
Darker than dreams of ovens and coffins, 
you wait for your period, 
pray you are HIV negative, 
and will wait again for a test in another six months. 
America is a place where all privacy is gone, 
we were just saying that the other day. 
We were saying maybe it's because one day soon 
there will be no room for any of us 
to have as much as a lawn. But we were just talking, 
we didn't really expect it -- 
this man who raped you, who snuck 
through a back window, and then left 
through a front door.
I'm jealous when my mother touches anything else. 
The potatoes that roll in the stainless steel sink. 
The water runs and my mother rubs each bump -- 
under their chins, behind their necks -- clean. 
Sometimes she bathes me here, washes my hair 
kneading small circles on my scalp. I trust her, 
"Keep your eyes closed. Cover your ears." 
Now there's a flame, small and round as a hand mirror 
taunting from under the pot on the stove, 
"Who is the fairest child of all?" 
And I stand on a chair to watch water bubbles pop a soft "Oh no," 
then disappear. My mother gently plunks potatoes in, one by one, 
and says, "Careful not to tip. These will be done 
when the skins crack, when I can stick a fork in." 

There was a mother in the newspaper this week 
who cooked her baby and served it to her husband 
as though it were a chicken.
If Daniel Rakowitz had only dreamt 
about eating Monika Beerle's flesh, 
these dreams possibly could have expressed 
his desire to live off her money 
or perhaps his devouring passion -- 
with an element of oral sadism. 
Or even a regression on his part, 
an attempt to psychically reincorporate with his mother -- 
reverse the process of his being disgorged 
from her during delivery, 
as if the opposite of birth 
wasn't really death at all. 

But it wasn't a dream: 
Monika's head boiling in her own pot, on her own stove. 
Daniel seasoning, then eating, her brains and her heart. 
Some say he thought in this Satanic-cult-way 
that he would finally be able to control her. 
But could it be, instead, that she's wound up 
controlling him? Maybe now, in prison, Daniel dances 
the way Monika had at Martha Graham. 
Maybe he will suddenly share her love for everybody, 
including Jews and Gays and Rastafarians. 
Maybe he will develop a taste 
for things Swiss. Yes, maybe now, in prison,

Daniel will become Christian, 
having had Monika as his communion. 
So transformed, he will apologize to the cops 
for ever having called any of them pigs, and 
because of his sincerity, the courts will set him free 
so he can play himself 
in the made-for-tv movie. Then, with the money he makes, 
maybe he'll begin his own ministry. He'll return 
to feeding the homeless in Tompkins Square Park, 
but with more of Monika's gracefulness, a lighter step. 
Maybe Daniel will teach us, through his transformation 
and repentance, no one can ever truly destroy a spirit.
Jung says the soul is round. 
And so is a bird bath. Round? 
So are the bracelet slots of handcuffs and mounds 
rising on a pair of brass knuckles. 
Jung says the soul is round. 
And I see its reflection everywhere 
in one of the poorest parks in America. 
What I want to say first is there are no flowers, 
but then joy takes over because there is the sun and an orange 
a gray man is gratefully holding. 
And the round pockmarks on the orange. 
Summers before, there have been riots, 
but today in the park, a library book 
rests in a child's lap. His wooly head peers 
at a picture of a round pie before it's been cut. 
The fork marks around its perimeter 
as mysterious as designs on a mandala. 
A hoola hoop flies askew on a young girl's hips, 
a ring around her rhythm of Saturn. 
The tiny unseen beads swishing music in her striped loop. 
The parabloid trash receptacles. 
And that round sun again that doesn't let up. 
The spidery umbrella, no longer any good against the rain -- 
a floppy parasol, doing what it can, 
over the fair round and round-freckled redhead.
Please, just give me a map, and I'll follow it. 
And, if I'm worthy, throw in a sign -- 
maybe a miracle to show me I'm on the right track 

or a coincidence, a deja vu so strong 
I'll say, "Aha! This is the way to heaven." 
Dear Mother, Father, Brother, Sister, or Genderless-One, 

I live among your humblest achievers. It was easy 
for me to get A's in school because I was told 
what to study, and I did it. My meals 

always look exactly as they do in the pictures 
of the cook book. I'm not a deviant. I'm only here 
to serve you, whoever you are, but like 

an overwhelmed waitress, I'm not sure 
you're in my section of tables. I run around 
in Zen circles, climb the highest totem pole -- I love all 

the directions of the cross: West, North, East, and South. 
I love the twelve apostles and the zodiac. The numbers, 
the colors, the letters of a name all mean something to me. 

The lines on my palm, the configuration of my tea leaves. 
The tarot, the runes, the pennies, and the I Ching. 
But like a sorceress pleasing too many masters 

and mistresses, too many shepherds at once, 
I am a sheep and, as you know, a consumer -- therefore I need to 
be told what to buy. And you must understand this -- 

even paintings of baby Jesus change through the ages: 
sometimes he's fat, black or white, sometimes lean. 
So Goddesses and Gods, I plead again for direction. If only 

you could put me on a special mailing list -- or send me 
an advertisement like the ones that only go out 
to preferred shoppers announcing a special sale in advance. 

Show me the way, and I'll go. In the meantime, you'll find me 
down by the river, getting close to what is left 
of nature. I'll wrap my arms around me mummy-style and roll 

down the biggest hill -- sky, grass, sky, grass, sky, grass -- 
and wait for your reply. I'm ready for anything. Maybe 
you'll be little green men and women. Maybe 

you'll charge out of the doors of your flying saucers 
on horseback. Maybe you'll plant kisses 
on all of us, on each Earth-bound Beauty's sleeping cheek.
You said that if we could just touch 
we'd be able to figure it out. 
Your palm scanned me up and down 
like we were two parts of the same computer -- 
screen and mouse, bytes and search keys, 
orphans and widows, open windows. 
Your hand finally found what she wanted: 
the pea under my mattress. We referenced 
my clitoris, then cross-filed it 
with beauty, ocean, politics, the deep. 
We grew small in each others arms 
the way lovers can in their dreams. 
Then I exclaimed the pea was a pearl. 
Each ring shadowed a halo. Lifejackets bloomed 
the colors of tropical fruits. 
Knowing no ending was completely happy, 
we slipped through mighty thorns, 
sliding safely through technology 
until there was enough room for us 
to be home wherever we went.
The sky sings in plurals. 
Sun, moon. Moon, earth. Star, wish, and us. 
At night we wake to these songs 
which circle like whole notes, whole rings 
around the earth, around Saturn, and Venus. 
Mars, we hear this singing, half cold 
and half light. Beyond buildings, beyond traffic, 
sometimes beyond text books or maps, all eyes raise 
seemingly at once. EGBDF: 
Every Good Boy Does Fine. This was the way we learned 
what sounds rested on what lines of our music books. 
Our ears, bass clefs, trembling cliffs 
with small oceans inside, keep our balance 
and ping with this cadence. Like spoons 
tapping on glasses of water, on glasses of wine, 
the stars sing in the sky. So even when we pull away 
like receding waves to look at our sorrow, to look 
without love at each other, we are struck by the curve 
of these sounds which pull us, rising, always 
reaping, always towards joy.
When Cindy Shaw told me 
her mother wrote The Happy Hooker
I believed her. On our way to Scarborough 
Beach, we read passages aloud 
from the creased paperback. 
All three of us in the front seat 
of the powder blue Cadillac 
convertible. Mrs. Shaw's pink kerchief 
flapping like a cheerleader's skirt, 
her platinum waves stuck in place. 
Lucky, their black labrador, sprawled 
on the back seat, barking 
sometimes when we laughed. 

Mrs. Shaw told us everything. 
She would make up our bottom lips 
with her gooey finger 
then point to her breasts 
between the plunge in her bathing suit, 
asking Cindy or me to lean over and check 
if her freckles were turning into sunspots. 
She had stillborn triplets once 
and said she was too old now 
to go through three more births. 
Maybe I was like one of the daughters 
she'd lost. She buried the babies 
giving them names all beginning with "C."

Cindy's magazines spread out 
on the blanket, blazing fingernails 
and hair. We watched Mrs. Shaw giggle 
for lifeguards, pretending to chase Lucky 
in shallow waves, while we tugged 
at our suits all gritty. In the shower 
Mrs. Shaw promised an "R" rated drive-in 
and hooked each one of us for a moment 
into her bra. She pinched at what she called 
"two empty sandpails." Then she made us 
swear not to tell Mr. Shaw any of this. 
His construction working hands seemed 
sometimes as big as car fins.
The blue of Bill's Pet Shop fish tank was all 
I knew to know, so down, down, eyes open 
for pastel gravel, plastic scuba men, 
sausaged air on their backs. My slow fall. 
I was thinking wax bottles, sweet liquid 
inside, the penny-candy case Terry 
kept in her store: Snow White-like I would be 
laid next to gummy fish, magical-dead. 
Then, nothing at once, but a seaweed bruise. 
Grasses of mangers or Easter baskets, 
muddle of holy days. Palm, pine, confused. 
I was just six enough to know regrets. 
My sister kicking, sunlit, above me: 
Sweet Jesus. Her feet, I must kiss her feet.
There were always two of everything (one for each of us) but 
in different colors so we wouldn't get mixed up, and 
one color, we thought, was always definitely better. The one 
both of us, of course, definitely wanted. The same thing 
was true with lunch boxes -- they may have both been 
blue, but with unlike logos. Or 
shoes -- one pair with laces, another with buckles. 
Or two music boxes, but with separate songs. 

With their girls only one year and four days apart, our parents 
didn't have time to learn how to play favorites. Twins, 
some people thought we were. Our Zodiac sign Gemini, we multiplied 
times two our personalities, times two 
what we really felt inside, times two 
because there were two of us. And when we fought, 
someone usually said, "You just want that 
because your sister does, too." 

But some things in two 
were more clearly unequal: the foretelling halves 
of a wishbone; heads or tails meant one of us had to lose; 
or the samara twirling like a green set of wings 
from the maple tree in our yard. When an adult 
snapped one apart and handed each of us a section to open 
and wear on our noses, one side was always blessed 
with more sticky sap. And the less lucky of us 
had to hold the witchy nose-extender on with our fingers. 

And even though we weren't divided that terrible sibling way: 
one pretty, one smart -- one was prettier, one smarter. 
Those comparatives like: one had better boyfriends, 
longer hair, or nicer clothes, any given year. 
Or we were known by events. One played softball, 
one couldn't. One cracked up the car, and one didn't. 
And although sometimes two seemed too much, sometimes 
it wasn't enough. We lost out, for example, on the superlatives: 

Being only two, we couldn't be the best of anything. 
We were more like our scrambling hands in the game we played -- 
opisthenar, palm, opisthenar, palm -- only one of us 
on top for a split second at a time. And as we grew, 
sharing the same room, one of us might have been watching tv 
while doing homework. The other 
talking on the phone while reading a magazine. And 
instinctively, like a conversation in stereo, 

we knew when to pass the com chips. So sometimes, 
when I think my sister's children are mine or 
my sister feels like she's just finished my poem, 
they are and she did, in that moment sometimes... 
because somewhere our mother closes her compact two-sided mirror, and, in a dark 
corner of her purse, the enlarged and lifesize 
reflect each other. And maybe somewhere our father 
tells a joke, how I kept the womb warm for the second one.
"See the way she fumbles for her keys while he keeps talking -- 
that's going to mean something later on." 
You were whispering to me about the movie on the screen 
of the Orson Welles Theater. In your third year of film school, 
you said with authority, "Because film is so expensive, 
                                                                                 nothing 

is shot that isn't connected later..." 
You paused when a character was killed, then continued: 
"Not like in novels. You don't have time to be sloppy 
with description -- will it matter after or not? 
"No, I think every word counts in fiction or poetry, too," 
I lamely said, my major English Lit. 

We didn't have sex, and though you didn't say, 
"That's going to mean something later on," 
it did. The track marks on your arm -- I thought 
they were as tragically romantic as suicide bracelets. 
You had been in a rehab, and I said, 
                                                       "Anyone 

overcoming such obstacles must be an angel." No one we knew then 
knew anything about AIDS. You said, "Let's not spoil our 
friendship," or something like that. And I stayed for the night 
anyway, falling asleep on your bed while you were looking 
through your books to show me something. You moved to Belgium 
that summer, and I never heard from you again. 

Walking home the next day I saw a little boy on the Fenway, 
his mother was whacking him on the back with her purse. 
"Son of a bitch," she said, "when will you learn to listen?" 
That's going to mean something later on -- 
someone is going to pay for this, 
                                                  I thought. 

But as though karma those days was a boomerang 
caught in a whirling wind and coming back off course, 
it was easy for me to feel like a victim. I was sure 
the witness would pay, or perhaps someone on this block 
whose windows were closed, who was cooking supper right then 
for her husband. But maybe if the moon is a projector, 
I reason, and our actions are now what happens on screen, 
then the karma is all right, though not always a karma 
of happy endings. The close-ups might be headlines: 
wars, land fills, national deficits. Or maybe 
our personal triumphs and tragedies. 
                                                          More likely wdre players 

in a thriller -- the audience watching us knows computers 
give us cancer, though the few characters who read about it 
in the New Yorker can't get their editorials published 
anywhere. And the cancer researcher is not-so-mysteriously 
bought out. I pray we are as precious as celluloid, 
and someone watching knows all of this means something.
I kiss a homeless woman on the lips, 
soothe the angry young man passing leaflets 
with a hug and his angry young causes dissolve. 
I tell the Yuppie couple, "I think you're nifty. 
I hope you get every appliance and gadget 
you want." I invite my new DINK neighbors 
(Double Income, No Kids) for dinner 
and a menage a trois. I pet a mangy dog who growls at me 
straining against his owner's leash 
while I hold a baby with a rash as his teenage mother 
folds up a stroller. A hood spits, missing 
the sidewalk, and hits my shoe. So what? 
I pay for a mustard-laced pretzel with a ten 
and tell the vendor, "You keep the change. 
I love everyone today." "You's crazy lady," 
he says, looking afraid. And my feelings 
towards him, well, they don't change.
Oh, Mr. Ferris, what an invention! 
Your diagrams and blueprints, your wild imaginings 
finally turning, slow and high that initial time -- 
the toast of the fair, rising over the rest 
of flat Chicago. I feel like one of the first to ride 
this night of my birthday, a century later 
in another city, another state. The summer 
moon is rosy pink and maybe it's the climbing 
and falling like sex that makes the man 
who stands in front of my lover and I in the long line 
boast he's taken the same girl on this ride 
for twenty-six years in a row. His wife blushes, 
half of her coy, the other half embarrassed 
that her husband's so loud. I will be married 
in a couple of months, and in my mind 
my ring twirls like Mr. Ferris's first initials: 
W. G. W. Letters con-ting back 
to eclipse themselves. Ford Madox Ford. 
William Carlos Williams. The palindrome 
of my birth date and age: 13 and 31. 
My lover and I will kiss, sure 
we are blessed, every time 
we go over the top crest. 
The luck of the circle and the sun.
The manatee tries a diet of only sea grass, but still stays fat. 
Mistaking her for a mermaid from afar, 
sailors of long ago lost interest when they got too close, 
openly making fun of her chubbiness. She knows Rodney Dangerfield 
would write jokes about her if she were more popular. 
She's ashamed of her crooked teeth, her two big molars 
that leave her sucking and grinding 
with bad table manners. She swims towards danger 
over and over, scars from motor boats on her back 
reminders of her slow stupidness. She resents being 
called a sea-cow. She hopes her whiskers don't show 
in the light. She is the mammal who knows 
about low self-esteem. I first met her on my honeymoon 
in southern Florida. I was on a cruise in my one piece bathing suit. 
The women in bikinis squealed and pointed to the nearby dolphins, 
clapping so their sleek gray backs would come to the water's surface. 
In the shadow of her prettier ocean sister, the manatee swam by also. 
No one but I paid her much attention. I wanted to lend her 
my make-up, massage her spine, lend a girlfriend-ear 
and listen to her underwater troubles. I dreamt of her 
as I slept in the warmth of my new husband. I dreamt of her 
as he slept in the warmth of me. On a good day, too, 
I can relate to the manatee, who knows 
on some level that she is endangered 
and believes in mating for life.
No one warned me he'd long for loins and hocks 
so soon into our marriage. My husband munches from bags 
of second-choice pork rinds on the porch, not wanting to exclude me from the dinner 
he really wants to make. Back in college, his roommates loved his pork chops. 
At midnight he and his friends often drove to a diner famous for its spare ribs. 

I catch my husband looking longingly at the pork. 
I'm on my way from the dairy aisle and, not wanting to make it an issue 
then, place the milk and cottage cheese in our cart 
loud enough to give him warning. He obediently slides over to the chicken 
and picks out a four-pack of yellow dimply breasts. 

As a wife who doesn't eat red meat, I feel inadequate. I wiggle my toes in the pink 
slippers he gave me for Christmas. I've read enough to know what happens 
when husbands don't get what they want. Should he romanticize his unabashed 
pork-eating past, he'll start to resent me -- fast. I remember with a shudder 
his sheer pleasure when I passed him my slice of ham at our wedding reception. 

Whenever we're in a restaurant, he orders sides of bacon. I find cans 
of Spam and Bacos behind the breakfast cereal in the cupboard. 
I explain I'm not trying to hold him back, that he should eat pork in the house. 
I'm not self-righteous in my decision to keep boars and sows out of my diet. 
But always polite, my husband swears he doesn't want to. 

What's the fun of eating sausage alone? My girlfriend, who loves pork too, 
makes her point. Of course, I feel worse. Aren't I woman enough to meet 
my husband's needs? Threatened, I confront him about his behavior 
at the pork counter. At first he doesn't recall, then he says he was only looking. 
So now he's only looking. Marriage disasters from my childhood sizzle. 

Uncle Waldo always said, "Hey, it's not a crime to look, is it?" 
when a good-looking "babe" walked by. But Aunt Charlotte knew it was. 
After a few years, she threw all his clothes out of the window, crying it's over, 
calling him a swine. Always loving, my husband hugs and reassures me. 
I look down at my fuzzy slippers and feel better. Uncle Waldo hated pig's feet.
There was the expensive cream from France 
that promised the dimples would vanish 
if applied nightly to the problem spots. 
Then, when that didn't work, Kiko, the masseuse 
at Profile Health Spa, dug her thumbs 
deep into my flesh as she explained 
in quasi-scientific terms that her rough hands 
could break up the toughest globules of cellulite. 
I screamed, then bruised over, but nothing 
else happened. When they healed, my legs still looked 
like tapioca pudding. There was the rolling pin method 
I tried as far back as seventh grade, 
kneading my lumpy legs as though I was making bread. 
Cottage Cheese Knees, Thunder Thighs -- 
I heard it all -- under the guise of teasing, 
under the leaky umbrella mistaken for affection. 
I learned to choose long dresses 
and dark woolen tights, clam diggers instead of short-shorts, 
and, when I could get away with it, skirted bathing suits. 
The nutritionist said that maybe Royal Jelly tablets 
would break up the fat. I drank eight glasses 
of water everyday for a month. I ate nothing 
but steak for a week. I had to take everyone's advice, 
fearing that if I didn't, my thighs 
would truly be all my own fault. Liposuction 
cost too much. The foil sweat-it-out 
shorts advertised in the back of Redbook 
didn't work. Swimming, walking in place, leg lifts. 
It's embarrassing, especially being a feminist. 
I wondered if Andrea Dworkin had stopped worrying, 
and how. If Gloria Steinem does aerobics, 
claiming it's just for her own enjoyment. 
Then I read in a self-help book: 
if you learn to appreciate your thighs, they'll appreciate 
you back. Though it wasn't romance at first sight, 
I did try to thank my legs for carrying me up nine flights 
the day when the elevator at work was out; 
for their quick sprint that propelled me 
through the closing doors of the subway 
so that I wouldn't be late for a movie; 
for supporting my nieces who straddled, one 
on each thigh, their heads burrowing deep into my lap. 
I think, in fact, that it was at that moment 
of being an aunt I forgot for an instant 
about my thigh dilemma and began, more fully, 
as they say, enjoying my life. So when it happened later 
that I fell in love, and as a bonus, 
the man said he liked my thighs, I shouldn't have been 
so thoroughly surprised. At first I was sure I'd misheard -- 
that he liked my eyes, that he had heard someone else sigh, 
or that maybe he was having a craving for french fries. 
And it wasn't very easy to nonchalantly say oh, thanks
after I'd made him repeat. I kept asking 
if he was sure, then waiting for a punch 
line of some mean-spirited thigh-related joke. 
I ran my fingers over his calf, brown and firm, 
with beautiful muscles waving down the back. 
It made no sense the way love makes no sense. 
Then it made all the sense in the world.

NOTES
Back then only Sun Woman had a vagina. 
Only Sun Woman and her brother Moon Man 
had anuses. They traveled, not knowing their privilege 
until they came upon a settlement. Outside the igloos 
were lumps of caribou breasts and rich suet -- 
the villagers had to suck their meat without swallowing 
since there was no way for them to expel it. 
Babies back then were cut from the womb, the mother 
sewn back together with braided caribou sinew. 
Sister Sun and Brother Moon wanted the kind of love 
siblings could not give to each other 
so they looked among the people for companions. 
Moon Man, to consummate his marriage, took a knife 
and gently slit his wife in the crotch. Instead of blood, 
a vulva and vagina appeared. Sister Sun 
was the first in the village to give birth 
by breaking her water and going into labor. 
Her baby was the first of the village to have both genitals 
and an anus. The women of the settlement sang their praises, 
wielding knives between their legs. Then, men 
and women alike seized meat forks 
and stabbed themselves in the rear. 
Those who hit the right places gained anuses 
and the party began. People, like none other before them, 
gobbled down food and gulped up love.
There was a giant who was particularly fond of humans. 
He camped near them, his lice -- white bears and white wolves. 
He drank whole lakes when he grew thirsty 
and generated winds throughout Siberia. He once fell in love 
with an Inuk woman, and since he was already married, 
convinced the woman's husband to swap his wife 
for the giant's. The husband was tempted by the thought 
of enormous green female genitals 
and agreed without asking his wife's opinion. The giant 
picked up the woman in his palm and blew back her hair 
with a sigh. The man swam in the folds of the female giant's vulva 
and she barely knew he was there. He disappeared 
in her vagina and was never seen again. 
Although he tried to be kind, the giant 
split the woman in half. He returned to his giant wife, 
the one he was made for. As they kissed, 
ice floes cracked. The whole ground shook.
Her black hair was as slick as a seal's, her face as round 
as any planet. Her eyes were empty bowls 
after a measly meal, her first young love dead 
at the bottom of the sea. He had drowned while fishing, 
the villagers told her, without the proof of a body. Other suitors 
began to call, but all she could see was the ocean inside them. 
Friends bought her gifts of blubber, the consoling magic of whales 
that was both food and lamp oil, the energy 
of life. The mourning girl carved her love's face 
in the fat that once breathed between the skin and muscle 
of a swimming mammal. Her creation looked so much like him, 
she continued to carve his whole body, miniature details coming back to her 
as though she were still lying in his viable arms. She rubbed 
her soft blubber sculpture against her vulva 
until it grew, first the size of a puppet, then a child. 
The blubber began to rub back, sprouting at incredible speed 
and when the girl came, her dead love was alive again. 
The villagers thought it a miracle. There was a party 
and a wedding the very next day. The young couple 
kept their secret, the blubber lubricant, a special part 
of their sex. When it was time for the boy to go back to work, 
he set out in the very same fishing boat from which he fell 
and drowned. The girl begged him to stay home, 
but the boy convinced her that they were running low on salted mackerel. 
Out in the sun, he felt himself beginning to melt, 
his skin not quite human skin, his heart beating double time. 
He paddled to shore as quickly as he could, then ran. 
He was only half his man-size when he reached the igloo they shared. 
The girl packed her husband in snow, massaging his body, 
watching him grow. As the years went on, she never used the word 
burden, though she grew tired doing all the heavy work herself. 
Blubber boy lost his spunk, his fear of anything warm interfering 
with even their lovemaking. He feared fire, 
sweat, circulation, sparks, the very insulation from which he'd sprung.
He could have had anything he wanted. 
A caribou with special powers had granted him a wish. 
But all he craved were his wife's long nails against his back. 
Every night after the hunt, this is what he'd ask: 
Wife, please scratch me hard.
This wife loved her husband and worried because his back 
was getting so red. 
But his itch was as deep as the middle of the earth. 
When she stopped, he cried and could not fall asleep. 
This wife loved her husband and worried because he 
was starting to bleed. 
But his satisfaction was as far away as the sun. 
He begged her to get the scraper she used on hides and use it on him. 
This wife loved her husband who was now only bones. 
She kept stepping over the pile long after her neighbors buried him.
This couple couldn't figure it out. 
The man licked his wife's genitals while she stared straight ahead. 
The woman poked her husband's testicles with her nose. 
The man put his toe in the folds of the woman's vulva. 
The woman took the man's penis under her armpit. 
Neither one of them wanted to be the first to admit 
something was off. So it went on -- 
the man put his finger in his wife's navel. 
The woman batted her eyelashes against the arch of her husband's foot. 
They pinched each other's earlobes. They bit each other's rear ends. 
To perpetrate the lie, they ended each encounter with a deep sigh. 
Then one day while the husband was hunting, 
a man stopped by the igloo and said to the wife: 
I hear you have been having trouble. 
I can show you how to make love.
He took her to bed and left before the husband came home. 
Then the wife showed her husband, 
careful to make it seem like the idea sprang 
from both. After all these years of rubbing one's face against the other's belly 
or stroking a male elbow behind a female knee, 
this couple had a lot of catching up to do. They couldn't stop to eat or sleep 
and grew so skinny they died. No one found them for a long time. 
And by then, their two skeletons were fused into one.
Everyone knows not to have sex after handling a corpse. 
But Him-Whose-Penis-Stretches-Down-To-His-Knees 
pointed to his groin and said, "This big fellow isn't afraid of taboos." 
His wife warned him, but he just laughed as he rolled her onto her back. 
The next day a huge raven rose up from a boulder 
and grabbed the penis of Him-Whose-Penis-Stretches-Down-To-His-Knees. 
The raven tugged as though the penis were a frozen piece of fish. 
The raven tugged until he tore off most of the penis, then flew away. 
Now people from the village point to the man 
whose urges couldn't wait one more day. 
They taunt him by calling out his new name: Him-Whose-Penis-
Barely-Peeps-From-Its-Cave.
There was a husband who married a wife he found so beautiful 
that his penis was in a state of constant arousal. 
His wife was delicate and needed her sleep, but the needy penis 
kept after her night and day. She served her husband dinner 
and he wanted to have sex. Her shoulder brushed his as she passed 
in the igloo's passage way and he wanted to have sex again. 
He often woke her up in the middle of the night, his hard penis 
nudging against her soft thigh. 
Soon he'd rubbed inside her so many times, that her vagina 
wore away. The husband didn't see his mistake 
and stroked his penis between her knees until his wife had no more legs. 
He used up her belly and her arms. Her breasts were next 
to disappear. When nothing was left that he could touch, 
Him-Whose-Penis-Never-Slept ejaculated into his wife's shadow. 
It vanished, his semen a liquid ghost dripping down a lonely snow wall.
His two wives never mentioned it, because, other than that, 
he was a nice husband. He hunted big caribou 
and told good stories. He let them sleep near him, 
where it was warm. But one day when they were curing the meat 
while their fired husband rested, one said to the other, 
"Do you love your husband?" 
"Yes," she answered, "Do you?" 
They nudged each other and went to the husband's bed. 
They took off his blanket, then his pants. 
They meant to arouse him but instead they burst out laughing 
at his tiny flaccid penis which was barely even there. 
That woke up the husband. And though the wives wouldn't tell 
why they were laughing, the husband guessed. He asked them to make a fire 
and when they did, he poured oil all over it. 
He threw them in one by one, then jumped in himself, 
his shame that big, his penis that small.
Kinnaq could not get his penis into any of the normal places. 
He often saw women he wanted to fuck, 
but somehow they always got away 
at the last minute. Kinnaq took four girls, 
one by one, across the river just to get to the last one, 
the one he thought the prettiest. When finally 
he had her in his kayak, he let the current take them 
downstream. The girl shouted 
that they were going the wrong way, 
and sensing danger, took the sinew 
that held her braids and tied Kinnaq's parka 
to his kayak. Then she begged him to pull over to the bank 
so she could shit. When he did, she ran up the bluff, 
beyond a point where Kinnaq could see her. 
By the time he began to chase her, 
the intricate knots the girl had made 
forced him to drag his kayak with him. He easily gave up, 
spotting a lemming hole. He took out his penis 
and fucked the burrow instead. 

Another time, Kinnaq fucked the ventilation hole 
on the roof of an igloo in a strange village. 
Two old women who lived inside smelled his penis 
and began to argue over who would have the man first. 
Giggling, they chased Kinnaq all the way to his kayak, 
but he didn't find the old women attractive. 
He pushed off down river, his departure an insult to them, 
an insult to their defiled snow hut. The old women 
cursed Kinnaq's penis, which they called an usak.
As he paddled away, he felt his penis growing, not as a result 
of lust, not as a result of cold. He stuffed his lengthy usak
into his boot, then when it wouldn't stop getting bigger, 
dragged it behind his boat. The children waiting on shore for him 
thought Kinnaq's penis was a catch, so they chopped 
what they thought was a strange fish into bits 
and began chewing pieces of it.
One day a fisherman's penis got tangled up in his harpoon line. 
The fisherman was never really good at catching seals 
and as both prey and hunter tugged and hauled in opposite directions, 
the man felt all the strength gush out of his penis. 
He was relieved, if the truth be known. 
He went home and dressed up like a woman. 
He called himself Vagina and announced he was in need of a husband. 
His mother was not happy about this. 
She threatened to kick her son, who was now her daughter, out of the house 
if he didn't again dress like a man and go out on the hunt. 
Vagina knew a little magic, so she stripped the skin from her body 
until she was just a skeleton. Her mother dropped dead in fright. 
Vagina put her skin back on and started to behave 
more and more like a woman. She fretted with her hair 
and drew little tattoos all over her arms. Monthly 
she made cuts at her groin so she could bleed. 
She spent her days quietly softening fox skins with her teeth. 
Vagina was still having trouble getting a husband 
when a neighbor agreed to loan hers. When Vagina 
removed her dress, the neighbor's husband 
noticed her penis and called Vagina a madman. 
Again, Vagina removed her skin as if to prove deep down 
there was no difference between women and men 
and their skeletons. Instead of consenting to have sex, 
the man was so frightened he fell dead, like Vagina's mother, on the spot. 
Vagina thought at least she could adopt 
and then a child would provide her with company. 
There was an orphan no one else would have. 
Vagina tended to him like the kindest of mothers 
until one day the boy demanded blubber. 
"Can't you see I'm a woman?" Vagina said, 
"I'm not allowed on the hunt. Find yourself a father, 
a husband for me, and then we'll have plenty to eat." 
The orphan was sharp. He had seen Vagina pissing 
while standing up. He accused his mother of being a man. 
Vagina, on impulse, became a skeleton again.
The orphan, instead of being scared, ran his fingers 
over his mother's eyeball sockets and ribs. He drew a circle 
around her pelvis and laughed. Vagina was forced 
to use stronger magic. She reached into her chest 
and pulled out her entrails. "There," she exclaimed, 
"do you still insist on having some blubber?" 
The orphan hugged his mother as some dogs 
burst their way into the igloo, 
stealing, among other things, Vagina's intestines. 
She shouted, "Stop!" and chased the dogs 
for miles. But before she could catch up, the biggest dog had eaten her heart. 
And everyone knows a person is nothing without that. 
Slowly Vagina wasted away as the orphan watched. 
The orphan buried his mother beneath a pile of stones, 
loving her in spite of her magic and foolish penis. 
Loving his dead mother in spite of her skeleton games, 
the orphan went to search for seals and whales and blubber on his own.
A man and a woman couldn't have any children. 
No one knew whose fault it was. This couple was unhappy 
and the butt of jokes. The man sucked on his wife's breasts. 
The woman cradled her husband in her arms. 
But pretending about babies wasn't enough.
So the man headed South where a woman shaman, 
who had gained her powers in being struck by lightning, 
was sometimes able to help the barren. 
The shaman handed the husband two dried fish. 
If you want a boy, give your wife this boy fish. 
It you want a girl, give her the fish that is a girl.
The hopeful husband jumped into his kayak 
anxious to get the fertile fish home. But it wasn't long 
until the husband grew hungry, and weighing 
the fish in both of his palms, decided that it wouldn't be that bad 
to eat the fish that was a girl, since it was a boy child he really wanted. 
So he ate the female fish, the soft bones scraping his throat. 
Soon a cramp, then a bout of nausea that wasn't seasickness. 
By the time he arrived home, he could barely squeeze himself 
out of his boat. His belly stretched far ahead of him 
as though it wanted to leave and walk away on its own. 
His wife recognized the signs and tended to her husband 
day and night. When he gave birth to a little baby girl, 
she slipped through him like a fish and flopped 
into the cold air. What did it matter 
if one of her mothers was also her father?
A long time ago, before women had individual wombs, 
babies were dug up from the earth -- girl children 
underfoot about six inches, boy children hidden deep. 
Industrious women had babies like potatoes, 
digging all day to find infants. Lazy women 
had one or sometimes no children at all. Kaku 
wanted very much to be a mother, but as she plowed 
with sticks and spoons, she found only rocks, 
an occasional ring. She traveled far, overturning 
almost half of the earth and the snow that covered it, 
but birthed no one. The village looked down on her, 
a barren woman, and skeptic eyebrows rose 
when Kaku complained that it wasn't fair, 
she tried so hard. One day, after passing mothers 
with as many as thirteen babies, Kaku 
decided to take drastic measures. She began 
to excavate a distant spot, searching for many days 
past buried treasure, past coffins, through a hot red middle 
she suspected was the sun. It was a long time before 
she popped up like a bubble through a straw 
and was way on the other side of the world. 
Everything there was upside-down. Roots of trees 
swirled where clouds should have been. 
The snow on the ground was white sky. 
People ate with the fines of their forks 
pointed up. Kaku was surprised to learn 
that in this part of the world, babies were bigger 
than their mothers. She was quickly adopted 
by a giant girl and boy baby who fed her 
and washed her and dressed her in new clothes. 
The babies were kinder than any parents 
Kaku could have imagined and, for a while, 
she was happy to be away from the cruelty 
and gossip of her village. But sometimes 
at night she pictured a wreath inside her 
and the empty space within the curving garland 
ached. Soon she ran away from her two huge parents, 
past inverted hills, concaves in the earth, 
past valleys that ballooned higher than any mountains 
back home. The Claw-Trolls tore at her flesh. 
A Scourge-Troll slapped a seal against her groin. 
Still, she traveled on, beyond the violence, 
as her adoptive baby-parents mourned her. 
After many days she found another passageway 
back to the other side of the earth, past worms, 
past skeletons, past that hot middle, that red egg yolk. 
When she had almost reached her village, 
she saw a bulge of dirt that could only mean one thing. 
She tore towards the breathing 
where the most beautiful baby boy was sleeping. 
She took him home to wash him off. 
She slept with the old boy on her chest, 
dreaming dream after dream -- that he would be 
an explorer, some kind of a king, a rich man, 
a man of great discovery.
I tried everything to have a child, 
slept with my naked genitals 
tempting the moonlight, drank 
water when the full moon shone on it. 
The Moon Man was hogging all the unborn babies 
and when he flew to earth to impregnate women, 
he always skipped me. Instead he'd surprise a young girl 
with a child, or throw down an infant 
to a grandmother. It wasn't until my husband 
sent a shaman to visit the Moon 
that the Man up there even learned my name. But our baby 
will be the best baby of all, all that more special 
because we had to wait. 
Now that I am finally pregnant 
my husband gives me his semen every night 
which feeds our baby while she's in me. 
Sometimes a drop remains on his penis 
as pearly white as the moon, 
as pearly round as my womb.
The first mother wanted a baby so badly that she said she would have slept with an evil spirit to get hirn. Of course, she didn't; she slept with her husband, but uttering those words cursed her. Her face shone, like any other woman's during pregnancy, yet this mother needed to eat so much meat to gain even the smallest amount of weight. When her baby was born, its eyes were red. It didn't appear to have formed a sex. Yet all this mother could see was love, so she bit the umbilical chord, then pulled the baby to her breasts. 

The baby's fists were heavy and pointed like spears. It beat its mother and began to eat her. First her little finger, then her knuckles. Then her arms, then her torso. When nothing was left, the baby began to smack its own chest, until it cried its first cry, then died. 

* * *
The second mother was so lonely she took home a larva and nursed it under her armpit. Her baby was white as a cloud, smoke, or snow. She taught the larva to talk in the evenings. She was proud, as it was growing to be the biggest larva in the village. Sometimes the mother became fired giving her child so much blood and needed a walk in the brisk air to revive her. 

When the larva grew bigger than its mother, it begged to go out and see the other snow-huts and meet some neighbors. The mother allowed this, though like all mothers she worried about her child's safety. The villagers were afraid of the gigantic larva which resembled a dead spirit. The larva was kind and sang gentle songs, but, due to its appearance, it could not easily win affection. 

One day when the mother was away, and the larva was home playing, a group of people stormed into the snow-hut where the woman lived, and threw her baby-larva to a pack of dogs. There was blood everywhere when the dogs were finished because even that many dogs couldn't eat so much blood. 

* * *
The third mother's baby was nothing but air, except for the dust particles that were its eyes. Some thought she was making the whole baby thing, up, that because this mother wanted a baby so badly, she dreamt it. Her husband tolerated the baby made of air, but never paid it too much attention. When he wasn't away hunting, he liked to overeat then sleep as many as twelve hours in a row. 

The mother sang her baby songs about the days when igloos could fly, when all air really was full of mystery. She blew hot breath onto the invisible baby's neck, as she would a piece of frozen fish so that her lips or tongue wouldn't stick when she ate. 

Only once did this mother begin to scold her baby, and as she took a deep angry breath, she sucked the baby up. The baby's head went through its mother's nostril, like it was being born backwards. The mother snorted, hoping to push her baby back out. That's not my baby, she said, after each huff. That's not it either. The husband woke from one of his naps, hungry. He looked up with a start -- accusing, what happened to the baby?
A young couple adored their baby 
who was enlanting and bubbly as babies go. 
One day while they were out drying fish 
in a nearby hut, a man came along and began singing. 
This young couple loved to dance 
as they were still newlyweds. They didn't 
notice the singer's feet were a wolf's paws 
tucked cleverly inside his snow shoes. 
The wolf-man put the couple in a trance, 
as his wolf-wife stole their fat brown baby. 
The couple spent days following wolf tracks 
after they'd found wolf hairs in the baby's bedding. 
When they finally found the den, 
they burst in with arrows. They successfully 
killed the thieves without noticing their baby 
hidden under the she-wolf. Their arrows 
went right through the baby's heart. 
The man and woman fought over whose fault it was 
and never again danced in each other's arms.
Atungaq and his wife set out to travel around the world 
with no idea how big the world really was. 
Atungaq imagined it would take a year, at most, on foot. 
They took their two children, a young girl and an infant. 
Their first stop was the village of The Laced Ones, a jolly people 
who held their garments together with caribou sinew. 
They came upon The Dwarfs, then a village of Lopsided People, 
each with only one hipbone, whose kayaks easily capsized. 
It was not until they reached The Clawed Ones 
that they ran into danger. Their older daughter 
was stopped on her way to get firewood by a woman 
whose nails were as big as the daws of a snowy owl. 
The woman scratched the girl to death and ate her, 
her poor heart bouncing on the floor, 
trying to reach her father. Atungaq fled with his wife 
and baby to the land of the Ones Who Make Mistakes. 
Here their baby was taken away by a woman 
who took a needle to his fontanel and sucked out 
all his young blood. Atungaq and his wife fled again, 
and made it home, heartbroken to have lost their children, 
but bragging they'd survived the dangers of the world 
when they'd only really survived the dangers of the pole.
If you eat intestines during your pregnancy, your child will turn into a worm. 
Even though she knew this, this mother-to-be was craving reindeer 
jejunum, duodenum, and ileum. And besides, there was not much else to eat. 
She said her prayers, hoping for the best, forgetting her forbidden meal 
in a few months, when she had no signs of ill health. 
Her baby was big, her delivery anything but easy. 
"Fly out like a sledge over smooth ice," coaxed the midwife 
and the child finally emerged. The new mother obeyed all the other taboos. 
She covered her head, and sat in the dark for eight days. 
She rubbed every bite of food she wanted to eat 
across the lips of her child first. Even so, 
the child grew thinner and more transparent. 
He played by making coils out of his own body. 
His mother begged him to stop, to eat some meat, 
but soon the worm-child slithered away, never to be seen again. 
A gang of brothers wouldn't let their only sister marry. 
They wanted her around to mend mukluks 
and dry the fish they caught. The sister became pregnant 
though she had no official husband
and feared what would happen if her brothers found out.  
She took the baby outside of her before it was ready, 
but not soon enough so that it would be nothing but blood. 
The discarded infant paddled away in a boat he made 
from the skull of the dog. He used a human arm bone for a paddle. 
The sister never knew this, that her baby came to visit 
and suck her breasts while she was sleeping. 
One by one her brothers died mysterious deaths. 
The baby used its powers -- he only wanted his mother back. 
The sister consulted a shaman, 
telling him that what she brought forth was no real baby, 
but that maybe it had something to do with her dead brothers. 
The baby finally heard the truth, and understood 
he wasn't ready for this world. He was born a little while later 
to another mother who had no selfish brothers.
It's hard for a starving mother to give birth, 
and a miracle that this one did at all. 
To have the energy to push, to have the strength 
to keep her knees up and her legs in a vee. 
There was nothing to feed her new baby -- 
no prospect of food for months, 
the breathing holes for catching seals 
all covered up by blizzards. The mother ate 
her baby to keep herself alive. 
The act was quick, stronger than an instinct. 
We could not blame her 
though we knew it was a mistake 
that she did not go to the Land of the Dead 
with her child. For then the childless mother 
was paralyzed. Frozen in one position forever. 
It was as though she had eaten her very own hand.
Chief Oohmehk decided to have a big feast 
because this was the first time in a long time 
a hunt had brought home so much food -- 
seals, belugas, ugruks, and caribous. 
For three days, everyone danced and ate. 
Everyone except one baby. His mother 
was so busy making ice cream, feeding 
her other children and her husband 
and her widowed mother-in-law, 
that when she fell asleep, her baby's stomach was empty. 
During the night, the baby sucked 
at his mother's breasts, first the right 
then the left, the slit of his mouth growmg 
until the tips of his lips reached his ears. In one instant, 
he sprouted teeth sharper than a wolf's 
and the milk wasn't enough. 
He started eating his mother's breasts. 
The baby's grandmother heard -- and then 
the husband and the other children -- 
a slurping and crunching, an obscene chewing. 
They saw the baby devouring his mother's neck, 
her shoulders and her thighs. The father 
and mother-in-law jumped through the skylight, 
the other children not far behind. 
Their screams woke the whole village, 
and everyone fled, Chief Oohmehk 
leaving his prized jade knife behind. 
The baby, not satisfied with the mere flesh 
of his mother, jumped after his people, 
and in the spring of his hopping, 
lost his diaper. His shrill cries 
woke the people of his village 
who escaped by crossing the lagoon 
on logs. When the baby tried to cross after them 
a brave young girl rolled the tree stump 
under his step and, with a splash, 
the baby disappeared. Just then 
a head of beautiful black hair 
rose to the surface. It was the lady 
with the fish body. She told Chief Oohmehk 
she would care for this hungry baby 
but that no one could cross the water 
back to the village. In time, 
people forgot the horror and tried to go home 
to fetch a lamp or a favorite rug. All were swallowed up 
in the black muck of the water -- which was empty 
and harmless, so it seemed, on the surface, 
a soup stock without any meat.
In the end it was hauling the snow that got to him. 
This orphan lived with his grandparents 
who bossed him around, in crankier and crankier tones 
as they all grew older. Their igloo 
was by the sea where the water was too salty to drink. 
So the orphan had to lug soft snow from a faraway hill. 
There were other chores, and, of course, the spankings. 
There was his guilt of putting a strain on his grandparents. 
And the rage -- his own parents gone. 
He couldn't even remember them. 
One day as his grandfather scolded the orphan 
about something small, and the grandmother 
ranted about a forgotten chore, the orphan 
began to sing. It was a song he always knew 
but hesitated to use. He ran to open the skylight 
and tear the bearded seal guts from the window. 
The orphan's magic song made snow, just as real and cold 
as the one that fell from the sky. The faster his words 
the stormier the weather. The igloo 
was filling up like a bowl. The grandparents 
couldn't move fast enough and were buried alive 
by what they always wanted the most.
It was a terrible time of starvation. 
The village decided to migrate, leaving the weak ones behind. 
One was a baby girl. Her mother cried, 
leaving her wrapped up in her own parka. 
When the village people found food, they returned to feed 
their abandoned relatives. The mother longed 
to see her baby alive in the warm jacket fleece, 
but tried not to have high hopes. So she was 
shocked to see her baby, still toothless 
and whining, bound out of the snow hut, 
bigger than a giant. The mother's parka was a small scarf 
around the giant baby's neck. The giant baby 
was so strong she could walk bare oot 
in the snow, her naked skin unchafed by the wind. 
The mother screamed. The whole village 
ran away, this giant baby 
running after them, drooling icicles. 
When the baby grew tired, she began to crawl. 
Those of the village moved so fast 
that when they looked behind them 
the giant baby was just a dot.
Every once in a while you'll see him: 
the spirit full of tattoos. You'll know it is him 
because of the vulva on his chin. 
His cheeks are two big breasts, nipples 
like pimples. Two little legs stick out of his neck. 
Sometimes he appears in the trash 
because he doesn't want the hungry to get even the scraps.
Daughters can move to faraway villages. 
When this happens, sometimes mothers cry 
and lose weight. Sometimes their faces turn gray 
and they sew more slowly. An old woman 
who missed her daughter had a solution. 
She named her dog the same name as her daughter. 
When she fed him she pretended 
she was feeding her child. When she called her dog, 
she called the girl, until sure enough 
the daughter heard her through the miles 
that separated them and came to visit.
He didn't live anywhere near his settlement, 
his tiny igloo too small to stand up in, 
impossible to lie down. Tiligvak 
was a simple man with extraordinary powers. 
During a bad winter he summoned 
a seal from the floor of the central snow hut. 
The seals had loved him ever since his first catch 
when he took off both his inner and outer jacket 
and rubbed his skin against the mammal's with love. 
The people of the village praised Tiligvak 
though they often gossiped about his strange hermit ways. 
At least until the day he fed his whole settlement 
with a bite of meat, a few tongues, 
and a small helping of marrow. 
He put the scraps on his magic seal skin plate 
and sang a song until the meat overflowed. 
Not even this bunch of his hungry neighbors 
could finish such a feast, Tifigvak's magic plate 
a piece of seal skin his people had foolishly thrown away.
This is what they called the day 
her first blood came, the day she was too old 
for her long slender doll made of reindeer bone. 
It had taken a long time for her to learn 
how to sew seal intestines without tearing them, 
how to guide the ulu 
so no part of an animal's hide was wasted. 
She'd given her bone doll a wolverine ruff 
because breath would not freeze 
on that kind of fur. Though her father 
carved her a doll with no arms, 
she'd made parka sleeves from the seamless skin 
of a ground squirrel's front legs. 
She'd crimped the doll's moccasins with her teeth, 
double checked each stitch to make sure 
no wind or ice could pass through it. 
An ill-sewn garment could mean death. 
An ill-made marriage could mean unhappiness. 
Her dolls' outfits were perfect as her mother 
packed them away. The sticky blood, 
slow and strange between her legs. She grew 
dizzy as her family began to talk 
of husbands and babies. She was an animal 
strung upside-down, drained before drying. 
Her hands never to touch skins that small again.
The dance house went dark 
when a wind blew out all the lamps. 
The singing continued in the blackness 
while a boy raped a young girl. 
He ran away just before the lamps 
were re-lit, and the girl, crying, 
made her way home on the crunchy snow. 
She was a girl who loved to dance 
and didn't want this pleasure taken from her, 
so the next night she returned to the dance house 
with soot on her hands, so that if this violence 
happened again, she'd dirty 
her attacker's back. After the second time -- 
the terrifying darkness, the pain, the rekindle -- 
the girl saw tier palm prints on her brother's parka. 
She cried, "Such things are unheard of!" 
Her body still felt the ache of his presence 
as she took a sharp knife and cut off both her breasts. 
She flung them into his hands, screaming, 
"You seem to have a taste for my body -- Eat these!" 
He held her bleeding breasts, in shock. 
She grabbed a torch and fled the dance house. 
No one is sure if the brother meant to apologize 
or simply attack his sister again, when he followed, 
stumbling and falling, snow putting out the flames 
of his torch so that only its embers flickered. 
A wind, more colossal than the one that disturbed 
the dance hall lamps, lifted the man 
and his breastless sister up high into the sky. 
The girl became the sun who does all she can 
to alleviate the dangers of the dark. 
She stays as far away as possible 
from her brother, the cold dim moon.
There was a woman who refused to marry. 
She lived with her parents, who always told suitors 
the decision to wed belonged to their daughter. 
One day in winter an old shaman sought her. 
She refused his proposal with a loud 
"Naami, no!" He blamed her rejection 
on his sagging skin and white beard. 
This usually kind man took his revenge. 
The shaman used his magic 
to follow the girl everywhere. 
He would stand in the entrance passage 
of each igloo she visited. 
To get away from him, she ran 
from one hut to another, but he always beat her 
to her destination. He said nothing, 
just smiled, not a nice smile, 
but a prideful one that showed his satisfaction
of winning. After many days of this, 
the girl began to stay home, 
the whiteness all around leaving her 
no place to hide. Although the shaman 
could do anything -- like make himself young and handsome -- 
he chose to age the girl in her sleep. 
One night, all her front teeth 
fell out on her pillow, her hair turned gray, 
and the whites of her eyes yellowed. 
The parents wept for their daughter, the crone-virgin, 
and hoped she wouldn't die 
before them. For several days, the shaman let the girl live 
as an old woman, knowing aching joints 
and palsied hands. When he finally came to her igloo 
she couldn't even stand. 
The girl who was an old woman 
sat at the edge of her cot 
as the shaman caused a seal to pass through her. 
The slippery mammal tickled her vagina 
without the usual pain of birth. 
Her hair slowly turned back to black 
and the flesh that hung in every direction 
tightened once again to her bones. 
"Well?" said the shaman. The young girl yelped 
as her teeth returned through her gums all at once. 
She followed the shaman out of the hut, 
her powerless parents holding each other. 
The wedding was little more than a rape, an intrusion 
through the most delicate passage way. 
The young girl said, "For some, there is no freedom."
This murderer of wives thought he had an excuse. 
On the day he was born, his father was killed 
by a group of evil spirits who drilled holes in his knees 
and sucked out all his juices. This murderer's mother 
vowed to make her son strong, pulling on his knuckles. 
The boy grew up triple-speed, rowing a kayak at two. 
At three, he killed his first seal. Soon he was hitting his head 
against the wall of his igloo because he needed a wife. 
When his mother told him he was still a child, 
the boy cried out that he was a man, too. 
The mother could not stand to see her son suffer 
so they began a journey to find a suitable woman. 
First, they tried the village of the Dog-Heads. 
This son was desperate. He picked a woman 
with not a bad-looking body. Their first night together 
this Dog-Headed woman tried to eat the boy's genitals. 
He killed her, and told his mother they would have to search further. 
In the next village, all the woman were taken but one 
and she had fingernails longer than a harpoon. 
Their first night in bed, she scraped the boy's back 
bragging that in this way she had made skeletons 
out of many men. Afraid for his fife, the boy killed her, too. 
The murderer's mother was too old and feeble to continue. 
She walked off a cliff, leaving the boy on his own. 
The third wife came from a village where women were abundant. 
She had blue-black hair and could clean a seal. 
Her hands were nice and fat. 
This seemed to be the love of the murderer's life 
until he realized she was barren. Fed up, he threw her 
into the sea. The rest of the village was furious. 
For this was not a place where killing women was acceptable. 
As punishment, the murderer had to marry 
a woman no one else would take. 
She never said a word. She knew nothing of mending 
sealskin boots. Her eyes were covered by a dull glaze. 
She didn't have any stories to tell. 
The murderer finally repented, crying on the graves 
of his former wives, stretching the knuckles 
on his enormous hands. He was still young, 
with many more years to live.
There was a husband who was more than a little ill-tempered. 
Though he didn't beat his wife, he tended 
to be too demanding for her tastes. Besides that, 
he wasn't a very good hunter. The wife watched 
as the other men in her neighborhood dragged home 
yummy seals. She waited for her husband 
who inevitably arrived empty-handed. 
He always walked into the igloo without a hello, 
wanting her to get him a drink of water. 
She said she wouldn't give him a sip 
until he brought home some meat. 
She was tired of taking handouts from the other hunters. 
She said things that she shouldn't have said, 
things that made him feel less of a man. 
One night after one of their fights, when she still 
refused to quench her husband's thirst, 
he said, "I'm fed up! No water? No husband." 
He walked out of the hut, vowing to never come back. 
On his walk the hunter with bad luck 
came upon a house where three magical bears lived. 
He told them his troubles, his head in their furry laps. 
He stayed among the bears, learning their secrets, 
until he missed his wife. Not one for fancy apologies, 
he walked through the igloo door saying, 
"Am I thirsty! How about a drink?" 
His wife thought at first it was some kind of joke. 
But when she didn't see her husband smile, 
she said, "Still no seal? Then no water!" 
The husband stared at the bearskin on the sleeping cot 
sending messages to the bears, just as they'd taught him. 
The loud paws of large bears could be heard 
circling the hut. A furry foot crashed through 
the ice-window of their igloo. "Here is your water," 
cooed the wife, calling her husband darling 
for the first time in a very long while.
This liar would do anything to get out of hunting, 
even trample his kayak, and put ice in his clothes, 
then hammer his own testicles with a stone. 
This is the trouble a liar will go to 
when he wants his wife to believe he's been victim of an iceberg. 

This liar would do anything to get out of hunting. 
When he heard of a child's death, he went to her parents to say 
he had a daughter by the same name. The grieving parents 
wanted their daughter's soul to go into the liar's child's 
so they gave him food and her pearls, a cooking pot. 

The liar was rich until the mourning family learned 
the liar had no child at all. They demanded he give the food back. 
They demanded he apologize to the spirit of their dead daughter. 
The liar couldn't sleep at night, the lies in his head 
crawling over one another like so many lice. 

His wife was ashamed. His friend had had enough of him 
when he claimed he caught a whale that turned out to be a stone. 
He led one faulty expedition after another. 
Any number of people could have been the one who killed him, 
down beyond the cliff where that dead whale should have been.
There once was a man so lazy 
he swallowed his bites of food almost whole 
rather than take the extra energy to chew. 
When he saw a blurry commotion 
through the ice-window of his snow-hut, 
he guessed at what was happening 
rather than rise from his cot 
to get a better look. He was happiest 
sleeping, drips of spittle freezing 
in the comers of his lips. 
He resented any kind of work. 
His job was to go out to the land 
to scare the caribou, chase them 
towards the crossing place 
where his fellow hunters waited 
with their kayaks. This was 
a hard enough job for a peppy Turnit, 
but for the lazy Turnit 
it was near impossible. Instead 
he spent his days resting in the snow, 
alert at first, afraid that he would be caught, 
then dozing when he closed his eyes to the sun. 
To satisfy his wife, the lazy man 
situated himself by a large stone. 
While he was still lying down 
he rested his feet against the rock 
and rubbed them back and forth. 
He often gave his shoes to his wife to re-sole 
until she ran out of caribou skins. 
It had been a long time since the hunters 
had a catch, but the wife didn't complain 
because, from the looks of his shabby shoes, 
the husband had tried so hard. 
When his fellow hunters got hungry enough, 
they decided to spy on their lazy friend. 
Sure enough, they found him lying down, 
shuffling in place on the stone. 
They watched the lazy man who had learned 
to walk and walk, to save time, in his sleep. 
They watched him walk to nowhere all day, 
then limp home, hoping for something to eat.
This raven, when he looked into the eyes of humans, 
felt a grumble in his stomach as big as an avalanche. 
He would start to salivate, the tender brown eyes 
of men and women, girls and boys, moist and succulent 
as the wettest of grasses. It was hard to catch the eyes 
of live humans, with their lids shutting 
like igloos, their arms flailing, throwing off his pecking. 
So this ravenous raven devised a plan. 
He told the pretty-eyed people of a large settlement 
to come down near the sea to greet a group of guests. 
The lonely people were excited and started 
in the direction the raven advised. 
As soon as the humans were under a summit, 
the raven began to dance on the enormous overhang of snow, 
which broke off in chunks bigger than snow huts. 
The whole settlement was buried in a matter of seconds. 
The raven had to wait until spring. To him, the melting snow 
was as beautiful as a slow-cooking fire. 
When it was warm, he emptied the human's eye sockets, 
his beak delicately spooning egg yolks from egg cups.
She wasn't a giant. And no, her vagina 
didn't have teeth. Instead it was like a hollow snake 
able to swallow whole big things. 
This woman's vagina didn't lead, like others, 
to a womb. Instead its slippery path 
pulled men like metal right to her magnet stomach. 
There, the men churned with blubber and seal meat 
she'd recently eaten. Other women looked for the remnants 
of their missing husbands in the shit 
of Her-Whose-Vagina-Ate-Men. Sometimes, 
a gold tooth, an unmistakable button. 
Widows didn't cry much. They knew 
a stray husband was worth less than a dog -- 
which wives could at least have for supper 
if they grew hungry enough.
Petrel was altricial, 
born helpless, with closed eyes. 
He lived high on the cliffs 
where he was safe. The Kittiwakes 
and Razorbills built their nests 
halfway up or on the ground. 
With thick coats of natal down, 
they were getting their own food 
before Petrel could even fly. 

In a snow-hut near by, 
Sedna stood, her head in the tropics, 
her waist in a temperate zone. 
Her feet were cold. Such was the nature 
of the igloo in which she lived -- animal skins 
lining the walls, the nostril hole 
in the roof, letting out bad air. 
Sedna was proud, refusing the suitors 
who came to court her. 

After Petrel had been a long time pampered, 
he turned himself into a man, 
knowing no mere bird was a worthy wife. 
He wore a handsome parka 
and spectacles made from walrus tusks 
to disguise his beady eyes, 
the only part of him that didn't easily transform. 
He was able to coax Sedna away from her home 
with his songs, his voice still sweet as a bird's. 

Sedna was happy until Petrel's glasses fell off, 
and the trance was broken. 
She looked at the nest in which she'd been living 
and shrieked. She jumped into her father's boat 
that had long been searching for her. 
Petrel swooped down towards the sea, 
flapping his wings, making waves. 
Sedna's fathers and brothers pushed her 
from the boat, afraid of the powerful spirits. 

Blue with cold, Sedna came to the surface, 
grabbing at the side of the kayak, her fingers 
turning to ice. Her brothers 
hit at her hands with a paddle. 
Her fingertips broke off 
and turned into sea lions. Sedna. tried once more 
to save her life -- her second joints split away 
and became ground seals. The next time 
her third joints became walruses 

and her thumbs sprang into whales. 
A great wave drowned Sedna's family. 
Petrel's cry woke the Kittiwakes 
and Razorbills. Sedna became a powerful spirit -- 
living as low as Petrel did high -- sending winds 
and wrecking kayaks. When she is happy 
she leads seals to hunters. Without fingers, 
she can no longer plait her own braids, 
each as thick as an arm.
This woman had no children but she had a unipkaaq
a story better than a pop-up book, better than a spell. 
She'd never told her husband since everyone knows 
you can never trust a man to keep a secret. 
One long night her husband begged for a story 
as though he were the baby she'd never had. 
She had told all the stories she could, 
the ones that didn't move lamps or stir up spirits. 
Her husband grew bored, saying: not that one, not that one 
again. Finally, the woman said she would tell of her magic 
if he promised not to tell the men in the qa1gi.
It was dangerous for a woman whose powers were known 
because the men who were visionaries outnumbered her. 
The woman sat in the middle of their igloo 
stirring her hand sun-wise, until her husband 
heard splashing water, until her husband 
saw water rising on their floor, and finally 
a whale. The wife asked for reassurance 
from her husband who was shaking. He promised 
not to tell as they ate pieces of whale skin 
and blubber. The next day the man went to work 
with a piece of whale meat in his cheek. 
He was chewing silently when his friends noticed 
he was eating something freshly caught. 
Through a series of badgering questions, the man confessed. 
His friends demanded he bring his wife to the qa1gi.
The exposed woman had no choice: 
the next day she repeated her story 
while she directed her husband to stay up by the igloo's skylight. 
The stirring, the water, and finally the whale. 
But this time the woman didn't end her story 
until her husband pulled her through the nose of the igloo 
and the qa1gi was flooded, all the men drowned. 
Shamans north and south of Tikigaq began to visit 
in the form of duck's down or caribou hair. 
As they filtered in through her igloo's nose, 
she always recognized them, 
transformed them back into their real selves, 
and chopped off their heads. When enough 
of the neighboring shamans were dead, war parties 
came into Tikiga Th woman felt sad 
about the death at secrets can cause, and she didn't have time 
to blame her husband. Instead, as the warriors 
approached the village, she stretched out her arms in front of her 
and rubbed the white undersides against each other 
until they were raw. The earth opened 
and the warriors went toppling in, 
never to bother Tikigaq again.
She was her only granddaughter -- tall, beautiful, big 
for her age. On her way home one night, 
the granddaughter was dragged into the men's recreation hut 
where each of the boys inside used her. 
She crawled home all bloody. 
The grandmother plotted her revenge. 
When at last the girl slept, the grandmother returned to the hut 
with her magic. She crawled like her granddaughter 
and put her fingers in her mouth. The bare-chested boys laughed -- 
they were hot after all that raping. But the grandmother 
put the boys in a trance so that they began following her, 
out of the hut and, on all fours, into the snow. 
She took them by the river where ice formed in their hair. 
She took them by a rarely used trail where their arms turned blue. 
Most died on the way to the mountain. When all the boys were frozen 
the grandmother ran home to her granddaughter. 
The girl rested and woke up feeling safe -- 
her dream of huge evil babies chilled forever into place.
I was left alone with only grandmother, 
as the youngest and oldest of our village, prohibited 
from the narwhal hunt. No one came back 
for years, not mother nor father, not the girls nor boys 
who I imagine would by now kiss my cheeks 
with snowballs, if they were still here. 
Luckily for me, my grandmother was magic. 
With a few words and a trance, she could turn herself 
into a man. Her seal-bone penis 
was always full of pleasure, her blubber-balls 
were always warm. And being a man, she was able 
to get food without as much danger. Her vagina 
transformed into a mighty sled. She created 
a team of dogs from her own lice. I spent my days 
hidden in the hut, sewing animal skins and singing. 
Grandmother always returned by evening, 
sometimes with a ptarmigan, his dead feathered feet 
stiff in the cold. I learned how to cook 
all kinds of soup. This went on for many days of dark 
and light, many years and changes in my body. 
Sometimes I feared my handsome grandmother's death 
and wondered if I'd be able to hunt for myself. 
How could I sleep without her curled into me? 
It came to pass that I would have other worries. 
One day when I was alone a man came to our house. 
His penis was real skin and blood. He showed me 
his wrinkled testicles with pride. He wanted to know 
whose harpoon stood in the corner. Whose kayak 
leaned against the wall. Whose child filled my belly. 
I told him they all belonged to my grandmother, 
my husband. I kicked as he threw me over his shoulder, 
promising he would make me a happier wife. 
Grandmother returned that evening as usual, 
a walrus roped onto her sled. She cried out my name 
over and over, looking for boiling water, some proof 
that I was coming back. She saw no point 
in hunting or eating anything else. She saw no point 
in being a man any more. She undid 
her magic spell -- man or woman, it's all the same 
when a person dies alone.
She once had a cushioned womb, 
a zestful kitchen, necklaces that dangled 
feathers and beads. Her daughter 
was just a baby then, crying for milk, 
not the only one left to take care of her mother. 

The old woman was blind now 
and crippled, often ill-tempered. 
The daughter would have preferred 
to wait on a husband or children 
so one day when the mother asked for water 

the fed-up girl handed her a bowl of urine. 
The old woman drank, pretending 
she did not know the difference. Her daughter 
did not have a pretty smile or eyes 
that sparkled. The mother who pitied her child 

said, "Which would you prefer as a lover, a louse 
or a sea scorpion?" The daughter no man would have 
chose the creature from the ocean, 
fearing she'd roll over and crush 
a tiny louse-husband in her sleep. 

The old woman knew she had lived too long 
and began pulling sea scorpions, one 
after the other, from her vagina, 
until her daughter was surrounded by suitors, 
until the old woman fell over dead.
This old woman was left behind 
because she didn't even have the strength 
to sit in her comer and chew hides for boots. 

When it was time for her village to move, 
her family said goodbye, giving her only a few insects to eat. 
The old woman accepted her death, thinking, 

I'm not going to eat these creatures. I am old 
and perhaps they are young. Perhaps 
some of these lice are even children.

When she hadn't eaten for a few days 
a fox slunk into her igloo. She prepared herself 
for the Land of the Dead as the fox bared his teeth. 

But instead of eating the old woman, 
he simply bit off her clothes, then her skin -- 
so gently she didn't even feel it. 

Her old skin lay around her ankles like a pair of trousers 
and when she looked down her new skin was firm, 
like that of a young woman. 

The insects, used to being eaten by humans 
who didn't think twice about it, 
had asked their fox friend to lend his magic. 

When the family returned next summer, 
they looked everywhere for the woman's bones -- 
under piles of rocks, in her favorite cave. 

They didn't know she'd gone off to five with the insects. 
It is said she married a handsome blow-fly 
who stayed by her side, forever faithful.
The woman with two vaginas tried her best 
to hide them from her husband. It was difficult 
because her vaginas weren't in the usual place 

but in the palms of her hands. To distract her husband, 
she tickled his penis with her nipple, 
or she took him into her backside. 

She had traveled far, from a place she preferred 
not to talk about, and her husband assumed 
she learned her sexual practices there. He was happy 

until he discovered his wife 
pissing through her fingers, as though she were trying 
to cup running water. He wished 

that he didn't know what he then knew -- 
that his sexy young wife was also a ghost. 
This was no time for sentimental lust -- 

a ghost can only bring loneliness to a snow hut. 
So he strapped his wife into his kayak 
and deposited her on an ice-floe far from home. 

He told her to go back to the Land of the Dead, 
but she was trapped like a moving shadow 
that was neither here nor there. Some say 

they still hear her sobbing: "My husband 
will not have me! My husband will not have me!" 
But she has no way of knowing how he misses her 

twin vaginas, how he tries his best to 
hide it from his new wife -- yet the village is small, 
the gossip as fast as wind during a storm. 

It's said he makes his new wife slap his face, 
to feel the warm tingle of her fingers, 
that he then cries out into her barren palms.
The father was more than surprised to see his dead daughter 
looking for fish on the drying rack. "Where have you been?" 
he asked, sneaking up on her and grabbing her by the waist. 
I have been in a beautiful place, a long way off," 
she said, telling her father she had to go back. 
He pleaded with her and called to his wife. 
The parents cried until their dead daughter consented to stay. 
This ghost of a daughter only meant to find the fish 
she left behind, then leave. She was unhappy 
in the snow hut, lonesome for where she had been. 
Sometimes her parents saw right through her 
and to the wall. Their daughter sulked, faded in and out. 
The mother and father bought her to the potlach,
proud to have their daughter back. People snubbed the girl, 
afraid, remembering her funeral. Someone 
introduced her to the five-year-old who had taken her name. 
Their shared soul split as the child let out a mighty scream. 
The dead girl disappeared, a raindrop in soft snow.
This poor boy lost his mother to the powerful tides, 
and then his father. His sister took care of him for a while, 
but she soon drowned, too. Left alone 
this boy had little strength in his legs or his loins. 
He was forbidden from the hunts. 
Women mocked him. Children giggled 
behind his back. His only friends were the ghosts 
who came to visit when all the others were away. 
They wrestled and told stories, and included 
the frail boy in their fun. His dead sister was the ghost 
who gave the boy a choice: Tell nothing about our visits 
and you will grow stronger. Tell about us 
and you will lose the little vigor you have.
The boy chose to tell about the ghosts 
and the villagers laughed at his expense. 
With each detail of his story, the boy grew weaker, 
until he was ready to be taken by the ghosts themselves. 
In the Land of the Dead he became a beautiful woman, 
one of the ghosts who didn't bother traveling back to earth to help.
She found his dead wives buried in the back. So this was the man 
who destroyed everything he loved. He was her second husband, 
her first so jealous that he locked her in the igloo, with a circle of sticks 
around her so she couldn't move. She wasn't sure what to do -- 
her son was constantly crying for food. She was a long way from home. 
At night she watched her second husband shave wood with his flint 
Until now she was able to avoid his touch, so as not to end up like 
his former wives. His penis-blade glistened as her second husband came 
near her, his eyes swollen with tears. She smiled and coaxed him to their 
cot, then using all her strength shoved him high into the air. 
The flint point of his penis stuck into the very same wooden bed frame 
it had made. The woman, both lucky and not, strapped her baby onto her 
back and ran towards home, through days of darkness. Magic women 
blew their breath into the baby's mouth so she didn't have to 
carry him anymore -- fast and strong, he could run by her side.
I couldn't believe what I saw. 
My big hooded seal, dead on the snow, 
enough food to let me stay home for a while. 
I snuck to the back of the hut to surprise my pretty wife 
who hadn't seen me for days. I saw instead my mother 
with her shirt open, moving her breasts up and down. 
She was singing, "Sleep with me, my dear little wife." 
The women I loved giggled together. My wife 
was the female, my mother the man, 
with a sealbone penis strapped to her waist. 
I had to punish my mother. I struck her so hard 
that I killed her. I urged my wife 
to come with me and leave our hut, that my mother 
had placed a curse on it. My mother 
was as dead as the seal I killed, blood spurting 
from her lip, the snow pink beneath her. 
My wife was in shock, crying, 
"You killed my dear husband." 
She wouldn't look at me for days. 
She wouldn't eat the seal meat. 
She wouldn't stop her crying.
In a village where all the men were killed, 
the women had no choice 
but to take their sons as husbands. 
As one mother strapped her newborn boy 
onto her back, he immediately grew into a man. 
He remained the size of an infant 
but had a stubbly chin and wise eyes. 
The woman carried him everywhere, 
over shallow streams where the water reaching 
over her ankles could easily wet his groin. 
She had to hold him while he peed, 
like a miniature airplane, over the ground. 
He was so light her back never tired, 
even though along with him she carried 
a supply of his arrows. The little husband 
was a wonderful hunter, able to sneak up 
on resting reindeer, his weight so slight 
he left no footprints. The woman rarely missed 
conventional sex, her little husband 
crawling over all over her body 
as though she were one giant breast.
When the big woman first came to the village, everyone thought 
she was a man. She went out on the hunts and bossed 
the rest of the party around. She could snap a live caribou's neck 
with her bare hands. Only one woman was nice to her. 
She gave her chunks of the meat she dried. 
She went to visit the big woman who lived alone in her igloo. 
The big woman never said thank you, only grunted 
when the other woman brought her a new parka. 
One night the big woman snuck into the kind woman's hut 
and crawled under the blankets right between her and her husband. 
"I need a man," she said. The wife tried not to get mad, 
but eventually elbowed the big woman out of the bed 
before the husband woke up. The next day the big woman 
wanted to fight. The kind woman who had little experience 
had no choice. The two women wrestled near a cliff. 
The big woman threw the smaller one into the air. 
There she met a bird spirit who would help her. 
The little woman landed back on earth with a thud. 
She felt a surge of power in her arms, 
then tossed the big woman into the ocean 
where her heaviness was no longer a problem where she 
lived as a whale who bebopped about and swam in peace. 
So even when she thought she was being mean to her big friend, 
the kind woman was still being kind.
So strong was Sermerssuaq 
she could lift a kayak 
on the tip of three fingers, kill 
a seal with her fists, rip a fox apart 
with bare teeth, beat the men 
at arm-wrestling. Sermerssuaq 
liked to show off 
her purple clitoris -- 
which grew so big when she was excited -- 
a hare's pelt 
could barely 
cover it.
He slept in the middle of the igloo, 
near the lamp, while each one of his two wives 
shivered near the wall. It wasn't fair -- 
the way he thrashed them when they giggled. 
The way he thrashed any man who paid either wife 
a compliment. The angry husband killed a villager 
when it was rumored he had slept 
with one of the wives. The two women 
made a pact to flee their husband 
and hiked to the coast in special mukluks 
they'd sewn for the trip. They made their new home 
inside the carcass of a whale who'd washed up 
on the beach. They crawled through his mouth, 
careful not to rip their shoes on his teeth, 
and rested against the walls of his belly. 
The whale's meat lasted them forever, 
his rotten insides as tasty as potent cheese. 
The husband consulted a shaman, 
who led him right towards the whale. 
But the husband feared the awful smell 
and returned to beat the shaman, 
rather than the wives 
who now slept in the warmth 
of each other, in the yellow glow 
of a blubber lamp they shared.
A giant woman ran in pursuit of a human man 
after he'd killed her husband with a giant ax. 
The human, not knowing what else to do, 
thrust the giant ax through the snow 
hoping to split the world in half -- 
his side for humans, the other for giants. 
He thrust with all his might 
but could not get his wish. 
All he managed to gouge out was a lake, 
which the thirsty giantess began to sip. 
The human encouraged her to drink more, 
taunted her by saying she'd have to finish the whole lake 
if she ever wanted to get to the other shore 
to kill him. The giantess drank to her fill, 
her bloated stomach extended like a full moon. 
The human laughed, reminded her how tasty 
his flesh would be on her tongue. She had been out for wood 
just so she could roast him, her husband 
capturing the human earlier in the day. Dead husband or not, 
wasn't she still hungry? The giantess grew dizzy, 
all that water ruining her equilibrium. 
She lumbered towards the human, 
lake water now only up to her hefty shins. 
Then suddenly, without warning, she burst, 
her insides flooding the landscape with mist. 
The human sat in the fog, waiting for it to dear. 
From then on, on certain mornings, fog would appear.
There once was a giant who loved to eat humans, 
especially their hearts. The people ate nothing 
but what they caught from the sea, and thought 
this giant was lazy, roaming the snow 
for such small food. After too many were killed, 
and the people feared soon none of them would be left, 
one smart man devised a way to murder the beast. 
He played dead on the giant's trail, and the giant 
tossed him over his shoulder, humming in anticipation 
of a good meal. The man let his head and arms drop, 
careful not to say ouch when he repeatedly bumped 
against the giant's back. He was tossed on the floor 
of the giant's hut, while the monster left 
to get firewood to roast him. The monster's son, 
smaller by comparison, came in. The man 
held the giant's heavy skinning knife to the son's throat, 
saying, "Quick, tell me. Where is your father's heart?" 
The anatomy of any giant is tricky -- brains sometimes 
in the belly, a stomach in an inner ear. "My father's heart 
is in his left heel," confessed the giant's son, whose own heart 
may have been in his upper arm. When the giant 
bounded through the door, the man was quick to stab him 
in his foot. The giant let out a thunderous cry, 
then fell over. He said, "Though I am dead, 
I'm going to keep on eating you and all other humans forever!" 
The man cut the giant's body into pieces and tossed them, one 
by one, into a fire he made with the wood 
the giant had gathered. When the man threw the ashes 
into the wind, each fleck transformed into a mosquito. 
From the middle of a buzzing cloud, the man could hear 
the giant's voice, "I'll eat your people until the end of time." 
The man felt a sting, then another, as though his whole body 
was a huge lip being pierced with women's jewelry, with labrets.
These tribes of men were never seen, 
except for their footprints and shadows, 
except for their snow huts and weapons. 
Seeing that there were no invisible women, 
these imperceptible men courted humans. 
Invisible men were said to be among the most handsome, 
but women could not be sure who they married 
until the unseen spouses died 
and then their faces became apparent. 
One human woman was so curious, 
she often stared into her invisible husband's shadow 
trying to guess the shape of his chin. 
When she held his body against hers at night, 
she memorized his outline. She tried to fill 
everything else in the next day when he was out hunting. 
She imagined the shapes of his hot breath in cold air 
were keys to the details of chest. 
She noticed the nuances of skin color among the villagers 
and tried to approximate his. When they kissed, 
she paid tribute to his invisible nose's width. 
One day when she could stand it no longer 
she stabbed a knife into the space 
where her husband was sleeping. 
His feet appeared first, then his legs, 
his torso, his arms, and finally his face 
which was more angelic than any wife 
could have imagined. Outside the hut 
bows were seen moving through the air 
as the other invisible men craved revenge. 
Because of their code of honor, invisible men 
could not aim arrows at those who could not see them. 
So instead they wailed along with the wife, 
voices even more invisible than usual, 
sobbing their disembodied grief.
The land of Island Ice was forbidden, 
yet three men journeyed there to hunt reindeer. 
So plentiful were the animals, these men 
built a little igloo and decided to stay for a visit. 
As they were sleeping the old spirit 
Aukjuk, the stealer of entrails, 
passed directly through their temporary ice wall. 
Dish in hand, she walked up to the first man 
and sucked out his entrails without waking him. 
She emptied the second and third hunter 
and left carrying her laden dish. 
The men were so light now, they rose to the sky 
and stopped at the moon. Even the powerful Moon Man 
was no match for Aukjuk. He sent the hollow men 
back to earth, to their wives 
who had to tie their husbands 
to their sleeping cots 
so they wouldn't float away.
A man can wander out by himself, 
far away from the others and, if he has 
enough room, grow into a giant. 
Dwarfs live in crowded places 
making tools so small human hands fumble 
when they try to use them. 
Then there are the half-people, 
those with whole heads and whole genitals, 
but with only one leg and one arm. 
They hop around, longing for the twins 
of themselves. They hop around like stripes 
peeled from the hides of majestic animals.
Back then, there was a mouse so big 
that when he stretched his morning stretch 
he was sure he touched the sky. It was soft and cool 
under his paws, not scratchy like his nest. 
He nibbled on his frozen fish and wished 
himself a better life. He wanted fame 
more than any other mouse. 
He constantly tried to prove himself. 
He swam the biggest lake, which took a whole day. 
But the other mice only laughed, pointing out 
the lake was a mere sloshy human footprint. 
It took him weeks to move a mountain 
that turned out to be just a rock 
that was only a few times larger than a pebble. 
Back then, mice as well as people said 
the sky was held up by a pole, like a table leg 
or an umbrella handle. The mouse thought 
he could shake things up, 
become the greatest mouse, 
by cutting down the pole and letting the sky drop 
on Kotzebue. Everyone would have to 
notice him then. So he chewed and chewed 
at the pole until his whiskers turned gray 
and his belly hung into the snow 
and finally one day the pole started to sway. 
The mouse pushed it and ran 
in the opposite direction. He lifted his paws 
over his head, ready for toppling clouds 
and stars. But nothing happened. 
On the ground all he saw was a leaf. 
He scampered along the length of the pole 
and found it nothing but a tree. 
So no one ever thought this mouse the greatest. 
He died in his sleep, obscure and nameless.
The shaman was not only murdered, but humiliated. 
Alluk cut off the tips of the shaman's fingers 
and took out his bladder and pitt it over his head like a cap. 
This happened on the mainland, before Alluk fled to King Island 
where he dressed like a woman, hiding from the shaman's friends. 
The shaman's spirit couldn't rest, with the thought of Alluk's spears 
right through him. The shaman tried to stay alive 
as long as possible and even had a pipe, the smoke coming out 
of his stab wounds. But soon even the shaman had to give in to death, 
though he did not travel all the way to that other world. 
Instead, he hovered above land until he found Alluk 
on King Island. His neighbors had not known his identity, 
knew nothing about his murdering a shaman. So they were surprised 
when they found Alluk tied up in a ball 
with stiff dry ropes no one could untangle. 
Alluk wept and called for his mother and father, 
anyone who could help him. And the shaman 
had his revenge -- Alluk curled up like a child in his death womb.
The glutton loved to eat so much 
that his huge belly was becoming a hindrance. 
He tried to tighten it with thongs 
so it wouldn't drag behind him, 
but the belly fat always found a way to pop out. 
He tried to stick his stomach in a hole in the ground. 
He tried to pack it in a snow drift before he left for a hunt. 
The smart belly always followed him, 
an embarrassment. It was time for magic. 
He commanded a mountain to be his new belly. 
He walked away unencumbered, proud 
that he had the biggest detachable stomach of all 
where he could store all that more food. 
Maybe the mountain started to feel resentful. 
Maybe it was a coincidence, an act of nature 
that, one day on his way to see how his stomach was doing, 
the glutton was killed by an avalanche.
The boy was eager to become a man, 
to please his grandmother who raised him. 
One day when the sea was calm, 
she asked him to walk along the beach 
to see if he was able to catch any fish. 
The boy walked in the wavelets, spotting 
first a tomcod. He grabbed it with two hands 
as the slippery fish danced in the air. 
The boy panicked -- he hadn't a sack 
in which to carry the fish. The tomcod 
didn't look as if it would stop wiggling 
any time soon. The resourceful boy 
made a decision, to swallow the fish 
whole and carry it home in his belly. 
He picked up a trout, a humpback, 
a whitefish and two salmon. 
Each left a ring of taste on the back of his throat. 
His belly began to bloat. Then he caught sight of a seal. 
He pulled off its whiskers before he swallowed. 
Then a beluga, a baby whale. 
Suddenly the boy's stomach was too big for walking. 
First, he tried lifting his gut and throwing it over his shoulder 
like a sack But soon his weight grew unbearable, 
especially after he stopped at a pond for a drink. 
The fish jerked back and forth, giving him cramps. 
The only way to go back was to follow the shoreline 
where his belly could float and bob in the sea. 
When he returned to his igloo he had grown too big 
to enter through the window or skylight. 
His grandmother used her magic 
to get him through a door. She sat him by the fire 
where a flying spark landed on his stomach. 
His skin was stretched so thin that this fiery ember burned right through 
and all the swallowed fish flew up and out with a gurgle. 
The grandmother laughed and thanked the gods, 
food for a whole winter swimming around her ankles.
Everyone knows shooting stars shoot nothing but shit. 
Yet Namik lacked all wisdom. 
He didn't wait for the star shower to stop 
before he began his hunt. The stars' droppings 
were like those of birds, except for their power -- 
The star shit turned Namik into grayish lichen forever. 
When igloos were alive 
and spun through the air, 
and snow burned in lamps 
because it could burn then, 
there was one more Eskimo word 
for snow. Snow in the air, 
drifting snow, snow on the ground, 
watery snow, newly fallen, 
drifted into house, suitable 
for building a house, crusty, 
hard, soft... There was a word then 
for snow that could burn. 
In this world of magic 
there was a girl who refused to marry -- 
her suitors good hunters, but dull. 
Her exasperated father finally married her 
to one of their dogs, and together 
they had ten children: two Eskimos; 
two dogs; two dogs 
with human heads; and four 
white boys. The white boys 
were warlike, biting her nipples 
as they nursed, crying through 
the night. The girl put her white children 
into the sole of a boot and set it adrift 
on the sea. The children were men 
by the time they reached white men's land 
where they settled down and produced 
all the white men now in the world.
White men aren't really white, 
if you consider snow as being white 
and the food in the sacks the white men hauled 
as being white. In Kivalina, white men 
abandoned a schooner. This is where 
the Inuits first found the flour 
which a widow first cooked with water and seal oil 
to feed her hungry children. 
The bread bubbled until it tanned 
like a white man, until it was as brown 
and delicious as her own hands.
Everyone makes too much of the moon. 
It is the same as here -- the same snow, 
the same animals. When it seems 
like there are too few caribou left 
I go to the moon to get a few more. 

Everyone makes too much of the sky. 
It's the same as here, tipped upside-down. 
When the wind blows it rustles the grass stems 
loosening snow which gives us snow storms. 
The lakes in the grass are our stars. 

The worst winters come when the giant up there 
needs another snow hut. The snow we get then 
are particles hurling from his shovel. 
He gets out of breath doing all that work. 
His huffing and puffing is the north wind.
Raven always takes credit for creation. 
But who knows for sure how he did it? 
Some say we all descend from the pea 
that Raven planted in sands of a barren beach. 
Imagine his surprise when a man 
split the door of his pod and walked out 
shading his eyes to the sun? 
Raven pushed up his beak 
like a baseball cap of his favorite team, 
and sure enough a human face lurked beneath. 
When three more pea-men rolled out of the pod, 
Raven decided to take them inland, 
leaving the first man on the coast. 
Others think this makes more sense -- 
that when Raven brought light to the world, 
a bladder parachuted down from the sky. 
Trapped inside were the first man and woman. 
They tore their way out and blew air into the bladder-aircraft 
until the first mountain popped up. 
The man scratched his head against the hills 
to create small animals. The woman urinated 
to produce the sea and spat 
to form rivers and lakes. A few say 
we were here all along, just underground -- 
our tunnel leading to the surface of the earth 
plugged up with a stick. When it finally cracked, 
men and women crawled out 
like so many curious slow-motion ants.

To a girl fourteen in 19 10, 
no doctor could prepare, nor father 
console. Her mother couldn't really 
speak to her from heaven. 
No choice but to believe 
the gentle, kindly men. 
"Lie down here. Breathe this." 
She woke to an absence 
ever after present. One breast 
growing on alone, into, she must 
have felt, no chance of marriage. 
How could she speak of this 
to any man? How could she not? 
God and her father would love her.
God and her father would love her 
but how could she unbraid their voices? 
Father, in the pulpit, all her life 
the voice of God. To picture 
God: a fearsome, loving father. 
Then, a third strand, too -- 
the voice of her desire, stronger, clear. 
When the letter came, "You are needed 
in Alaska." "Do you want to go?" 
the tangled voices stretched 
and all sang "Yes" together. 
Father said, remember, Jesus said 
"Lo, I am with you always, 
Even unto the end of the world."
"Even unto the end of the world" 
her father said, not knowing how close 
he was to death. When the letter 
came to her, by train, by boat, by dog-team, 
that first year, she sat alone, months 
since he was buried, she not knowing. 
Months before she knew her home 
was here, her love, her work. 
That world could have fractured then 
like spring ice, sent her floating 
off alone in freezing water, no land in sight. 
But people there were watchful, wanted her 
to stay. They reached, she held -- 
days, weeks, seasons, years.
Days, weeks, seasons, years of love and labor -- 
she remembered them to Maury, his love 
a gift she'd not had time to dream of. 
Out together, walking, taking pictures, 
a yellow flower would make her think of Shishmaref. 
"As soon as there were patches of dry ground 
we'd take our picnic out. One year, I made 
seventy-four doughnuts." Evenings, playing scrabble, 
she might put down "gangrene," tell about the man 
whose leg she'd saved, the beaded mukluks 
his wife made for her, to thank her. 
She'd show pictures. "This dog-team took us 
five hundred miles." "Seal-pokes store the frozen berries." 
Maury smiled, touched her shoulder. Oh, my.
She smiled and touched his shoulder. "Oh, Maury 
listen. My niece went to Shishmaref, They made 
this tape..." Organ music filled two rooms. 
In one, the harmony of someone cooking hotcakes, 
dogs outside, a baby. She knew this time of year 
that sea was freezing into silence, while here 
she heard its liquid rhythm all year round 
softly breaking at the edges of this room. 
Maury's room. She could use his tape recorder 
any time she liked. "Listen to him play that organ. 
He must be as old as we are. I taught him how, 
and think of that, he still remembers." 
"There is a green hill far away," she hummed along, 
climbing to the top and gazing out.
Climbing to the top and gazing out 
from the mission to the freighter 
coming in each year, she never knew 
what it would bring. She knew what she 
had ordered and she liked to see that, stacked 
against the winter. Then, as the ship went out 
she sorted through the unexpected gifts -- 
coats and sweaters, stuffed toys, mittens. 
Once a furnace for the orphanage, 
radiators, pipes, and all the fittings. 
Sometimes something odd, you wouldret know 
what it was for, but someone always 
found a use for everything. So much 
thought and human goodness, so much love.
She thought of all the love and human goodness 
and about the question someone asked, 
"Did you ever think you might be interfering, 
destroying what you didn't understand?" Yes, 
she wondered about that sometimes. 
You do what seems right, 
but you never know. Maybe it was like the doctors 
doing the best they could to save 
her life, so long ago. Today, they wouldn't 
do that, they know more. But life refuses 
to be diminished by our limitations. 
It takes whatever we can give 
and gives back more. To all of us, as 
to a girl fourteen in 1910.
When the old woman greets you, 
her eyes sparkle, but she hides 
her hands, dirty from digging. 
Asked what she's found, she'll show you: 
an ivory comb, a harpoon's point, 
a mastodon tooth. Not much, 
but you should see 
what her son's daughter found! 

Later, you do: the jade axe head, 
cool green weight, sharp edge, 
stories. Holding it 
for a moment as it is passed 
around the room, you are included.
When I was six years old 
this doll curved to fit my hand, 
a girl my age with black hair, 
red lips embroidered on soft leather. 
Her parka would come off, 
but I was careful. She 
had come so far to sleep 
with me, the soft fur 
around her face against my face.
Emma is washing her family's socks, 
stopping to hold the school teacher's baby. 
"This baby always want to be held," 
she tells me. As we look out her window 
at the boats, coming from hunting, fishing, 
her tears enter our silence. Her children 
come in and out from school, 
forgotten homework, money for pop. 

We talk. Her husband enters the room we are in 
without breaking it. He is carving 
a fish from the rib of a whale, 
looks up to make the baby smile, tells me 
what he can do: fix snowmachines -- 
"Somebody had to know, that first winter 
they came here, so I learned." 
and what he can't do: read, write. 
"You might not have learned 
to fix snowmachines if you could read, " I offer. 
"But it makes you feel bad." 

He talks of dreams for his children 
as if it's all one dream: 
"They should learn enough in school 
to be a secretary. We should all go back 
to Ikpek and start the village again." 
Emma dreams that Jesus is coming back. 
"Pretty soon now. So many people have died. 
It used to be TB. Now it's that cancer." 

The fish emerges 
from the bone: swimming 
tail curved, head raised, 
the weight a fish would be 
if it could be held 
in motion.
I am leaving, and want to take something with me. 
Herbert wants to give me more than money can buy, 
because my name is Helen Frost, and I remind him of her. 

While he sells shrewdly 
to someone else, he watches me 
with the other side of eyes trained to see 
what someone wants more than anything. 

I touch the smooth ivory seals and white bears, 
the rough bone sculptures of motion: 
Eskimo dancer, face to the sky, 
feet solid on frozen ground. 
I touch the smooth faces 
of women, their parkas, 
babies between fur and skin. 
I touch the babies' 
ivory noses. Herbert is watching. 

"I want to show you 
something they found in the digging." 

He opens a safe in the corner, 
finds something small, well-wrapped. 
Unwrapped, in my hand, it shines 
golden, unchipped, not the gold 
of today's sun, too brilliant 
to stare at -- a gently aged ivory. 
The image has no hands, no hair. 
She has two eyes, a mouth, 
the rounded form of a child 
soon to be born, to glow 
in its own time, in our time. 

"Did the person who found her polish her up?" 
"No. She came out of the ground like this. 

I go back, through the image, 
through my father's sister 
who lived in this place and was loved, 
through the people who loved her, the parents 
who loved them ... the old village glows, and dies. 

The sea threatens. 
Sand buries the village. 
Ice buries the sand. 
In another winter, 
in a distant place, 
the smooth carved woman 
comes out of the ground 
like this: 
                  Hold me, she says 
                  and you will be blessed.
It used to be your hands 
I'd think of when my body was alone 
at night, or in the middle of a meal, 
wanting you to taste the bread 
I'd kneaded, baked. The smell 
of baking bread has filled the house 

like another person's pillow. What house 
do you live in now? My hands 
are so far from knowing your smell 
I don't even know where you live, alone 
pretending you like to slice bread, 
some cheese, maybe a few potatoes, and call that a meal. 

There is no such thing as a meal 
when one person lives in a house. 
"Give us this day our daily bread," 
we prayed when I was a child, hands 
folded, heads bowed. And now, those words alone 
bring to this room that familiar smell: 

diapers, split pea soup, the smell 
of parents in love with each other, each meal 
a feast of joy. They were never alone. 
They could move ten kids from one house 
to another. We'd hold up two hands 
to strangers' questioning glances. A loaf of bread 
might last one meal -- oatmeal bread 
our grandmother baked. That smell 
filled her house when her hands 
looked too tired to lift a meal 
to her mouth. She stayed in her house 
till she died. I never thought she was alone. 

But perhaps she was. Maybe alone 
is something that happens like air fills bread, 
warm air that will rise to the roof of a house 
and then out, carrying all that smell 
of love, fear of death, plans for the next meal. 
All this has led me far from your hands. 

It is like this that living alone in the hands 
of circumstance has led, one meal at a time, one house 
to another, too far to return. You don't smell this bread.
On the lake a swan moves, brilliant, then hidden 
in shadows, trees hanging over the edge of the lake's only island. 
Three girls watch me watch the swan, 
hear how I call it "he." We see him swim alone, 
white on the wide, deep lake. 

Elizabeth, sick last year, now better, 
looks down at her shirt 
where two small nipples show. She wants to know 
"What if one side grows more than the other?" 
I tell her the other side may catch up and if not 
it won't matter so much when they're larger. 
My breasts, round but innocent still of the hunger 
infants cry out from, cannot quiet 
their own hunger for tiny mouths. 

Emma has never told me why she was sobbing 
alone in a corner that rain-driven day. Today she asks 
"How can you keep your life from going wrong?" 
and we talk of lives we know, gone somehow wrong. 
I hold her question as I could not hold her. "What's wrong 
can lead to what's right. What seems right 
sometimes goes wrong. Don't blame anyone. 
Let's go swimming." 
We stay close to shore, shade our eyes to look for the swan. 

Mary has been accused (more than once) of seeing too much. 
She looks at me, looks at the shores which outline this lake, 
asks "Could you swim from here to that island?" 
"It looks hard, but yes, I think so." 
Evening, we all look together across the dark water, 
no swan in sight. "Shall I try?" 
I ask, and the girls answer "Yes." 

I step to deep water, swim easily 
across moonlight, straight to the island, 
into shadows of fallen branches, living trees, 
shadows the swan has moved through. I touch 
stones at the island's edge, stand, wave to the girls 
who wave back. Moon sends her wide beam down 
through cold air between us. 

Swimming back, I see the girls point but can!t hear what they shout. 
I swim hard, they wave harder, so I turn and see 
the swan, black, move across white. Beak hard, 
wings folded, he makes and holds the distance he wants 
between us. I know the strength of his wings, 
powerful webs of his feet. I hear the girls shout -- 
when I turn, they are not where they should be -- no -- I am not 
where I should be. A current is pulling me, harder than I can swim. 

The girls start to sing. I hold their voices, 
swim backwards against the current, away from the swan, 
now white against dark, beautiful eyes, muscular neck. I pull 
underwater, glide without splashing, pull as hard as I can, harder. 
Elizabeth, Emma and Mary keep singing. 
Their song pulls me back, until I can hear each voice 
distinct, the trio together, fire behind them behind me. 
The swan turns and I step out of the water, 
receive from the girls a towel, a blanket, hot soup. 
We are quiet. The swan swims back to shadows. 

We sleep and wake, sun warms us. 
I walk alone along the shore. That current, 
where is its source? 
Here, a channel where it flows away. 
Tall grasses wave, I move among them. 
When I find it, I know I've been seeking 
these grasses, feathers, mud -- this tumultuous circle, 
wider one side to the other than my arms could reach. 

A swan swims up the channel. She 
steps into her nest, arranges 
her wings beside her, 
settles to warm her egg or eggs. 
I sit on a sun-warm rock, watch until he comes home. 

When I return, I tell the girls what I have seen. 
Elizabeth has slept all afternoon, woken clear. 
She cups the egg she hears in her two hands. 
Emma has walked around the lake, dragging back 
a log for firewood, and now she rests upon it. 
Mary looks wide at the water, 
sees the swan swim near, gathers him into our circle. 
"Look at our eyes." she says. "our eyes are different."
About fifty miles he took her, from home 
because he wanted a woman, and she was young, 
beautiful, strong. They walked this land 
across the low-slung mountains, the only horizon 
she knew, and on into the darkening 
weather. Further, further. She kept her eyes open, 
remembering the shape of every tree. 

While she was there with him, her daughter 
came to the world. But the woman did not like 
the man she was with. She set her eyes 
on the mountain she had to cross, started 
walking, child on her back. She knew the rivers, 
ponds, the tracks beside them. No people 
had built their houses along the way. 

She heard sticks breaking behind her, not 
the sound of a charging moose, not a circle of wolves, 
not a lynx nor a wolverine. Her husband's brother 
followed her like a dark cloud she couldn't 
outrun. He cut her head with his knife 
and she fell there. She didn't see or hear 
when he turned and left her bleeding.

It was springtime. The sound of crying attracts 
the hungry ones, just coming out of their dens. 
The child was hungry too. Her mother lay there, barely 
breathing, unable to feed or quiet her daughter. 
But the animals left them alone. She found herself 
living. She knew where she was and she knew 
the steps she must take to get home. 

The child carried a seed of her own 
daughter, the woman who speaks to us now, 
whose son, grandchildren, great-grandchildren 
listen and know by their listening, her grandmother 
had to survive. We want her to stand, 
take the steps she must take, and she takes them, 
alone, and she carries us, and we pull her along.
When she is taken from them, her family 
holds her, in mind, those seasons. 

Bitter winter, they dream her a caribou blanket, 
pray the animals take it to her. 

Springtime, they need fish, they travel 
the river channel, put out their nets. 

Steadfast, they leave a stick 
pointing the way they have gone. 

Each day and evening, their ears are open. 
Slap of a beaver. Splash, a fish jumps. 

It is evening. There is a fire, beaver tail crackling. 
Her brother hunts the river's edge 

for muskrat's soft ripple. Someone 
is crying in the woods. 

He tells the others. They cross the river. 
They bring her back. 

Someone is feeding the child. 
Someone is making a mild broth. 

Someone is warming water. 
The water is warm, to wash her hair. 

The water is reddish brown. 
She sleeps, she sleeps, they care for the child.
This field in summer had always been 
rich with blueberries, hands to pick them. 
On one side, the church, graves. 
On the other, wetland, cranes. 
Far off, not to be gazed at, not to be named, 
the mountain. 

Then airplanes came, needing a place to land. 

The Cat rolled round metal toes 
through forests of living trees, 
forests of burned trees, around swamp, 
around lakes. It came to the people, 
four houses and the church. Children 
ran to watch the Cat roll 
over and over the berries, over and over, 
so airplanes could land, 
between the church and its mountain. 

They did land. 
They do land. They bring 
flour, sugar, coffee, diapers, tea, 
school, radio, Pilot Bread, doctors, 
money, Spam, batteries, blankets, 
boots, guns, telephones, teachers, 
apples, lettuce, priests, propane, 
beer, whiskey, fur buyers, frying pans, 
cigarettes, Blazo, snowmachines, 
game warden, teakettles, parkas, 
mattresses, band-aids, tv., potatoes, 
shampoo, Oil of Olay. Almost daily now 
the airplanes land. We meet them. 

The church holds its ground. 
A splash of berries edges the runway. 
This earth has eyes.
You are cold at night, 
your blood not moving so fast. 
Who am I? Dropped out of the sky 
one day, not carried back, can't speak 
any words of your world. 

I give you my hot water bottle, 
small container of warmth 
I was too far away to give 
when my own grandmothers 
faded back into their beds. 
You have seen plenty 
to cause you to wonder 
where my grandparents are. 

You take my gift 
in both hands. 
You shake it. 
You smile. Our eyes meet, 
blue eggs, brown nest.
I was neither hunter nor his wife 
nor mother, child, cousin. 
But with them, learning 
quiet as I could, 
what every child on the river 
knows as deep as breathing. 

Where beaver keeps his winter food. 
Whose blood this is, otter or the fish he ate. 
How long ago these tracks were left, how large 
they were to start with, how they spread 
and lose their shape, but keep their rhythm. 
How our sleep and waking moves with theirs. 

I relaxed against the boat -- strength of metal 
at my back, motor and its gas, men 
to guide the boat, watching woods and water. 
With the women, but without a child, 
I could watch the sky, blue, 
cloudless over yellow trees.. 

One eagle, high, 
spiraling wide, 
closer. 
Wings. 
Feathers. 
Eyes. 

A sound beside me. My hand flew 
before I knew I heard. 
I hit the hunter's arm as my voice 
hit me. "That's a Bald Eagle!" 
Gunshot to the heart 
of all that seemed to hold me 

"Don't cry. It didn't fall down." 
Kindness, gentle teasing, faces without 
anger. I tried to find my place again. 
Motor working against water. 
Eagle soaring. Amanda needs her jacket zipped. 
Grandma's busy with the babies. 

Going home, we stopped to see the eagle's nest 
at the top of a tall, flat-topped spruce. 
The hunter lifted his hand 
skyward to his friend, a Golden Eagle. 
The day softened. Children gathered stones 
on the sandbar. Mothers watched for tracks. 

That evening, women in the steambath 
spoke in English, led me 
to understand he hadn't meant 
to kill it, just scare it away. 
Bones are found, under eagles' nests. 
Sheep, bigger than the children. 

They may have known how I would someday 
watch my baby sleep, arms spread, 
his crib an open sky. 
How I'd cover him, treasure the warmth 
of his heart beating 
in the heart of all that holds.
Now we see and hear daily 
what the empty winter skies 
were ready to receive. 
Dolmoya, Tugaga', Tomo. Their cries 
lift our eyes. Their necks 
stretch forward, wings 
push air towards us. We breathe 
the end of snow. 
That quiet glow of sun on the horizon 
which held us close, lifts 
higher and wider each day. We watch 
knowing the river 
will break and flow. 

The bird names mean goose, duck, and swan 
in Dinak'i, the Upper Kuskokwim Athabascan language.
When sun burns holes in snow 
around trees, around the church 
drops of red appear: 
cranberries in moss, 
left from fall, fermented. 
Easy food! A bird 
can eat too many, fly crazed, 
kill itself before its nest is finished.
Heart muscle 
Pumping 
Its knowledge 
To every cell 
Of our body 

The moose 
He shot, the meat 
He gave me 
Knowing 
My hunger 

That night, that moose 
Roaming 
My leg, the calf 
Of my leg, awake 
My right leg, the calf 
Of my right leg, an ache 

A humming, wind 
Around velvet, hanging 
From antlers 

Next day, the story: 
"We saw that moose running. 
My Dad shot it 
Right here." Hand
On the calf 
Of his right leg 

Three years later 
Three thousand 
Miles distant 
That wakening 
His wife, death 
Beside her 
Like a husband 
Here that morning 
Before I moved 
A muscle 

Hand to hand 
The news, the words 
"He burned up 
When his house 
Burned down." 

Towels, they need 
Blankets 
Comfort, heart 
To hand.
Somewhere a house is empty of these lives, 
the mother beaver dead, the pups not born. 
Our hands caress the loss. Our thought contrives 

to name the brown and violet parts, as if, in naming, it revives 
the heart, makes loops and curves and folds less torn. 
Somewhere a house is empty of these lives. 

We lift the liquid cradles, cut them loose with knives. 
Water breaks on fur, feet, tail. Watching, we forget to mourn. 
Our hands caress the loss. Our thought contrives 

their birth. We wrap the pups in plastic, hang them high in leaves 
of willows by the river, to protect their perfect form. 
Somewhere a house is empty of these lives. 

We clean the inside of the mother's skin. All we do deprives 
her house of mud, sticks, food -- leaves her mate forlorn. 
Our hands caress the loss. Our thought contrives 

to find an exit. The living beaver slaps his tail and dives. 
We are enclosed in widening rings of scorn. 
Somewhere a house is empty of these lives. 
Our hands caress the loss our thought contrives.
In order to choose, he has to know 
All the trees, their age and strength, 
How each wood will bend and float, each twist 
Of the Swift Fork of the Kuskokwim. 
He travels by boat to these trees, to this.
Pulling, pulling, arm's length to chest, 
Mosquito net over face, but not hands, 
He makes lumber, bone smooth, almost as white. 
Thin as a fingertip, wide as a thumb is long, 
Boards take their shape in summer's long light.
Canoe, man, paddle, need all their strength 
From winter to summer, home to home. 
Fish eggs splash from belly to belly there. 
Full of meat, dried salmon, whitefish, berries, 
It carries him back to winter like gliding on air.
Fireweed, grass, the edge of the bank --
"Look here --" Hand-polished wood of the bowpiece 
Arcs towards a tree standing vigil above like a widow. 
She seasons its grave with her roots, her seeds, 
While the river keeps on swallowing dirt below.
When the bank collapses, the frame 
Is freed of its weight, and rides 
The river, past where the man is buried, 
Past Medfra, McGrath, to Bethel, the sea. 
It meets itself gliding upriver with all it carried.
Log by log 
when people moved 
they moved the church 
downriver 
layer by layer 
log by log. 

Among the trees 
they built a replica 
to hold the sacred place. 
It stands, still, 
hidden, among the graves 
among the trees. 

Like a vein 
the river holds the moving 
between two places 
where spire, onion dome, and cross 
rise above the logs 
like a vein.
The eyes of the bird I buried 
look up from the dirt. 
The girls ran away because 
I buried the bird 
that way. 

At a wedding 
everyone smiles. My mother 
smiles at my brother. She smiles 
at his bride. But looking at me 
she can't seem to see me 
before what ever is wrong 
was wrong. She can't see 
a wife at my side. 

                       I bury 
the wings of the bird I held 
carefully, let its eyes 
stare at the sun. The girls, 
when I'm not there, 
bring each other to look 
at the thing I have done.
Yesterday, snow was coming down, big flakes, 
and you were writing "Love is like snow" 
how it comes down so soft, one day, 
but the next day it blocks you in, or it is gone. 
Some of you left it newfallen, tender, 
how it should be, I thought, sixth grade love should -- 
then I remembered sixth grade, how all the girls 
wanted a valentine from Steven. He gave us 
each one, and we compared them. Two sizes. 
Charmagne, of course, got a big one, mine was small, 
and when Jane said "Let's see 
your Valentine from Steven," I said "No."
Then, at the bottom of the pile, a big white envelope, 
my name, a second card from Steven Deane. 
He was watching me open it. We both knew 
I wasn't pretty, he should like Charmagne, would 
go on being her boyfriend. But there was 
that moment, and yes, it was something like snow. 
Its memory blesses me now like your poems, 
their honest endings, melting away to nothing, 
or turning -- Angie's puppy, to care for like love, 
Damon's "Love is like football. 
I hope I will have a 100 yard run."
There probably was no dead cow 
rotting in the cistern, or maybe 
a jumble of bones. Who 
could have put it there? 
Did it die first, or did they 
push it in alive, hear the echoes 
moo all day and night, 
quieter, quieter, silent? No -- 
edges too high, circle too small, 
no cow so stupid. Probably 
not even true, just wood 
scraps, that headless doll, 
the part of the broom you can't hang 
dresses on, the part of the Christmas tree 
that wouldn't fit. Probably 
no dead cow, no bones. 

But big kids told little kids. 

I half believed, then heartily 
told, until I more than half 
believed. And the telling 
kept the cover on, kept us 
alive to tell the tale.
Yes, I also feel we have already kissed, 
like we say our letters cross 
as if there is an intersection 
we don't know is there, until 
the evidence arrives for each hand to hold. 

Each afternoon before my father came home 
my mother changed her dress, touched her cheeks with rouge. 
Fingertip by fingertip, each little scalloped jar 
would last for months, window swinging open 
on its golden pin, each afternoon, year after year. 

Bouncing on their bed, I argued with my sisters -- 
whose turn to have the little butterfly, 
opening 
closing its wings; the monocle; 
the bed box-elder bugs could sleep in. 

Eyes on its center, I watched a speck of ivory widen 
widen each day until the rouge was an untouchable ring. 
There was a day I held it warm in my hand 
when he came home, when they embraced. That moment of their own 
we circled round but did not enter. 

Warm in my hand through all these years 
through these recent months 
thinking of you, towards 
this certainty I haven't known 
I carried with me.
Sunlight 
on your old green couch 
like summer's warmest grass 
                        "rest here" 

I slept 
and woke, and opened 
my eyes.        Across the room 
you opened yours.        Everything 
opened.            Children 
were there.       Good. 
                                    Sweet. 
                                                Easy.
Someone may chew on your joy 
like a slug on a daffodil, 
their hunger and weight 
bowing your head to the earth. 

When they have eaten their fill 
they will be where they want to be, 
won't have to back down your green stem 
the way they got up. Nourished, 
they'll slide off into the dirt, and you 
will lift your new lace to the sun.
Fever has made him transparent -- 
he sheds his layers of school, 
Cub Scouts, kids on the bus, 
and lies on the couch, hot to my touch, 
but "Mom, I'm so cold" under the quilt. 
The fire I make in the woodstove, he claims 
for his own, "You're making it just for me," 
and that seems to warm him. 

The window, the time to look through it, 
grace of the trees, snow weight on branches. 
Small red glow of a bird, settling 
flying, lending its weight to the changing 
colors of one, no two, sharp points 
of light in the snow, on the tree. 
"If you get right here, and look, you can see them." 

So I do, and I see. The air holds 
like that, all day, gathers inside 
when the curtains are closed. Supper 
seems to have some of that light 
shifting its colors between us. Mom, Dad, 
Brother, and Baby.   But something 
hotter than birds, heavy as snow, 
weights our branches   landing 
leaving   landing again. 

"If you two ever fight, don't just break apart." 
"We won't." "We won't."
"But Dad, you and my Mom. How 
did it happen before?" 
"We weren't right for each other. We were too different." 

"But me," he claims, looks to his brother, 
"and Glen -- we're just alike. If we were babies together 
you'd have to put arrows above us that say 'Lloyd' and'Glen.' 
We're not too different." 

No, we nod, yes 
you are right, you are not 
too different. And then 
just that moment, the light 
lifts the weight. We are all 
in flight, undulating 
from tree to sky.
Three times since your daughter was born 
you have welcomed your second child, 
only to grieve when the child turned back, 
while still your secret. Telephone cords 
have carried the weight of those years -- 
sister to mother, to sisters, brothers. 
And now, we've stopped asking. 
(Have we grown up, not to be trying 
to ferret out every secret like candy 
stashed in an underwear drawer?) 

Today, your family is visiting mine. 
We go for a walk, start remembering 
how we coaxed each other across 
that slippery log behind the blue house 
to get to the grassy place we'd take our dolls, 
balancing, too, their Sunkist orange box beds. 
I am careful not to mention real babies, 
though my son is not yet two. He walks 
eight blocks with us, and I admire (silently) 
his sturdy little legs. I speak of your five-year-old's 
beauty, as if perhaps you should be satisfied. 

Trying so hard not to say "baby," I hardly hear 
how you are naming every flower we see. "Peony" 
"Pansy" "Zinnia" "Iris." And then you pass your hand 
across the curve I haven't noticed in your faded sweatshirt. 
"Look at this." Your voice so quiet, the gesture 
born half-living.     I look. 
Then, startled, look again: 

Four years ago, my first Alaskan winter, I skied 
three hours one afternoon, through ragged birch 
and gray-green spruce, the ground a messy confusion -- 
rabbits' tracks on top of squirrels'on top of snowmachines'. 
The sky was gray with waiting, and I longed for home, 
or summer, or the brush of a ptarmigan's wing on clean snow. 

I skied back to all the home I had. 
Snow on the roofs of houses, nine 
houses made of weather-colored logs, 
the same dulled yellow as the circles 
marking the lengths of dogs' chains, 
dogs the color of dirty snow. 

And then blue. 
Truly I saw blue that day, 
curling its way into the heavy sky. 
I stopped to stare and I saw 
steam, rising from a steambath. 
The steam was blue. 

Now, as you speak, our walk brings us home. 
Glen tugs at my legs, and I lift him, 
my sky today so clear, expansive. 
You say you can't hope, you just can't, 
but I tell you: 
the tapestry your grief has spread 
can be what lets you see 
this child. Tiny ears, 
even now, are curling around our words.
Sand and water mixed and sucked 
our boots like mouths. The children 
touched anemones, for that same pleasure, 
something sucking, sweet, the little kiss 
it makes when we pull free. 

I was showing that to Glen, "Look -- 
it's like a small green rock. But if you watch 
awhile, it starts to wave its arms. It's o.k. 
to reach in and touch it." 
                                        Just that long, 
the time it takes to say that, I'd turned 
from my sister, her son on her hip, 
then turned again when she said, "Helen, 
take Paul." Quietly, like Mom might 
take a hotdish from the oven, "Put this 
on the table. Be careful. It's hot." 
"Be careful," she was saying as I turned 
away from my child, to reach for hers, held 
up from sand and water, sucking 
to her knees, her thighs, her hips. 
"It happened so fast, " we'd say later, over 
and over, safe inside all the "what ifs." 
Her husband (barely within earshot) 
couldn't pull her out, but could 
plant his legs, hard, on firm ground 
so she could pull herself. 

That's what she did. We didn't tremble 
until after she had showered. We held our tea, 
watched through a window as the tide came in, 
the child in her lap repeating, 
"Mommy. Dirt. Coat."
His voice was in my hair, his legs 
tight around my waist. 
His hands a knot 
behind my neck, his eyes 
closed, in my hair. My eyes 
were open, my ears 
open wide: Something was coming. 
Bigger than people. Noisy. 

It didn't knock us down. 
It turned away. But turned again 
and, noisy, came towards us. 
I kept saying It's o.k."
I keep saying It's o.k." Eyes 
open, ears -- open wide. 
Bigger than people. Noisy. 
It doesn't knock us down. It turns 
away. Turns again, keeps on 
coming towards us.
Weeks ago, her deer-smell left her body, 
left her skin torn open 
weighted by her bones. Four legs leap. 
Two legs cannot follow. Barbs, 
wire she barely sees, catch her hair, slice 
her skin, hold her in her struggle. 

If we had seen her then, no struggle 
of our own could have heaved her body 
back into the snow it came from. Each slice 
already deep into her belly, open. 
Her blood mixing with blood barbs 
would draw from our hands, lifting to her leap. 

We didn't see her, didn't reach to give that leap 
its extra muscle, extra inches. Your struggle 
heavy one, belongs to you. But these barbs 
were placed here, by someone paid to place them. The body 
of the thought that holds her open 
says "It's my land. I bought it. I can slice 

it through with fences anywhere I care to slice. 
If deer, or anyone, can leap 
my fence, I'll build it higher." We open 
our eyes to the length of that fence, struggle 
to remember the stretch of this land's body 
before any wires tautened their barbs 

across it. Like an alphabet, this strand of barbs 
leads to the mountains, offers us a slice 
of what we wanted whole...Sangre de Cristo..."The body 
of Christ, given for you. The blood of Christ..."The leap 
of light that makes these hills his blood. Struggle 
coloring the deer. We see her open 

heart offering this earth blood for its open 
wounds, holes drilled for posts to hold the barbs. 
Her gift is in her struggle 
not to give it. We stare at the slice 
her blood's warmth cut through snow below her leap 
from her dying to the living body, 

Earth. I pull my open jacket closed around my body, 
follow these barbs away from the deer's leap, 
struggle, with my brother, home, slice by slice.
                              The last days with my father, like the first 
                              days with my son, held us who labored 
                              towards them in tenderness in tenderness. 

Deer came to the salt my father had set out, 
licked it and looked toward the window 
where he sat, looking too. Chickadees and finches ate their seeds. 

                                   That first night, his hair 
                                   smelled of cinnamon. Is this the scent 
                                   of the inside of my body? 

Two owls came. One in the pinyon pine, 
one on the roof. My mother heard its voice, 
saw its shadow on the roofline, on the snow. 

                                   Would I love my stepson less 
                                   than the baby? The birth 
                                   gathered us all into a circle. 

My sister flew out the day I arrived. 
When I left, my brother stayed. We saw 
bobcat tracks outside the house. 

                                   I tried to step out of my dreams 
                                   at the first small cry, to let my husband sleep. 
                                   I slept during the daytime, with the baby. 

His hands were warm. They felt strong 
even when his strength was almost gone. 
His eyes were full of love and jokes and sorrow. 

                               While I fed him, the aurora crossed the sky, 
                               green, red, silver, white curtains shimmering, leaving 
                               the sky dark, above snow. 

When he said goodbye, he stroked my hair. 
His heart was beating, he was breathing. He stroked my hands. 
I probably won't see you again." 

                              At first, he cried a lot. One book said, "Maybe 
                              they're just sad to be here." Then he got interested. 
                              Little fingers tangling in our hair. A smile.
Because a man has finished, we gather to scatter 
his ashes and the small chunks fire could not return 
to ashes. A breeze lifts a strand of his wife's white hair 
lets it fall to her cheek as her hand lifts and lets fall 
grey streaks of what was her husband. 

One fragment settles beside a saguaro. Rib? 
Finger? Knee? A light brown mouse, unafraid, 
approaches, finds, in the small bone, food -- white dust 
it gnaws and swallows. Leaving tooth-tracks, 
it goes home, we suppose, as we go home. 

We eat together, sit outdoors as evening darkens. 
An owl swoops, and when we see it rise, 
we hear short, then longer trills duet 
across the desert. The owl we see carries -- a mouse? 
The mouse we saw? To its nest? To its young?
Seventeen miles downriver, no phone, I said, "I wonder 
how you found out what happened. Radio?" "No," 
he answered, "Black Bear told us." And to the question 
in my glance, he added, "Came right up to the house. 
Dad had to shoot it. And that same day a tree 
fell down, just like someone shot it, right across the river." 

So, when a tree falls down across our driveway, river 
stories, that and others, come all day. I wonder 
if Aunt Helen might be leaving us. Could a tree 
here in Fairbanks speak to trees in California? No, 
I tell myself, until the phone call fills the house. 
"She died this morning, quiet, as she slept." Each question 

opening, gathers to a larger question. 
Not just like a raindrop finds a river, 
finds the sea, becomes the water in this house, 
blood in our bodies -- actual water in the actual wonder. 
Wood, skin, thought, all made of water, and no 
boundaries hold. We cut, for firewood, the fallen birch tree. 

Chopping, in fury, the base of a spruce tree 
squirrels climb -- to hole, to rafters -- no question 
of "who was here first," no 
thought of the river 
of knowledge between us, no wonder -- 
This is our house! 

But that night, dreaming, deep in the house, 
brown bear, open-mouthed growl, beside the tree, 
sends me out, early morning, in wonder 
to speak words of healing, to question 
the tree, to hear how my roaring river 
of anger rushed through it. There are no 

squirrels. Not in the tree, on the roof, no 
sound of squirrels anywhere. The house 
and all around it is silent. As if a river 
had stopped its motion. This tree 
has taken the blows of my axe, each question 
I didn't stop to think. It holds them. I wonder. 

I wonder if all the squirrels are forever gone.          No. 
Three weeks later, like the best question, they're back. The house 
is quiet; the tree is alive, holding its voices, its river.
Because he gave me his immigrant tenacity to seek justice and live for poetry, this book is dedicated to la memoria di mio padre, Donato Gioseffi, nato nel 1906, Orta Nova, Provincia di Puglia, Italia, who died, 1981, in America. He ventured through Isola delle lacrime, "The Island of Tears" [Ellis Island] in 1913, with his mother Lucia La Rosa of Naples, surviving a miserable, but hopefilled, journey across the Atlantic on The USS Independence. Though disabled, sickly and poor, he shined shoes and sold newspapers to work his way through degrees from Union College and Columbia University. He was among the first Italian immigrants to achieve honors, a Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Psi, in the Liberal Arts and Sciences from such societies. Though he spoke no English upon his arrival in the U.S., and was taunted as a "guinea gimp" by his American schoolmates, he was proud of his U.S. Citizenship, achieved in his twenties, and read to me through my youth from Dante, Rabelais, Cervantes and Shakespeare in perfect English, though he also spoke Italian fluently, making me proud of his first homeland. His final words were quoted from Prospero's in "The Tempest": "The rarer action is in virtue than in vengeance," giving me an aesthetic ideal for action as his ul- timate philosophy. This paragraph is offered as a tribute to all who share the memory of their immigrant or enslaved parents' struggle in America. 

These poems are dedicated to my artist daughter, Thea Rinaldi Kearney, and my husband, Lionel B. Luttinger, with thanks for their supportiveness. And, it is dedicated to my five step children, especially Nina, and to all young people everywhere who keep a planetary conscience blooming in the light -- as non-violent activists like Grace Paley, Maya Angelou, Helen Caldicott, Judy Bari, Petra Kelly, Eleanor Roosevelt, Jane Addams, Emily Green Balch, W.E.B. DuBois, Lucretia Mott, Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, Nelson Mandela, Linus Pauling, Leo Tolstoy, Mahatma Gandhi, Chi'u Chin, Vittoria Colonna, Enhueduanna, and so many other true heroes and heroines of the worldwide, green peace movement inspire us and show us the way through the night to a new day in which, even so, "we shall overcome." Cynical sorrow gives no light to action and sheds no beauty in its wake, my father would say. But, sorrow wedded deeply to a love as beauty, makes human miracles happen everyday.

"The bloody massacre in Bangladesh quickly covered over the memory of the Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia, the assassination of Allende drowned out the groans of Bangladesh, the war in the Sinai Desert made People forget Allende, the Cambodian massacre made people forget Sinai, and so on and so forth until ultimately everyone lets everything be forgotten." 
-Milan Kundera, The Book of Laughter and Forgetting 
I was born in 1941. The sky was falling. 
The chairs of state 
were arranging themselves in "isms" of death. 
I learned to speak by fingering an apple, 
rolling its crimson shine around in baby fingers, 
because my mother's Slavic smile seemed to 
give it onto the table of my highchair 
in that Newark kitchen of new wintry mornings, 
bright leaves at frosty windows just met 
for the first time: autumn sun -- 
light, warm hands. "God bless Mommy! 
God bless Daddy! God bless spaghetti!"
I chortled up to the big people 
around my bedtime crib. When they laughed 
I learned I had a pen for a tongue 
that could please them. 

Meantime, the bombs were falling, 
the blitz began blitzing, Jewish, Polish flesh 
sizzled in Hitler's ovens, lampshades of human skin, 
gold fillings pulled from dead mouths 
remade into wedding rings. 
Are you wearing one? Has your gold 
ring come from a mother's mouth 
opened in mortified howl filled with poison gas 
in the stifling chamber where she bled 
menstrual blood down her thighs bereft of clothes, 
crushing her child to her crowded breasts. 

"Empathy" is my favorite word. 
My peasant mother -- war orphaned, 
my lame Italian immigrant father, 
"greenhorn guinea" they called him. "Guinea gimp!"
they shouted as he sold newspapers 
for the state "Education of the Poet"
he gave to me, raising me in the ghetto of Newark 
to speak good English where the worse that happened then 
was when a boy named Herby chased me, cornering me 
down the alley and kissed me, 
sticking his tongue in my mouth, 
choking me with mysterious sex as the other kids laughed: 
"Herby French-kissed Daniela!" A grand joke 
of the neighborhood. Nothing much else happened 
until I was abused by a Klansman in a dark jail cell 
one midnight, Sheriff of Montgomery County, 
the only law for miles around Selma where 
I integrated Deep South television as a journalist 
announcing Freedom Rides and Sit-ins, 
not out of bravery, but idealistic naivete. 

Somewhere in between then and then, 
I met a book full of rotting corpses, 
photos of mutilated bodies on battlefields 
or in concentration camps, dead faces distorted by screams, 
dying hearts impaled on bayonets, and all my orgasms, 
ever since have been screams of letting go of horrors 
-- guilty gaping skulls full of gold filled teeth. 
I'm a "Jersey girl" who grew up, part Polish war orphan, 
part Jew, half Italian immigrant 
daughter of a lame "guinea gimp," who was a poet dying 
of the word, "empathy," he carried on his back 
and taught me Shakespeare's English. 
He said I was too pretty for my own good 
and read me Yeat's poem to his daughter, 
but now I'm fifty-three, menopausal, insomniac, 
and don't care much about looks. My greatest moment 
of joy came in near death -- not when I was jailed 
by the Klansman Sheriff, but when I gave birth 
to my daughter who came by emergency Caesarean, 
bright with hope, lovely girl, 
do you feel the ambulance siren of guilt, 
grieving in your near death birth, the re- 
birth of your mother and your moment of almost not 
being new life greeting me in your eyes, my eyes 
peering back at me, questioning, after the fever subdued. 
Here's your crimson apple of being, daughter, 
amidst new wars and books always repeating themselves 
like autumn where death turns to beauty in dying leaves 
singing their windy sighs 
into the lies of hypocritical 
histories of hand on reborn hand by hand murdered 
and bleached to bones 
or held warm or cold at fifty-three I can't sleep 
well anymore. I grow fat eating love, I remember thrills 
of my childhood autumns when the maples sang with sparrows 
outside fall windows and the kitchen was warm as apples 
turned crimson in pale hands -- color of blood simply 
being before I found the book of corpses 
from ovens, battlefields, slave ships, 
the ring of gold that broke in divorce 
from your father whom I still love 
and mourn. Now, I take you, daughter, 
to the woods to meet the scarlet maples, 
feed the wild deer, crush the leaves 
and acorns with your steps, dance 
in the moonlight, your mother is no orphan, 
like hers was, your father is not lame like mine was, 
but the Earth, Our Mother, 
and all Her creatures swirl in clouds of gas, garbage, greed 
the language of oppression: "nigger, pollack, guinea, mick, 
kike, jap, kraut, wasp, spick."

Washington confronted its manufactured "Butcher of Baghdad" 
and "sand niggers" were decried on Wall Street 
where the banks collapsed in graft. 
A tenuous thread of life secretes onto the page thickens 
my eyes become someone else's. Are they yours, Daughter? 
I collect a book on ethno-centricism, chemical, 
biological, nuclear warfare and hate 
the rich nuclear and oil barons who are your enemy. 
We cannot live without enemies, Freud said, 
but, these oil, nuclear, chemical, and germ warfare 
profiteers hold us all hostage, you, me, and them, 
to the screams of skulls with their forever gold 
teeth, lampshades of human skin, their ears are ours 
filled with a siren of guilt 
from the history book of corpses, daughter. 
It talks to autunm. It says: "Empathize!"
Because we all die to live 
and eat and see and hold our crimson apple. 

Its beauty makes us sing.
On the crowded subway, 
riding to the prison to teach 
Black and Puerto Rican inmates how to write, 
I think of the fable of the shoemaker 
who struggles to make shoes for the oppressed 
while his own go barefoot over the stones. 

I remember Grandma Lucia, her olive face 
wrinkled with resignation, 
content just to survive 
after giving birth to twenty children, 
without orgasmic pleasures or anesthesia. 
Grandpa Galileo, immigrant adventurer, 
who brought his family 
steerage passage to the New World; 
his shoemaker shop where he labored 
over American factory goods 
that made his artisan's craft a useless 
anachronism; his Code of Honor 
which forced him to starve 
accepting not a cent of welfare 
from anyone but his sons; 
his ironic "Code of Honor" 
which condoned jealous rages of wife-beating; 
Aunt Elisabetta, Aunt Maria Domenica, Aunt Raffaella, 
Aunt Elena, grown women huddled like girls 
in their bedroom in Newark, talking in whispers, 
not daring to smoke their American cigarettes 
in front of Pa;
the backyard shrine of the virgin, 
somber blue-robed woman, 
devoid of sexual passions, 
to whom Aunt Elisabetta prayed 
daily before dying in childbirth, 
trying to have "a son"
against doctor's orders, though 
she had five healthy daughters already; 
Dr. Giuseppe Ferrara, purple heart veteran 
of World War II, told he couldn't have a residency 
in a big New York hospital because of his Italian 
name; the Mafia jokes, the epithets: 
"Wop, guinea, dago, grease-ball."
And the stories told by Papa 
of Dante, Galileo, Da Vinci, Marconi, Fermi, Caruso 
that stung me with pride for Italian men;
how I was discouraged from school, 
told a woman meant for cooking and bearing 
doesn't need education. 

I remember 
Grandma 
got out of bed 
in the middle of the night 
to fetch her husband a glass of water 
the day she died, 
her body wearied 
from giving and giving and giving 
food and birth.
You died in spring, father, and now the autumn dies. 
Bright with ripe youth, dulled by time, 
plums of feeling leaked red juices- from your eyes, 
pools of blood hemorrhaged in your quivering mind. 
At forty, I cliunb Point Pinnacle, today, 
thinking of you gone forever from me. 
In this russet November woods of Millay, 
I wear your old hat, Dear Italian patriarch, to see 
if I can think you out of your American grave 
to sing your unwritten song with me. 
Your poetry, love's value, I carry with your spirit. 
I take off your old black hat and sniff at it 
to smell the still living vapor of your sweat. 

You worked too hard, an oldest child of too many, 
a lame thin boy in ragged knickers, you limped 
all through the 1920s up city steps, door to door 
with your loads of night and daily newspapers, each worth 
a cheap labored penny of your family's keep. 
You wore your heart and soles sore. At forty, 
not climbing auturnn hills like me, you lay with lung disease 
strapped down with pain and morphine, hearing your breath 
rattle in your throat like keys at the gates of hell. 
Your body was always a fiend perplexing your masculine will. 
You filled me with pride and immigrant tenacity. Slave 
to filial duty, weaver of all our dreams, you couldn't be free 
to sing. So be it. You are done, unfulfilled by song except in me. 
If your dreams are mine, live again, breathe in me and be. 

You never understood America's scheme. 
Your wounded dream, father,
will never heal in me, your spirit mourns forever 
from my breath, aches with childhood memory, 
sighs for my own mortality in you, 
which I, at last accept 
more completely than ever when we 
laughed together and seemed we'd go on forever -- 
even though we always knew 
you would die much sooner than I 
who am your spirit come from you. 
Remember, "a father lost, lost his!" you told us, 
preparing us with Shakespearean quotation 
and operatic feeling for your inevitable death. 

Good night, go gently, tired immigrant father 
full of pride and propriety. We, your 
three daughters, all grew 
to be healthier, stronger, more American than you. 
Sensitive father, I offer you this toast, 
no empty boast, "I've never known a man braver!" 
The wound that will not heal in me 
is the ache of dead beauty. 
Once full of history, philosophy, poetry, 
physics, astronomy, your bright, high flying psyche 
is now dispersed, set free from your tormented body, 
but the theme you offered, often forlorn, 
sheer luminescent soul, glistened with enough light 
to carry us all full grown.
Guilt is a gift that is given 
to love, a wound in the heart 
that says there is duty, 
the message in the blood of family, 
as to the father and mother 
of duty is born the child of duty 
and to the sisters and brothers 
their name together 
shared in home, 
a place the spirit retreats to 
when the world is cold and dark 
and hunger stalks the woods. 

Blood is thick and red 
and should not spill like water 
on silent rock. 
My blood is given to the trees 
as I fall on my knees, alone, 
to you, father, who taught me filial duty, 
and all your kin have forsaken me 
Like you, I am Lear, alone on the heath 
with only one Cordelia, 
the one you said I resembled, 
and I've been given one daughter 
who carries your blood, but not your name 
which I've given the fame of duty.
wears a black leather jacket full of safety pins and leans 
on crutches. Her legs are mangled and her friend 
looks anorexic: in black tights which show her thin legs. 
Both have beautiful faces, lost looks, eyes sunken in. 
They seem like runaways and disembark the subways 
at notorious 42nd Street where pimps and dens of inequity 
have reigned through the century 
of whores and drug dealers dressed like rock stars 
of heavy metal bands. "Bad Brains, Circle Jerks, Jonny Rotten,"
who was, and murdered his girlfriend. 

Up and down the halls of the colleges, I hear 
the children "Mother F-ing'" this and that 
as they go cursing everything up and down 
the escalators and elevators and back again. 
In bus terminals and in trains, leather-jacketed kids 
pretend to be tough, their green, purple, blue dyed 
hair, depressed faces, hollow stare. 

One girl's legs seem gnarled with birth defects, 
the other's are too thin to stand on. 
You've seen them, too, and worried about them as I do, 
as you fret over the global heat trap, ozone layer, 
nuclear waste dumps, biological warfare tests, 
Savings and Loan scandals, 
dying economy, polluted land and groundwaters, crack 
in the ghettos and cocaine on Wall Street, death squads 
in El Salvador, Haiti, Bosnia, rape and rising taxes, 
unemployment up with your job down on the line, crumbling 
roads and subways, falling bridges, plutonium 
shot into space on rockets! And so you let them go, 
let them pass away from you as I do, 
knowing they won't make it far into old age 
like me at fifty-three worried about my heart 
and high cholesterol. knowing mv grandchildren, 
if I have them, may be as doomed as these lost, 
vulnerable, tough, black leather-jacketed children 
full of safety pins, purple haired and anorexic. I remember 
how hard my immigrant father worked 
to take himself out of rags 
and see how hard these kids work to wear them. 

Caught in my throat, 
I feel their anger 
sharp 
as a starved 
shin bone.
is neatly dressed in slacks 
and clearly Black, 
strong legged and a little fat. 
On her right arm an old grey woman leans pale 
and small and frail, bird boned, clearly white 
and Jewish. They are on their way 
to the country house of the stroke victim's son, 
no doubt. The old able-bodied Black woman 
is a practical nurse, I surmise from her blank 
but steady eyes, now the daily mate, 
constant companion of an older white woman. They 
are more together, day 
in and out, than all 
their children, husbands or friends. 
You might say they are married and walk 
like a bride and groom through the gloom 
of the Port Authority Bus Station. 
The work of the Black nurse comforts and frees 
the children of the stroke victim, but leaves 
the children she feeds 
alone. Who will walk with her when she's old, 
and will she manage to grow old 
enough to need a nurse 
or afford one?
Takes my ticket with his missing thumb, just enough 
of a stub remains to rest 
the small card in the crease 
where his thumb should fold into his hand. 

I think of my nephew with his hand caught 
in an antique car fan, four fingers severed 
and sewn on again, stiff forever. And old Uncle Joe 
who survived the Battle of the Bulge
in World War II, only to have his fingers crushed 
in an assembly line when he placed an aluminum sheet 
inside a machine that pressed it into pie plates. How his face 
must have paled at the sight of his fingers 
mashed to bloody pulp. 
He never really smiled again, and went on to marry a cruel 
and homely woman who gave him one good son 
and more misery after that. 
We never really knew if World War II or pies brought his demise. 

I have a friend who is blind since birth 
and walks and rides the subway to work 
everyday in New York City. No "seeing eye" dog, 
just her white cane leads her way. 
And we who see are afraid of what lurks in dark alleys. 

I remember the tale of a magician told by a gnomish Irish wit, 
about a trickster who performed slight of hand wonders 
with a missing index on his right hand 
never noticed by his audience 
thoroughly engrossed by his dextrous tricks. 

I remember my father, long dead, who 
with lame and shortened leg, learned to ride a bicycle, hop 
on a pogo stick, dance the Tango at Arthur Murray's Studio, 
like all of us, unwilling to be labeled 
as less than the best endurance of his test. 

The thumbless bus driver's lost finger shows 
like a wound in his eyes -- 
though he drives well and takes tickets with his missing 
thumb. How could he take them with his good left hand 
when the entrance to the bus is on his right?
looks as if she has been struck dumb. 
Being a Black woman in the South Bronx 
is difficult enough, 
but having a child like this! 
Still, she wheels 
him dutifully through the zoo 
in his chair, his long arms 
and full grown legs 
all askew, his head gently 
pillowed wobbling 
to one side 
his crippled hand 
bent to his cheek, 
dazed eyes stare 
at the trees above -- 
he does not speak 
or request ice cream, 
lollipops or views 
of the giraffe or lion, 
balloons or pizza. 
He requires only her patience, 
and her love dazes her 
as if she were numbed by his birth. 

Does she wonder why or has she stopped 
asking? I can see 
only patience in her eyes, 
the kind 
that crosses over despair 
to resignation 
and does not ask 
only bears 
"Why?"
Slow sensual openings happen in the concert hall, 
eyes, pupils, irises, lilies, leaves, heart valves, 
moist mouths, silk sleeves, flags, words unfurled 
and feelings far beyond their meanings 
as we listen and the blind soprano changes 
the pain of this dark terror, this inscrutable mystery 
we live into bright sound, sensed sublimity, 

Cantatas, concerti, canons, 
contain captured passions 
from centuries before, still sing: 
have pity human heart on human heart. 

Leaves absorb light, shed shades of green wonder, color, 
string, bow, dance, breath of the blind soprano's spirit 
heralded by comet, cello, violin, 
viola, big base viol, all played by women 
diaphanously clothed in pale flesh, yellow chiffon frills, 
she fingers Braille notes, translates touch to sound 
notes from the dark chambers in her head, echoing 
harmony spreads smiles on the blind soprano's lips, sonorous 
sound swells triumphant in the loss of sight; 
her trills thrill tears, awe from my eyes over-full 
with seeing as I feel 
your dear hand dance 
rhythmic touch on my shoulder.
She sings her heart out with a smile 
like Louis Armstrong on the subway's dusty platform 
with her band, a bass, guitar, horn player, 
and drummer. She keeps singing with a smile 
even as an old demented man dances up and down, 
keeping rhythm in front of her, blocking the audience view, 
with his big rag of a coat, swollen leg and crutch. 
Undaunted, smiling even at the old beggar who steals her 
spotlight. "Music Under New York" says her sign, and she's among 
the good jazz musicians who play in the subways for quarters 
and dollars collected in a hat or instrument case open 
in front of them. 
Making music amidst the rumble of trains and rush of people 
who are made more cheerful by their tunes. 
Evelyn Blakey knows that the homeless man 
who dances on his crutch is comforted by her warble. 
"Georgia, Georgia...just an old sweet tune keeps Georgia 
on my mind..." he sings along with her, grinning soul, 
the sort of smile that says: "I've been 
through it all, but sing anyway." Evelyn Blakey, listens 
to the horn jam, listens to the drums roll, 
with ecstatic eyes closed, face full of music, 
and the old beggar dances on his swollen foot, 
his ragged coat swings back and forth with his tired bones, 
his grey head bobs in rhythm, 
and Evelyn, Evelyn, Evelyn Blakely sings, 
her heart full of sonorous sound, 
her foot tapping the ground, 
her subway commuters gather around.
From the stone towers of glass eyes, 
ears clogged with grey smoke, 
fingers numbed by the Atlantic's winter winds, 
we unhouse our homeless heads, under fierce 
skies, merciless sun. While political stooges 
ply your votes in our shadows 
pushing your hearts 
with the stigmata of promises 
to house or starve us, the untaxable throng 
who defecate on your doorsteps. 

You'd rather hear good jokes and happy tunes, 
and who can blame your rejecting 
our grubby faces or paws always there 
thrust out at your comfortable walk. 
You want to go gingerly as if 
we're barnacles on your pavement. 
We wait with tremulous breath 
at the end of your line. 
We stink up your conunute. 
The very rich never see us through the 
darkened windows of their limousines, 
sleek, dazzling, chauffeured, sipping cocktails 
on cellular phones. 

Only you, the workers of the city 
who rush to your unbearable jobs 
steam past us in guilt, 
an umbilicus connecting our lives to yours 
in ghastly communion 
that squeezes your breath. 
Our breath is already drawn 
like an over exposed x-ray. 
We take no bite of your body. 
We're too weak to steal your watch 
or briefcase. We live in bottles 
and broken boxes on subway grates 
and sleep sick to death in 
your dark doorways. 
We drink the hot salt of our own dry sweat, 
wash our underwear in your park fountains, 
and dreams and wishes no longer hiss 
through our nights as we take up your benches. 
We can't afford tears. They would spread like our lice 
and tuberculosis and drown you everywhere, 
workers, New Yorkers. Go on your way, 
there is nothing between us. 
Let the politicos ply your votes 
with false promises to house or starve us. 
New York City of money as God at the top

Neeeeeew 
Yooork!
The wind blows out of the gates of the day. 
Let the night keep what the night takes away, 
dreamt in a dream the heavy soul, somewhere 
struck suddenly and dark down to its knees, 
sighs as a griffon sighs off in the orphic air -- 
awakes as morning at the brown brink eastward springs 
and the whole landscape flushes on a sudden at a sound -- 
the clang of waking life; the streets are stirred, 
            birds fly to the glistening roofs and sing; 
an omnibus across the bridge 
            crawls like a yellow butterfly, 
while I stand on the roadway and on the pavement grey 
and dream that beauty passes like a dream 
            fastened to a dying animal.
Memory of autumn, of menopausal bleeding, 
and the blood from a creature you hunted 
in the autuirm woods oozed over a wet rock, 
you used as a table in the brook, 
carving the meat from the bone, 
skinning it down to naked flesh I squatted 
behind a stump, shuddering at the death 
I'd seen, crying secretly as I peed and bled 
into the dying and wondrous leaf soaked earth. 
I'd wanted to go with you, 
in this awful autumn of aging, I'd said I go 
bird watching with binoculars 
as you hunted with your shotgun. 
I was tired of my girlish squeamishness, 
of worries of bombs poised in silos, 
germ warfare bred in laboratories, 
chemicals stirred to deadly alchemies, genius death, 
a lump flowering, a cancer blooming in my left breast 
to be removed next week by the surgeon's laser knife 
all in the hope of flesh 
how the deer trembled to its death 
first day of hunting season 
fattened against winter from summer's gathering, 
nibble by nibble of wild berry, young shoots, 
lichen and wild fruit-only to fall 
in a leap over the swell of forest floor, 
into our dell crunching leaves, a flurry like the explosive 
dive made by the osprey as it splashes into the lake 
to seize a fish from on high. Suddenly, 
there in the quiet gully of noon, leaves rustled, 
twigs cracked as the deer ran toward us, seated silently 
in wait, sounds squirrel chatters, bird chirps quieted down 
from our alien intrusion of the woods bleeding red 
oak and yellow maple, beech leaves carpeting 
the floor of cathedrals, trees' gothic in their reach heavenward 
toward dazzling blue sky. Camouflaged by bark, she leapt 
into our gully 
where your shotgun was poised beyond all 
my arguments against its cruel blasted noise. 
            "From the beginning of time, men have hunted!" 
This is how I stay in touch with reality. 
When the secret police come for your family, 
you want them to have the only weapons? 
A man has to know how to survive. To hunt as he's hunted!" 

Terror everywhere in the global heat trap, 
puppets of oil and nuclear barons 
elected by advertisements for more profits. 
Homeless dying in the streets of our city 
while Turks were driven from Bulgaria, 
Armenians killed in Russia, Hungarians 
murdered in Rumania, indigenous people everywhere 
destroyed in apartheid systems, the Philippines stolen 
from Filipinos, El Salvador from Salvadorans, 
as Haiti's rain forests were chopped to dust 
and an Iranian and PAN AM jet crashed 
like fallen deer into a gully killing your son 
as this doe fled another hunter's gun, flew into 
our murderous view and I shouted, "There!"
and you spun around and fired 
into this bleeding autumn turned 
to glorious color -- 
dying leaves fallen to fertilize 
the next coming of leaves 
back into roots of bleeding trees 
like me, bleeding too much as I grow old 
and matronly, thinking of him -- 
your young son gone forever 
on his college semester in Europe 
into oblivion -- 
gone amidst the garbage of greed about to backfire 
as shotguns that kill the killers holding them. 
But, your aim was accurate, your gun well kept, 
you shot the doe, bagged it, the first time 
I'd seen you kill, 
though I knew you'd got deer before 
and in winter wild boar 
fried squirrels and possums since you were a boy 
escaping alone into the wild where 
your Jewish father, a Turkish immigrant, wanted you to learn 
to survive, defend yourself: "A man 
must be a man to be a man!" he'd said, 
and I was tired of arguing non-violence 
to you and the rest of the warring world. 
With my bird watching binoculars, 
I'd joined you in the hunt 
and saw the deer coming toward us, 
my eyes and ears sharper than your fading ones. 
I wanted you at seventy to win, to feel young again, 
as the week before you'd lain 
in an emergency ward 
needing a transfusion. You'd bled 
too much from your aging gut. "Acute diverticulosis, 
an ailment of old men," the doctor said 
and sent you to your hospital bed. 
I wanted you to feel strong. Your hand 
squeezed the trigger 
and the doe fell, trembling 
and I covered my ears 
and unexpected tears stung my eyes 
as I watched you fire again 
to finish the quivering animal -- 
a second shot to the temple, meat 
for the winter of your seventieth year. 

While you carved, I peed blood into the red leaves 
and listened to the starlings rustling the branches, 
the sparrows chirp in the brush, your knife 
on stone, carved 
the doe into meat, all her intricate muscles bled, 
her beautiful eyes stilled, her graceful head 
a trophy for a wall, her skin to be tanned 
into leather boots and gloves, her ribs exposed 
like our vulnerable hearts pumping 
until they stop soon. Beyond this autumn 
the laser knife of a brilliant and self-destructive technocracy 
will carve my breast, remove a tumor 
to determine if time is benign, 
and if it is, 
I will cook for you 
the delicate, gamey venison 
which I won't taste, 
as I eat less and less meat 
and you grow old tasting the hunt, 
controlling death by giving it and I give into it 
bleeding more heavily than ever in my youth, 
as I grow beyond the years of fecund mothering -- 
our different ways of facing death, 
your fight against it, giving it, my giving into it, 
the power I can't possess of gun, or knife, or cock- 
sure ways. 

I wept like a squeamish girl 
seeing the deer tremble 
and your old hands trembling, too, as you carved 
its heart out and I knew that you 
are hurt by your own necessity, 
saddened like me by blood autumn, 
her shimmering beauty.
The future of religion
is in the mystery of touch.
-D.H. Lawrence
peacefully on the lake to see what we might sight, 
some exciting species of wild life 
for our list of wondrous things we've seen since spring 
and there before us on the high limbs of a russet sugar maple, 
ablaze with October sun, beside a burnished, 
crimson Chestnut Oak, 
sits a flock of Turkey Vultures, 
red headed with hooked, black buzzard beaks, they pose 
before rays of morning sun, wings spread to preen and bathe 
away vermin from under the their wing pits. Black feathers bask 
in iridescent hue. These ancient birds were sacred to Egyptians, 
carrion cleaners of the woods, eaters of the sacrificial entrails 
of deer, sheep or lamb, bear or rat, swallowers of wasted flesh 
who never kill to eat, but simply make the dead fly 
from the rotting earth, soar toward the sky, 
taking dead souls heavenward. 

Holy birds, Black Vultures 
who can make the carrion flesh of the dead 
rise again into the autumn sky ahead, 
you who never prey on the living or kill as we 
and the mighty hawks or eagles do, 
carrion eaters, big black buzzards of the blooming autumn, 
please fly with my dead spirit to the tallest trees, 
bask my soul in sun, bless my pain with fun 
of soaring free, run with me heavenward flapping flying, 
sailing on the wind amidst the flutter of colors and sun 
mixed in every hue and mood, bring me to your forest roost, 
tell me all the secrets of night so that I might 
not fear the rotting purple and blue flesh we all become 
when blood autumn finally leaves our view and we he dormant 
as the trees in an eternal springless dormancy! 
Black birch dead upon the ground, I gather your debris 
to light the fire and make my home blaze with the warmth 
of your death in the hearth. Tree, once a thing of beauty 
that I burn the way a buzzard sails on wind, 
nurtured by the dead turned to carrion, heal me, let me learn 
to love my impatient husband again after our cruel fight, 
and let my soul fly with the birds above the glass still lake 
wherein the sleek fish eat and mate.
and view the "freaks" 
watching us, and offer a smile 
to the snake charmer. She nods at us 
            knowing we are lovers returning from paradise. 
At night, just before dawn of the last day 
of an old year, we have a common nightmare. 
Each falls asleep and wakes alone 
in a dream on a cold shore 
far from home, without shelter from wind, sun 
            dark, cold, heat. 
I feel like a tiny breathing thing alone in a vast night 
no hand anywhere to hold mine. I call to you, friend, 
brother, lover, husband, but you can't answer 
out of your body, alone in your dream crying for friend, 
sister, lover wife! 

We wake into life 
sure of dying under the frozen sky 
and mute stars, glistening with winter light. 
We have returned from paradise and visited a carnival 
many times again, to view the "freaks" watching us 
and smile at the knowing snake charmer. 
Sometimes, as we look at the pain in the other's eyes 
each recalls the nightmare had separately, 
but we do not speak of it. We hold hands into new years, 
knowing all new years turn old, and listen to the night, 
snow creaking in mounds, and the air iced from the Northwind

For the sake of the other 
we do not say 
how each together 
is alone 
returning from paradise.
I'm your nurse because the doctors 
wear penises. I'm Scarlet O'Hara 
wearing an ancient Chinese mask at your 
funeral. Yesterday, I looked into 
the mirror and your scars 
were on my face. I call to you 
because fathers disembowel children 
as a ritual to war gods. I call to you 
because dart throwers chase me 
through a circus of elevators 
and orphans wander 
wounded by madness in the streets, 
asking for my last slice of bread. 

I'm the Whore of Babylon 
sucking your love, 
pulling weeds from your throat. 
I'm the sheepdog wandering in your dreams, 
the white cane tapping away your blindness. 
My breasts are sensitive to the rain 
because I listened to the rain with you.
Oh my love, I will carry 
your lantern ahead, 
whispering light for your steps. 
Please touch me to come to you. 

Toward the light, Father, Mother, 
shining harbor ahead, 
all grievance closed on our breasts, 
sound coloring words to breath. 

Glide with me through my river. 
I've come this way, too, 
slithering out as new flesh. 
Our bodies burst into bloom. 

Hands know silk, skin and petals, 
wet mouth, apple's breath. 
Place roses into my skull. 
Our bones are white, pupils black. 

Oh my love, shine with my life, 
be as my brother, 
yin and yang flowing bright milk 
from autumn leaves in the grass. 

Oceans swirl, marble blue earth, 
hear, taste, feel, see, heal, 
toward the explosion of light, 
eyes opening souls from death.
They've flown south now 
and one Great Egret fishes the pond 
as Broadwinged Hawks begin their migrations, 
kenneling on thermal currents of wind 
off above yellowing mountains. 
Now, Snakeweed blooms along the trail choking 
white and purple Asters. A few bleeding 
leaves fall amidst wilting greenery. Poison 
Ivy turns red with warning. 

My eighty-three-year-old mother still argues 
with my father, twelve years dead. Their hatred 
reverberates in a back room 
of my head, rattling memories of my lonely childhood. 
Their loathing for each other 
colors all my days with pain. I loved him 
because he loved me best, but I look like her, 
my face and spirit tear 
at each other. 
I am the child of hate. 

A wounded love sprouts like a weed 
from watery depths, 
uncultivated, 
flowers, white and purple, bloom, 
even in these days of dying 
leaves. 

Beyond winter, 
no one 
grieves.
Over frozen rocks, water flows, 
"like time" poets say. Time, the only thawed thing in this 
grey winter dark. Our lake is ice 
and I have come at fifty-three to a quiet dutiful life. 
You, older than I, have lost your strength 
to arthritis. Pain killers have numbed you 
and your passionate nature waxes like the moon. 
Hypertension's therapeutic drug makes you drowsy, too. 
Beyond the horizon, there's all ice and snow. 
I crunch on through the dormant woods, 
leaving the icy lake behind, and you, 
reading in our warm bed full of books. 

Here fallen Eastern Hemlocks killed by Asian blight 
he cracked across forbidden ice. Their pedestals, drip dry pine 
needles on the frozen snow. 

No, not even a vulture 
climbs the horizon of barren trees. 
I'm on my knees without God for a crutch, just the wondrous science 
of relentless cycles of seasons, new life from decay and carrion. 
A few crows cackle and caw above, a welcome sign of vitality. 
I have a dear daughter grown into her own love and work, 
an aged mother to whom I feel undying duty, 
I have my work ahead and that is all. The lake is frozen cold, no 
fish leap or stir in her. Even the flock of vultures who lived above 
her warming their wings in fall, sunning lice away, have strayed 
to another lake. Nothing rides a thermal, nothing flies or stirs 
on the horizon all is dull and grey. 
I crunch on through the frozen snow. 
I do not even dream of spring. 
I listen to the laughter of departing crows. 
Time the only thawed thing flows 
over the icy rocks and streams 
into the woods until somewhere longer, 
farther than I can go it finds the ocean, 
where it loses its deltas to become 
part of a churning entropic universe 
too vast to know.
Oh God, or Goddess, make me a child again 
beneath the dreaming tree where leaves drop golden 
sunlight all around me 
in a fantasy of benevolent faith 
which extols itself in "Thee."

Now, no answers come from above 
or below. 
Silence sings in my aging cranium -- 
throbbing like Prospero's 
to let loose infinity. 
Eternity embraces entropy. 

"We are to blame 
for the blood that flows from wounds." 
says love as it glows red from the bled heart 
under the hanging tree. 

A fairy land of angels, gods and goddesses 
cavorts in mythologies or legends old as Gilgamesh, 
answering from the brain as it talks to itself, 
right to left, left to right lobe, 
each one of us is alone on the vast globe 
doomed to dust or carrion. 
Even in the best touch of skin to another's within, 
each is alone 
with conscience in search of piety 
which comes easily in old age 
when the animal appetite 
is done with the flesh 
and longs to escape 
body into pure mind, 
as if there were a God or Goddess 
who were kind enough 
to embrace the perfect zero 
we become 
when we're done with breath 
and animal flesh meets animal death.
I try to sing so that our scars will glisten 
as crystal goblets full of purple grapes 
we raise to our lips, our last supper 
on Earth we'll share as communion: 
bounty of blue water, black earth, afloat 
in silence except for our stammering 
before She passes into the past 
sizzled by fire or ice our shimmering 
nerves cling together on the edge 
of threatened futures. The past is 
eternal only to lovers. 

I want to sing to you in a language 
of light bright as feathers, hope, 
alone in my skin tonight, 
sings as it falls in slivers 
of light through air as rain in my sight 
and my heart wells in my throat 
as a bird struggles 
against a night predator 
and darkness presses over it. 

We worry if our children will live to speak 
a language of light and sing to their children 
of silver apples of night, 
golden apples of day, 
each must gather wandering over green meadows 
where daises or wild violets spring, 
blooming gloriously to death beside brooks, 
streams froth and tumble dreams 
from nooks and crannies, run 
over rocks, secret forest places where dear deer 
nibble wild blueberries, or lions stalk 
blood from the language of light. My incessant hope 
tastes tongues of light; my arms will hold you 
safely in the night, until time 
in time 
is done.
shines, at last! 
Spring will come again. 
It's an old song, you say. 
But I say 
the heart must learn it anew. 

Now Chickadees and Titmice 
peck amidst the winter berries 
and pines. 
Soon the Rubythroated Hummingbird will flit 
among honeysuckle blooms, 
a new calf will be born 
in the barn on the hill 

and a pregnant doe 
will nibble my crocuses 
before they're full.
One lone Loon glides along the lake. 
Lost from a mate, 
she wears a smart suit of black tweed, 
checkered and flecked with white. 
Her black dagger beak poised 
to spear a silvery fish 
as she dives deep to hide 
from the Canada Goose who swims too near. 

After a long wait 
she surfaces far off. 
Ancient heavy boned bird, 
different from all the rest, 
superb diver, odd singer, like you, 
I sing my weird time, loony with the beauty of spring, 
rebirth amidst the fears of a weakened heart. Blood 
circulates poorly now as wrinkles prepare me 
to want less of life. 

Little peach beak of the Goldfinch, yellow as my Forsythia bush 
which droops its fountains of bright blossoms over the walk, 
crimson cardinal flower and bird, sun rise 
and sunset of natural color, wonder of Earth, 
amazing bright green and yellow visions of thawing woods, 
it is enough that April has come again 
like an idiot babbling and strewing flowers, April 
the kindest month, 
reminding me it's enough 
to live like a lonely loon lost 
on a cool lake, just to see the Bank Swallows swoop, 
the iridescent Tree Swallow sail across the azure sky, 
the Barn Swallows leap up with the loon's cry, loony loon am I, 
lost on the lake, time a threat now as I call my last cries 
over the water -- violins in my ears! Sing, gold 
and red raspberry finches, Song Sparrows, white throated 
ones, too, and Wood or Hermit Thrush, sing 
your sweet tunes, sound your small flutes 
while I laugh like a loon 
lost in dandelion wine, lost in Wood Anemone, 
searching for the Wood Ducks who shyly fly, white wing stripes 
on a dark silhouetted sky, high and higher, 
no clumsy flyer like the dinosaur loon, 
lost in its own wild and plaintive tune. 

Tap of Downy Woodpecker, 
laughing song of the Northern Flicker, 
sweet throated Yellow Warbler, Mourning Dove, 
tiny Black Capped Chickadee, Grey Tufted Titmouse, 
sing to me, whistle away, fill my day with lazy wonder. 
I'm tired of diving down and rising up 
to gulp a silvery fish. I want to float, heavy 
boned on the deep water, no waves, no wind, 
only gentle balmy ripples of spring. 
I can't grieve the bombs that could be trees, 
the children that didn't come from me, 
those who have not lived or died too soon, 
let me fall on my knees in the grass 
and sleep in the meadow on an old deer path. 

Sing to me loony Common Loon 
tunes, laugh a nocturnal laugh, of how the last 
first green of life, the last noon of sun, 
the last glimpse of light, 
matters!
A pregnant woman gardens, naked in her glass greenhouse. 
Plants she tends and water grow from her fingers, 
green silhouettes against her full belly; 
round in the moonlight, a rapture 
flows through her breasts to the mouth of a child, 
containing all melody, 
while father-starved boys 
in dark cellars of crowded cities 
slam-dance to anti-music made of nuclear explosions. 

Earth hemorrhages Her plush wealth, bloody bombs 
phallic shaped from wheatless silos, 
prisoners of peace accurately aimed 
hate fail-safe or fail-deadly force 
opposite to love, to eyes kissed, 
bread baking in warm kitchens, 
babies at nippled breasts, 
suckled on green leaves which rise serene 
from muddy earth, wet with animal dreams 
as our human hands 
in these dark times 
touch bliss.
The missile like a final guillotine of a man's world 
stands erect against immense history -- 
a red and purple sun 
sets as the scent of orange flowers 
excites the wind. 
Giant waves, powerful 
Greek tragedies, drum rolls 
greet ears like shells 
filled with the voice of the executioner 
as he reads his list 
to the crowd and trees tremble; 
big continents protrude like butterfly wings, 
flutter in the atmosphere of blue seas 
swirling in drifts and currents 
as they cling to Earth's surface 
as She spins amidst women's wails 
and birthings. 
The cathedral explodes 
with organ music by Bach and Haydn 
and a machine-gun in the rhythym of Lohengren 
grinds blood from the passers by 
who are surprised to die 
in the middle of the priest's sermon. 
Chaos like a riot of birds 
chatters over the bridge 
to the other side of nowhere 
until a fragile child small and wild 
weeps her way, shoving through the crowds of the dead 
who have come to witness their own execution. 
She peeps out bleary eyed from between the bloody legs 
of the woman who sells refreshments to survive 
and with her innocent eyes 
enchants all meanings into place 
like a rose garden fu11 of trellisses and cakes.
Because of the cat's eye marble of your passion, 
you old sage of roses, I slap my hand 
on your big rump, old word whore! 
You discovered the secrets of your body 
only to keep them silent to the grave. 

You contemporary of my late Italian grandmother 
whose cadaver appears before me in my dreams, 
her clitoris gleaming like a ruby jewel -- 
grandma who gave birth to twenty children 
alone in her bed, her own midwife. Grandma 
who never knew the numbing power of orgasmic 
potency, pool of cosmic energy 
for the tormented body. 

For you, Dear Grandma, and for you, Ole Gertrude, 
for all the women who were buried in their 
living bodies, hiding sexual hysteria from doctors 
who performed surreptitious clitorectomies, 
or sewed their lips over the tiny bud of ecstacy 
so men might go on supreme through 
thrusting centuries, 
for you, 
rain of the womb, spindle of Aprhrodite, 
bud of Venus, tree of Daphne, moon of Diana, 
I chant the song of the three, "Tender Buttons," 
the sign of the trinity: 
           "THE NIPPLE, THE NIPPLE, THE CLITORIS,"
and The Holy Ghost
is "The Mother of Us All!"
Oh, anus, through the centuries 
men have smuggled diamonds in you 
and dope. Homosexuals have written odes 
to your sensational glories. 

But, I have never wanted more from you 
than a comfortable passage 
of the wasted fuel of my life 
as death the exquisite trap door 
opens for the fall through eternity: 
exit from life, 
light into darkness, 
contrast, perception, 
crucifixion, resurrection. 

The iris of the eye 
opens as you -- 
the flower of the body. 

The flower in the eye 
opens to let in sight, 
and you, 
the flower of the body 
to let out shit, 
and from sight, 
from shit, 
come flowers 
most awesome as they bloom themselves 
to death.
falls from the wet mouth of the old dove 
and sinks into a river of fire rushing toward the delta 
where the oceans will catch flame and evaporate with lust 
and the children's lungs will be sucked of oxygen, 
but the president doesn't notice. His polished desk 
blinds him with veneer. 

And on the street the crowds rush to glimpse the television 
screen alight with the fire of electricity 
like the body politic 
as it broadcasts the baseball scores. 

It's the final playoff of the World Serious
and we are here, all of us with flesh eyeballs alight 
with the wings of the dove as they flutter on beyond 
the red and blue sunset 
which continues to outdo itself year after year 
since the mastodons crept from the sea of blood 
baring mammalian breasts full of warm white milk 
for all the many colored faces of earth, 
children as they suck life from leaves of grass 
withering now in the threat of fire or ice, 
eternal winter which comes to each, one by one, 
but need not be passed in one blast of heat to all the young 
buds of being wafting perfumes as they burn 
from bright autumn rust, beauty so enough 
that it kills the caring heart with its own ceasing.
I had a dream, which was not all a dream. 
The bright sun was extinguished, and the stars 
Did wander darkling in the eternal space, 
Rayless, and pathless; and the icy Earth 
Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air; 
Morn came and went -- and came, and brought no day.... 

-Lord Byron from "Darkness"
I.

Where can mad money be spent 
on windless meadows, vaporized forests, 
under dusty snow falling forever acid, 
when love sucked from bleached bones 
in ashes floats in particles of lips, 
songs, paintings or poems for eons 
on and on to nowhere's nothing...? 

I can't comprehend nothing of nothing. 
"Non capisco nulla di niente,"
my Italian grandmother said 
before she died at sixty-five 
of emphysema from her coal stove 
burning through the cold 
of dark winters like the eternal one to come 
exploding from Godhead to warhead 
through centuries of silly soft women 
powder-puffed and waiting for men 
to come and come, and now they may come 
no more...to smell perfumed grasses, or see 
breasts of velvet blue mountains, red sunsets 
or morning's rise after night closes their eyes 
forever, Mother Earth, yes, Capitol Earth, I spell you 
rich with color, mood and mud. 
Slime and beauty beyond mortal words 
from which we come with our ears and tongues, 
giving ears and tongues to children 
and sleek weapons that could demolish us 
to metaphorless similes of dust.

II.

Walt Whitman's voice extolled these states and stars 
as Democratic Vistas -- but they were stolen 
from the Redman who reaps cancerous lungs from mined uranium, 
and fire water spills from Her green hills, 
polluted valleys, fields of waving grain, 
full of nitrates, purple mountains majesty, America, plump woman, 
your cornucopia fills with poisons, spills 
with nuclear barons' oil kills, 
distilling carcinogens from landfills full of greed's garbage. 
Dolphins, seals, and sea otters breed P.C.B.s. Exxons and G.E.s 
P.R. lies and missiles labeled "Peacemakers" that can sizzle 
billions in an instant, killing all forever fools of nothing, 
no 
thing, 
unimaginable as zero so profound, 
all Promethean longings go unbound.

Have you noticed how angry women are now 
between their laughters, 
tears loom among their witches' brooms, 
because they feel the end approaching all. 
It makes their gonads reel with rage. 
Since there's too little love for berries, peaches, melons, 
mud, and disillusioned children, women have less hope 
about the future as their intuition throbs between their legs 
forced open to keep life coming from legislated bodies, gates 
to heaven or hell, since Satan fell from grace, 
into Eden's apple trees and Eve fell on her knees 
before him in male mythologies of misogynistic verse. 
Earth, so little loved and cursed, She'll explode 
with manufactured greed for plastic fruits and flowers, polymers, 
poisonous whims of monolithic powers, 
money mad with mad money 
grabbed by Morgan, Bechtel, whose name 
rhymes with hell, Grumman, Hughes, 
who helps hold the fuse, AT&T who owns me 
and thee, down to our bones. 
Executives profits for motifs and motives 
to please the very rich with more riches, and mutants, 
birth defects of atzent orange or irradiating bomb tests -- 
as astrophysicists describe a black hole 
sucking everything to entropy -- 
and a gap in the ozone layer of climatology 
widens as acid rain kills lakes and forests and aflotoxins 
like alien enemies, biological warfare agents rain 
back down on us. All poisonous greed can't be flushed 
away in a Rabelaisian toilet of the universe, 
as it comes back to curse our children, poor or rich in one 
uni- 
verse 
all that matters us into matters beyond us 
and our separated nations 
as each child of us, comes in innocence, dumb with beauty 
and the notion of all motion, centrifugal force, 
unites nations, flagged by the same photo of Earth 
from outer space, mother of an entire race of one 
blessed or cursed Earth, Mother of Us, All 
oceanic womb -- 
man to all children 
and we are one in all and only all in one is won. 

IV.

There's no exotic enemy! No "them" and "we." 
Just ourselves, deep in "us" 
a fascination with the exotic other -- 
dwells in dark sentiment -- this passion 
with the blood of the other 
stains our hands and tongues. 
We poke at the fruit, to see 
its juices run on the ground, 
tear the rose from its stem, scatter petals to the wind, 
pluck the butterfly's wings for the microscope's lens, 
plunge a fist into a teetering tower of bricks, 
watch the debris sail, explode fireworks 
until all crumbles to dust and is undone, open 
to the curious eye. Does this or that creature die as I die, 
cry as I cry, writhe as I would if my guts were ripped 
from the walls of my flesh, my ripe heart eaten alive. 
The probing questions of sacred exploration, 
as if science can progress
without empathy. Does a penis feel as a clitoris feels? 
Do slanted eyes see as I see? Is a white or black skin 
or sin the same as a red one; is it like me? Does it burn, 
does it peel, does it boil in oil or reel in pain? 
The obsession to possess the other so completely 
that his blood fills the mouth and you eat of her flesh 
from its bone, and then know if she, if he, feels as you feel 
if your world is real. 

V.

These are the word wounds, 
roots of mushroom clouds to rise 
from the pockmarked earth: 
"Guinea, dago, spick, nigger, polack, wasp, mick, 
chink, jap, frog, kraut, russkie red, bastard, kike, 
bitch, macho pig, gimp, fag, dike, cunt, prick,"
word wounds to make stench of flesh follow 
sprayed dust of children's eyes 
melted from wondering sockets, animal skin, thighs, 
men's hands, women's sighs 
roasted in a final feast of fire 
beasts caught like lemmings 
in a leap to Armageddon's 
false resurrection. 
Word wounds rise from visions of charred lips, 
burnt books, paper ashes, crumbled libraries, stones 
under which plastic pens 
and computers are fried amid the last cried 
words, smoke to pay lip service -- 
as Orphic light rages 
against the dying of the light 
and all dust into dust returns 
to the last word, 
sigh of a burning leaf turning: "Life live, 
leaf live, love life leaf live..." 

VI.

There are those mornings 
when the spirit stretches out of itself, 
reaches up from the breast, radiates from the groin 
beyond sex into song and sensual delight 
to see light fall on leaves, 
growing green glisten with animal sight 
-- and the Romance of Photosynthesis begins 
all beginnings. 
There are those afternoons 
when knowing beyond saying christens; the body 
with love for its own breath 
and being breathes in harmony with leaves. 
There are those evenings when the sunsets with red 
and blue glory -- even over teeming cities 
and glass windows blaze wondrous color, 
though children rot in slum gutters 
or drug themselves out of the pain 
of all that's unfair or insane. 

You've smelled the familiar wood, mud, fern aroma, 
as red and gold leaves spread a cover over 
dried grass and whispering wind on water sings 
the stupid and stupendous music of creation, 
of an awesome autumn milk-
weed bursts in silk 
puffs of seeds and a water spider speeds 
patterning the water mirroring your face 
amidst scarlet fringes of a maple flecked with green, 
serene skies utterly blue with the lies of our lives. 
You've seen, heard, felt such awe and you, too, 
know wounds of words can burst in fire. 
You're tired, too, of trying to speak 
the language of leaves as you grow older like me -- 
lichens blooming on the side of a dead tree. 
So, sing a song of peace with me, please, 
because death turns to beauty in the dying leaves 
and moss is soft and inviting. Tell me, toll me, 
please, listen with me to the leaves 
aching with eyes and animal sighs 
and cries for mercy in the fall from grace 
to this quiet, quiet place. 

VII.

There are still those days when peace reigns 
in desire's mouth and nothing more is longed for 
beyond the taste of color, music of hearts and lungs, 
sigh of sun, wet of water, touch of the sea, sweet 
juice squeezed on the tongue. Then 
the body is possessed by light 
until the pitcher of sleep fills with milk 
poured into the moon and a song of sleep 
glows in the throat -- giving night its breathy music, 
as tortured beasts howl far off in city caverns, 
cries from eyes where genitals are plucked flowers 
crushed by sadistic curiosity, bled 
into troubled sleep. The child 
melted by synthetic doom shrieks. 
A premeditated alchemic act devised 
to sear human flesh, mutates the baby's body 
into horror. Brilliantly, germs are bred in laboratories 
to foul enemy armies with venereal disease; prostitutes lurk 
on the edges of military bases which protect the rich 
from the rich -- selling flesh like excrement. 

VIII.

In civilized rooms, 
rich executives wage secret money wars, 
deal drugs for profits -- devils disguised by designer clothes 
live elegant lives that keep the poor unfed 
and laboring in heat -- fountains of their sweat 
fed to gun lords who want more and more 
corpses of untimely death buried in pieces under flowering trees 
without eyes, hands, guitars or slippers. 
Those who die tortured will scream in all our nightmare dreams 
until brutes are bred into angels, and prisons emptied of agony, 
workers clothed with more than chains, until 
puppet dictators lose their strings, 
until sparrows sing like nightingales, 
and fly like herons above the war for crumbs, 
-- until I learn to love you with your different body, 
your disposition imperfect as mine, 
until then, death will go on wearing the soldier's uniform 
of his illustrious career -- a salute masks his leer. 
Like a bullfighter he carves 
the mighty bull, to still the beast 
with graceful cunning, his sleek 
sword hidden in his silk cape. 
His missiles poised in their silos 
empty of grain, filled with fires of the final feast 
he'll eat with his cavernous mouth, carnivorous teeth. 
His masculine chin chews children, spits 
their wasted bones into cinders, swallows 
their budding bodies, and the honey of their 
breath as it expires, drips blood as saliva from his lips, 
a blistered grin. In his hand, he juggles 
the blue and crystal ball full of swirling waters, 
over a steel and concrete gravestone 
where all our names are inscribed with Dante, 
Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, Lady Murasaki, 
Emily Dickinson, Rembrandt, Madame Curie, 
Einstein, Luther King, Chi'u Chin or Ghandi... 
fading into dust beyond the last stupendous flash 
of life urges into cocky deadly fireworks, 
eternal winter, as names 
and the word could become in the space of moments, 
syllables to no one and nothing perceives 
light or darkness, as you and I, love, caress 
each others' eyes before we touch, hand on smile inventing love. 
But cold and silent of human song the planets could spin 
unknown to anyone or anything -- 
fragile as our flesh which thrills with love's 
impulse, electric touch of empathy's 
mysterious imagery, waters flowing mind 
which cannot dream "nothing" without thinking "zero" 
as a perfect some- 
thing of the algebraic kind. 

IX.

We are all one human creature 
bound by one earth 
under one sun -- moon mutant nations where all children's 
ears hear "Songs of Innocence," 
as corporational apes of toxic wastes 
breathe alchemic greed bloated powers bigger 
than all our tiny flesh made lives, 
or little seeds of giant Sequoia trees, 
most ancient living things of earth, 
older than king's tombs, true cathedrals 
of the blue Pacific as she rocks, swirling 
melodies with the Atlantic's green currents, 
currencies...rain songs, sounds swell wells, 
lakes, faucets, brooks' runes, oceans' tunes, 
mystic drafts of summer wetness, cool drink seeping 
into thirst, 
Earth 
nearly all water of which we are made one human 
bound by one wet planet 
under one maddening moon, 
under one arrogant sun, 
under one pale watery moon, 
under one 
bright thirsty sun.
"Hold on to dreams 
For if dreams die 
Life is a broken 
Winged bird 
And cannot fly." 

-Langston Hughes 

"The wind? I am the wind. The sea and the moon? 
I am the sea and the moon. Tears, pain, love, bird-
flights? I am all of them. I dance what I am. 
Sin, prayer, flight, the light that never was on land 
or sea? I dance what I am." 

-from a poem, Isadora Duncan, by Carl Sandburg
I hadn't watched maggots 
closely before. 

The way they squirm and burrow 
their way in. 

What curious things! 

How characteristic of sperm. 

Somehow, 

how like wheat!
He thinks of her, a furry animal -- her center 
soft, warm with worry -- 
but wet, inviting wonder, 
a place he can fill with himself.
She feels his need pressed between her thighs, 
waiting to be opened by his touch, his fingers will the thrill 
of her desire -- light explodes 
a sunburst in her dark mind -- 
her face like a winter when she worries 
about all the murdered flowers tom flesh tortured shrieks -- 
her skin like a spring blooming petals, pitying 
pink, yellow, purple veined 
buds of beneficent being, his red heart bums him 
with life she forces like an indigestible summer of merciless heat. 

She thinks how mean and hard he seems at times 
and pulls herself in and closes 
wanting him to open her with his need 
and then he rubs her back and neck 
and she hears his sweet murmur 
as she longs to be strong enough to mother him 
and his seed always waiting to spill into her 
and make her bloom like a round melon of light 
that talks and sees roses which must die to be 
beautiful like the sea from which she smells 
her own body throbbing and rolling 
as he thrusts need into her need to be kneaded 
necessary as bread to earth planted in spring so that grass 
grows for the eating of all things vibrant in the green sun 
of summer festering with insects, birds, blossoms, sticky throated 
buds oozing sap from her lap full of flowers, syllables spill 
prattled from small round tongues, animals that come 
seeing out of her breathing belly -- laughing, weeping, seeping songs 
and dances of pleasure, pain wonder -- bleeding in and out 
of the mystery that only skies can know, 
only mountains touch, 
only stars breathe.
has a strength 
destined to know me. 
Wherever my lips touch you 
they find a kiss 
as if my hands 
had made you of clay 
exactly 
as I would have wished. 

Your hands, your arms, 
your chest, thighs, 
your special parts 
are missing parts of me, 
vessel into which you fit, 
one river of two streams 
flowing into one ocean. 

Before we met, 
I was on the verge 
of automation. 
As metal I'd have rusted, 
atrophied. 

As flesh, 
I'll stay alive unto death 
feeling your hands kneading me 
to breath.
The blood of a fish is like 
the blood of a bleeding woman. 
But we call fish cold blooded 
and a mother's love has the 
hottest blood in the galaxy. 

The seagull's squeal is like 
the squeal of a newborn child -- 
tormented, 

and the blood of a man 
is like the blood of a wandering gull 
hunting free and hunted. 

All blood is red so that we can see it, 
and anger is red 
so that we can know it 
and all bleeding blood is angry 
like the wound of war.
They want to have the babies when they are old, 
though the cocks of the walk, 
their breasts and bellies grow, good Papas, 
into womanhood, emotions are let go 
like tears that run down steel swords gone dull. 

Their eyes brighten with pretty daughters 
who sparkle like their mates did long ago. 
They want to be pregnant with girlish life, 
to feel themselves rise quick again 
just at the thought. These men women 
have expected to be perfect for them, 
creatures of confused mother love, 
searching for the breast of Honeysuckle summer 
again, longing which grows into 
fleeting gold, then silver snow. 

I keep having a dream of an old woman, anxious rhapsody, 
disapproving of me, and wake 
to realize I have grown old 
enough to disapprove of my younger self 
full of mistakes, and the dust 
is flying, radio-active everywhere. I can't 
shovel the snow fast enough to get back on the road. 
I left the windows open and the car's buried 
inside and out with snow, snow, snow 
and dark comes soon. Everyone I ask gives 
a different direction on the roads. Cold. 
I can't remember any of the ways. 
I'm too old for babies now. 

Sun on leaves is enough for me 
if profits before children and trees 
don't waste all to nothing, I'll listen 
to Vivaldi concertos to fill
my aging years. I'll make Japanese water colors, 
or sing along with birds, learn their tunes and colors: 
iridescent Magpie, Black-capped Chickadee 
chirping in a narrow pine tree, Great Blue Heron or Jay, 
Red-tailed Hawk, Screech Owl, Mourning Dove, 
Ruby-Throated Hummingbird, Indigo Bunting, 
Scarlet Tanager, Redbellied Woodpecker, Yellow-bellied 
Sapsucker, White-breasted Nuthatch, Redwinged Blackbird, 
Brown Creeper, Golden-crowned Kinglet, 
each with his own personality 
like the tiny pink mouse, in my daughter's snake cage 
waiting to be eaten for a desert snake's prey. 
We are all like that, struggling on our backs waiting 
to be blown by greed to dust or snow 
as we grow old and some say there's nothing
beyond flesh gone dry. 

There are leaf patterns, 
bubbles baked into the bread, 
chemical variegations 
even as the mouse is slowly ingested, 
mammalian blood becomes reptilian, 
all chums in cauldrons of smoke and dreams. 

How intricately a snake loops, 
what a slow moving toward death, 
what cannibal embrace, 
the mouse's head in the snake's, 
what a quick moving toward death, 
what a slow moving 
toward life, 
what a quick ending is death. 
Please 
let the children live. 
Everyone 
who's sane 
loves 
them.
I attempt to rearrange the past in Venetian Palaces 
built by blood thirsts or delicate lusts, 
full of plaintive strains of Monteverdi 
trilled in Gothic arches. 
Through a camera's eye 
I look backward on hope, 
every lost stroke between us 
mesmerizes mind 
into something fair and kind -- 
as here, in the present, dying drones 
drone in autumn sun, 
leaves rot, purple asters turn to grey seed -- 
like tiny mushroom clouds dotting umber and sienna land- 
            scapes of late autumn, muddled earth 
            with the garbage of greed 
everywhere, crushed cans, chemical poisons, wasted paper, 
but in my mind, dusk pours in slanted light of high windows, 
twilight motes dance amid red velvet curtains 
in Venetian Palaces above shimmering waters, narrow streets, 
we lie embracing, intertwined forever 
until darkness erases us, 
the woods here in dark. 
The stamina of memory opens an aperture, 
a window on forever, before 
the nuclear age 
when only a burnt out 
floating of Earth toward Vega, 
after the sun was done, 
was an end so far off 
it couldn't be 
imagined.
when I've grown a green 
kelp sea-green beard. 
Just let me he here by the sea 
in sand beneath 
a constant acclimation of wing to wind 
currents carrying gulls cries 
as a Cormorant cuts across sky 
oh, wake me up 
in a hundred 
years 
when 
I've 
grown a green 
kelp sea-green beard 
among the dunes 
of time and sun 
among the dunes of seaswept runes 
among the dunes of seas and times 
among eternal windswept ryhmes 
among forever singing chimes 
after all the human crimes 
are done.
I have some wild notion of following the birds 
to the rim of the world, 
flinging myself on the spongy turf there 
and drinking forgetfulness 
until roots twine around my knees 
and worm their way deep inside me. 
My mind spills like hot coffee over the saucer 
of my life and drowns in its own dark ecstacy. 

Lulling my pain with the aspirin of death 
taken in small doses nightly, 
I sit beside the fire of your soul, 
glowing flesh in the light, 
never quite awake. 

A match struck behind my eyelids 
flares against my retinas. 
A shadow dance of puppets begins: 
mother, father, child, lover 
whirl in a Chinese lantern show 
until the frenzy that would bum me quickly 
in a puff of ecstasy reels away. 

Spun out in a slow red river of sound 
from the mouth of longing, I used to measure my time 
in monthly cycles, forging a link, a secret transaction 
of modems, voice answering screen. I talk to you as if to 
myself, stammering an answer. I try laboriously to bear 
wheat, voice to breath, tongue to tongue. 

We end as a feather floats from the sky, 
vaults the dark pool of mind, reflecting the moon 
like a woman's buttocks turned up again to heaven.
Yes. It's true. Sugar maples are disappearing. Too 
many chemicals! "The trees, trees, trees" 
are all I want to look at and know, says Jerzey Spacive, 
Hungarian linguist dying of AIDS 
after surviving Nazi Germany's 
camps for Jews. "I can't even listen to music!" 
says he. "I anticipate all the notes 
that fade into nothing. No thrill 
comes from classic sound that used to comfort me. 

Just the sunlight, moonlight, sunset on the trees, 
they're all I want to know, all I see. The trees 
are everything to me. The last sight for all should be of trees, 
Bartlett pear trees, pyrus with their sweet golden fruit 
dropping from thick glossy greenery, pointed leaves 
with fringes folded inward like arms on my breast." 

"Yes, apple trees in the orchard on 
the horizon. Hazelnut, Hickory, 
Poplar, Rock Oak, Blue Spruce, Blue Juniper, 
Red Cedar, Yewberry, Ashberry, 
Red Oak and White Oak, Red Pine and Grey Pine, 
White and Black Birch, 
aromatic Eastern Hemlocks dying of a blight, 
Rare Elms and Douglas Firs, Redwoods 
cut for timber, phenomenal ancient 
Sequoia Gigantia felled for silly furniture. 
Rain forests murdered for grazing meat." 

"A twenty-five percent decline and a loss 
of nearly half of new trees 
over the past thirty years," the forester told me. 
"Synthetic chemicals begin to appear 
in their rings at the dawn 
of the Industrial Revolution -- poisons 
traced to the Ohio River Valley, airborne 
to the Northeastern forests...."

Jerzey murmurs as he slips into his forever sleep: 
"Seeds of the endangered Whitebark Pine of the high Rockies 
are a staple of the grizzly bears, red squirrels, 
and song birds, here, and there. 
The dark green aromatic Hen-docks are falling to an Asian blight, 
wooly adelgid and fiorinia scale, which also invites 
infestation by spider mites, 
and so the Eastern Hemlocks go 
the way of the American Elm from its Dutch Disease, 
and the Chestnuts before them perished, too. 
The trees are going to entropy, acid rain, chemicals and PCBs. 

The trees are all that comfort me. 
They hold all the answers unspoken in their branches. 
Trees make time visible and fragrant, they are our breath 
and breathe with us as we breathe they live 
and we live as they breathe and greed is killing them. 
The trees hold all the answers. 
Ask them. We enter the grove and are changed, 
peace rains down in green over us. Green which holds the mountains 
together with roots, green which scatters lacy shade over us, spins 
out our breath in freshened sips. 
We drink the rain with them. 
Beware, the trees are dying with us. 
Every sapling rises up to breathe with every child in 
its rightful place under the sun, 
set me free 
into the arms of my Copper Beech tree."
In the morning 
there will be sunlight. 
There will be day. 
One evening 
I'll die 
and the sum total of the universe 
will continue. 

I'll erase my ears, eyes, nose, 
tongue, fingers, 
but the continents, mountains, music, 
pyramids will persist. 

Behind me 
the future will accumulate. 
In earth like a man in a woman, 
I'll make food out of food. 

When I see the last sunrise, 
I'll hear the first bird. 
I will everything 
to everyone. 
As we begin our trip 
to Shangri-la, then hope 
that the way is long 
down mountain streams where the water 
is fresh with adventure, 
up pathways to where wisdom gathers 
on mountaintops. Let's not fear 
the nightmares 
sent by xenophobic monsters 
invented by projected greed. 
We will not meet them on our path 
if our spirits are aloof 
and sensual emotions touch 
our bodies 
with each other's hopes. 
Come, swim with me in the cool lake as we age with youth 
and then let's watch the sunsets, red-orange and blue, 
purple as dawn, in our own magical garden 
which borders the gardens of others, 
where we work renewed, never judging the monsters 
we meet in our nightmares. 

Perhaps we'll never greet the Lochness Monster 
or Big Foot, Tyrannosaurus Rex, 
Dracula or black-booted Nazi, 
bigoted Skinhead or exorcising priest 
of exclusive nonsense and gobbledegook,
fierce fascist, or self-righteous fanatic, 
if we refuse them transport, 
if our spirits stay vigilant, watching over 
our body's good work, touch others 
with joy here and now, and forgive and live 
close to the Earth and all her gifts, 
sunsets and rises, apples, 
pears, corn, wheat, rice, 
things that matter to children.
on the autumn pond afloat with shrivelled leaves. 
Nothing stays. 

Feelings in the blood drain 
from the corpse as seeds fall 
beneath dead leaves. 
Love is half of longing. 

When we are together, longing goes 
as a sunset sinks behind a mountain top 
leaving a halo glow. 
Seeds root beneath rotting leaves. 

I must be careful 
not to long for the ache 
of wanting you, to lick the sweetness 
which is gone from me, to miss 
the wish 
which is unfulfilled 
more than savor its repose, 
here, now, 
the sun on the autumn pond, 
an iridescent duck with his mallard brown 
mate amidst the dying leaves, 
lilies still bright with beauty shiver as they go 
into winter, 
thrilling with the cold that will 
come when it will come, 
as necessary as the setting of the sun.
daughter child full grown 
of my very flesh 
into your own 
separate being, 
seeing 
me as free 
from your need of me. 

Now, I need you 
to feel, 
my mother's need of you, 
as I return to the dark 
of my lonely widow's room 
to day dream of your visits 
offering spring flowers 
to my granite tomb.
Stars dance their light 
The night sky shivers. 
Listening to waves, 
dance, my daughter! 

Wind wanders fields 
singing in the wheat. 
Hearing the winds song, 
dance, my daughter. 

Earth spinning holds 
children in her skirts. 
Feeling the moon's hands, 
dance, my daughter. 

Love winning fills 
all with Her power. 
Seeing Her sunrise, 
dance, my daughter. 

Love losing sighs 
in wet wounded eyes. 
Burying my bones, smile 
and dance, my daughter.
I danced with ears in my belly, 
sang songs from a sonorous throat. 
Academicians thought I was crazy. 
Men imagined I was being sexy. 
They sent me foolish invitations 
which lead no where. 
I tore them up laughing. 

As Mirabei, at the shrine of my navel, 
I worshipped the leaves that flowed through me. 
I lived as the symbiotic tree. 
I've dedicated my body and soul 
to the American Demeter. 
I sent Her radiance through rythmic muscles 
out into the universe. 
I worshipped Her redwood forests, Her 
Natural Cathedrals, the fruit of Her fields, 
the labors of Her women, 
Her Indians and immigrants. 

My Goddess was the good Earth. 
I came from Her milk, Her breasts. 
Hypatia gave me the spirit to dance 
with my soul in my belly. 
I smelled Earth's music, heard Her colors, 
tasted Her fire and knew 
the dancer is the dance.

or creatures crawl riding foam to hurry back to salty home, 
as oceans pound fruit to pecking pipers, 
or shells keep tunes in earlike chambers, 
filled with sand and sea to roam 
like songs rejoicing feathered nest and comb 
as warm eggs crack chirping hunger, and a child slithers 
forth to touch, smell, see, hear earthly cries and laughters 
pushed suckling free from nurturing womb -- 

my tongue is loosed beyond a private caroling, my pen prances 
urged by mysterious love as if it had no part in what is sighed 
as Earth sings praises through me, my eyes are green sea, 
red skies, wildflowers, a child who dances 
well when loved beyond the pain of men's tribal wars, pride, 
threatened suicide, and bloody rivalry.
The peach is 
a belly dancer's fruit. 
It has a navel eye for seeing 
the world through the skin, 
rounded buttocks 
good 
to place against the hand 
the way earth reminds flesh 
of its being. 

Through the eye of the needle, 
death is a country 
where people 
wonder 
and worry 
what it's like to live. 

The sullen wish to live 
and live soon 
to be done 
with death 
and the happy 
want 
to stay dead 
forever 
wondering 
will it hurt 
to live 
and is there death 
after 
death?

                If his life had been a novel, he'd have quit
                reading long ago: characters
                unbelievable, plot almost building, to fizzle
                out halfway.  A taunted weakling all
                along, the hero, finally bearing serum to
                a dying child, only falls asleep in
                snow, not even real, but bills, paper.  He
                dreams of no back-slapping heaven of parents
                and wives saying we never thought you
                had it in you.  Not even a dog comes
                nuzzling through at the last, a wounded
                wolf befriended in his youth.  Maybe one
                reader, the child he didn't know
                he had, snowshoeing by.  "Here," he gasps
                pressing the vial into a hand, "Nome.
                Dying."

                Bitter, numb already, you turn
                into the wind.  Your problem now.
                He tells me I'm a risk:
                he is small, blond, Mississippian.  I trust him.
                I am fighting my genes, he says, fighting
                my father at fifty-two pulling off the highway
                that had become a gray blur
                trying to call to anyone from a phone booth
                while it broke in his chest, calcified, knobby
                like an ankle bone
                and then again, over and over
                in the hospital while doctors
                ran up and down the halls trying to stop
                that sequence of explosions,
                that string of firecrackers.

                You see yourself as glass
                for the first time, transparent,
                shaken and fizzing, a bottle
                of soda, and start watching
                for potholes.
                Or maybe you just learn to live
                with a cart with square wheels
                thudding in your breast
                trying to carry whatever it is
                there,
                before it's too late.

                This is how to become
                old -- worry only
                about yourself.
                So that if there come
                bombs out of clouds
                or lovers into rooms, saying
                goodbyes, learn
                how to cup your hand around it, as if
                in a world of wind
                there is this one candle
                that must be saved.
                I pried them from baseball
                bats, made them learn my
                lines, sell tickets,
                and we swept the red
                dirt of our dank
                cellar, strung a curtain
                (shower), lit stolen
                candles, called it
                a tragedy.

                Somewhere halfway through
                the plot began to improvise
                itself, a flock of script taking
                wing, the spear (rake)
                used on the wrong end.
                A wooden sword cleft
                the gray loaf of yellow
                jackets who descended like
                critics, the plastic curtain
                sizzled black fog.

                As I rounded the dogwood,
                mother after me
                with the rake/spear, I looked
                back and decided to go
                into poetry:
                a frieze, a tableau -- Jimmy
                Jacobs, his cape a still
                attached and whirling
                muleta to Poochie
                the dog, had delicate
                blond Joe Nelson, who would
                die at ten, in a headlock,
                the basement behind spewing
                ash and smoke, a sacked
                city, bees swirling
                around them like golden
                snow in a crystal ball.
                Waxing the car, I straighten up, old
                in the back, rag in hand, remembering
                suddenly for some reason Grant
                Park, its deep hills, a zoo, cyclorama
                with one slumped soldier half plaster, half
                paint, his leg stumps blotted with flaking
                blood, the world around misted with cannon
                smoke, buzzards, burned pines arrowed in
                the sides of Atlanta's red wound, invisible
                choirs humming Dixie. Where my
                mother took watermelons, busted
                and ate them with either my father
                or a sailor named Faris, where her
                club met the time they hurt her
                feelings and she dragged me out of the marble
                pavilion to drive around awhile and cry
                and they all hugged when we came back.
                At reunions aunts wore membrane thin
                flower dresses, gray buns, witches'
                shoes, and uncles brown suits, snap
                brim hats, badges and blackjacks. They
                fried chicken, took black boys to
                the icehouse, went to war, came home, died.
                I can smell them like a seance -- chicken,
                sawdust, talcum, gunpowder.  And car wax.
                Did my parents drive there on
                Sundays after the war?  With me asleep
                in a picnic basket or in her did we
                polish an old car under the trees as if
                we all had forever?  I'll never know now.
                Tonight they're running it again:
                I ran in the back yard for days yelling
                "Shane!  Come back Shane!" after I
                saw it, and just remembered where:
                we'd leave the house to get there
                before dark, cool at night in the summer
                and I cried quietly, mosquitoes and voices
                in the back seat with me,
                where I saw "The Thing"
                huge and strong, vegetable, almost
                unkillable.

                Those were the good old days before
                I got disconnected, like Alan Ladd only
                far less fast or blonde,
                more like James Arness, stranded and vicious,
                bleeding dust when cut.

                He wore a buckskin shirt and went
                away because he loved his best friend's
                wife. When they found him
                under the ice, my hair
                rose as they held hands and spread
                out across the snow, making a hushed
                circle of that shape, everything
                I ever wanted to be inside.
                He laughed at her, saying
                "But I'm already in hell."
                She said, "All right," angry,
                "you remember the cabin up
                at the creek, when we'd all go and
                Opal and Tommie would be there and all
                the kids, and we'd go dancing every night?
                Well that's what heaven is.
                And we'll all be there," she shouted, "and you
                WON'T."  He opened his mouth
                as if she'd slapped him back
                for all those times he'd hit
                his only child with a butcher's hand
                hard as a bed slat.

                He was mean as a snake
                when he was young, she said
                meaning drunk, beating up black
                men in the ice house, braining a
                cuckold with a ketchup bottle
                like his grandfather, the general
                who said the only good Indian
                was a dead Indian.  I remember him first
                a mile high, putting in
                his dentures, a pink snail curled on
                a row of pearls, sliding it in
                and biting with a wet "chuck"
                looking down and saying
                "You Irishman, you."

                He joined the next week as the choir
                sang "Just As I Am," and mother,
                crying, dragged me behind her
                after him down the aisle, went
                every Sunday after, driving slowly
                home, the cars lined up for miles
                on the two-lane road behind
                his stories as if he didn't
                hear the curses and the horns.

                His black neighbor found him
                in the yard, a small purple
                stain at the white temple.
                In the hospital clear tubes made sounds
                like a straw at the bottom of a cup
                and he held my hand
                hard.  When she touched him asking
                "And who is this?" he snuffled out
                words, eyes closed: "That's my
                baby," his mouth said, empty, drawn
                like a purse.

                She still dreams about him
                all the time: a little girl
                again, lying in the cabin at night she hears
                a band far away playing the "Down Home Rag"
                till the music dies to nothing,
                and a fog begins to grow.
                Somehow human at last
                his face rises from the blue mist
                of the night woods and calls her his baby
                above the sound of rushing water.
                The summer Del
                Shannon had a hit with "Runaway"
                I was failing algebra, and my
                grandfather told the story about slugging
                his English teacher, jumping out
                the window to run away and work
                for the railroad, and eventually have mother
                who had me.

                Clark Goswick and I, on the last
                day of school, before report cards
                came in the mail, left
                for Daytona Beach
                to work on fishing boats and marry
                Cuban girls, but a cop caught us
                after only two miles and four hours.
                As we walked up the driveway, bleeding, our backpacks
                solid with canned beans and bristling with fishing
                rods, mother called from the porch
                "Did they let school out early?"

                When I fall across my desk
                stricken, teaching
                "The Road Not Taken" for the thousandth time
                an old salt on a dock somewhere
                in Florida will be splicing
                rope and telling yarns
                to the dark children
                of children.
                There's this circle of orange
                earth, the runner having to get
                across.  The coach slammed the ball
                at me, who looked up and saw
                Joe, the biggest and meanest in the third
                grade, in the middle grinning.  I still see my
                running, in Christmas football pants, legs in
                my mind moving faster than any
                boy's ever, fly's wings, the ball
                across my breast like a Bible.

                On the other side, amazed, I looked
                back to see him kicking dirt, hating
                me with his teeth.  I trotted to the
                coach, handed him the ball like a star
                and woke up face down, laughter in
                the air like dust, clotting in my
                mouth and eyes, coach over me, his
                hand on Joe's shoulder, saying
                way to go.  Don't you NEVER quit.

                I replay it all the time, only
                egging Joe on, blindside the kid
                in the red pants.  And more:
                kick him while he's down, already
                learning on the ground how there's
                really only one
                emotion: huge, sitting
                in the center, all
                the deadly sins, and virtues,
                shame and love, hate and
                pride, patience, greed, envy, even
                revenge just
                legs.
                I learned early what that verse
                meant, "For now we see as through a glass
                darkly."  My mother wouldn't buy me any
                glasses because then I'd be a foureyes
                maybe even play in the band like the rest
                of the pansies, or like my father, polishing
                his lenses, head bent, hands
                before his face as if
                praying, no football
                hero.  Teachers tired of my leaning
                in from the front row, chalk dust in
                my hair, begged her in notes: like the blind
                man in the Bible miracle, he sees men
                as trees, and trees as lime
                jello.  Going out for passes, I was
                lost like the end of the world when
                everybody running sees the sky but me.
                The coach threw his hat in the dust, "Son,
                have you EVER caught a pass?" I never
                did, but when she gave in, let me have
                my specs, it was like heaven, she even more
                beautiful with wrinkles, people gross
                as bears now limber as hickory, spare
                as willows.  And the trees, firmed up,
                erect at last, were like emerald fish
                with each scale whole and succinct,
                as if they would never, ever drop a leaf
                or a pass.
                At the end she'd wake
                to find him kneeling, head
                on her lap.  You're working yourself
                to death, she'd say; he, if I
                didn't have you to come home
                to, I'd blow my brains
                out.  Thirty years they snarled, circled
                a bone, sometimes me, some
                days my sister, or money.  If you
                were a real man was on our coat
                of arms, with never marry and
                there is no happiness, Nullus Felicitas
                Est.

                So I crave sorrow
                like home cooking, need
                to walk an aisle between
                people dressed for it,
                someone in white
                robes and blood red emblems saying
                words over it, the dead mailing
                lead crystal, cut glass doorknobs
                that don't fit for as long
                as we both shall live.
                When my father died my mother and I got
                drunk every night, told each other
                secrets, why I really left my wife
                that he cut the tips out of all her
                bras, why he wouldn't go fishing all
                those mornings, on the beach together
                with a Polaroid while I slept.  He left her
                nothing, like that old joke, she laughed
                I've got money enough for the rest
                of my life, if I die tomorrow.  At the funeral
                the preacher said I know how much you'll miss
                him.  How much I'll miss it, she said. He thought
                she meant money, I thought the house she would
                lose, the cooking and polishing she loved, but
                she meant "it," like in novels and poetry about dead
                lovers, how everything apparently ends
                and you're left like her the day after, or him
                the day before, swallowing tablets, stalling, pouring
                foam on their burning hearts, both of them with enough
                pain to last until they died, if they never did.              
                Castles of red brick in the rain, where my
                "Granny" was, who thought the jets flew over
                to take pictures of her clothesline of old
                panties.  Things she said made
                the newspapers: "There," she'd
                say, triumphant, "I TOLD you they were
                listening." From the fireplace.  She could stay
                there till death, or they could cut, a fifty
                fifty chance, the first one.  Downstairs
                at night my father shouted against his
                sisters.  "Be it on YOUR head then," they said.

                He took us to see her, maybe the last
                time, walking into old light
                like yellow dust, lampshades, cracked green
                walls, a room of sofas and steel bars.
                She cried and called him Billy, a
                child, "Take me home."  I looked just
                like him, her Billy.  She wore a flimsy
                flower print, for Sunday, black shoes like a
                witch's, pointed bun of white hair.  Somewhere way
                off inside there was groaning, other crying.

                Your parents always said, "If you don't behave
                we'll send you to Milledgeville."  Now I know
                it was real, where Flannery O'Connor lived
                with her mother and peacocks that called
                like souls at dusk, remember how we
                left her sobbing out "lobotomy" all
                the way back down the hall, and the next
                day, how it showed up in all the papers.
                When we hit that highway in Jacksonville
                a veil parted into an otherness five hundred
                miles and ten days from August's red
                dirt, scrub pine and football
                practice, where my mother wanted
                an athlete, and the coach wanted a state
                championship. Skinny, timid,
                I just wanted a stay of execution
                mixed of crushed bleached shells
                and tar, blown and puddled with white
                sand, running all the way down the coast just
                behind one long dune, a green rampart
                of sea oats and Spanish bayonet, Florida's
                groves of water oak and olive even
                at noon black, clustered, gnarled
                Greek women whispering together, shade
                caves of rusted cutlasses, eye patches, pieces
                of eight falling spangled through twigs
                onto the rooted gray sand carpeted with brown
                scalloped leaves.
                Fronds rattled all night in the salt wind
                and neon palms blinked red, green
                red, green.  Motels, Moorish, Tahitian, flashed
                vacancy, their hula girls flickering hips back
                and forth, the boardwalk over the beach
                pouring pastel candy cotton, apple smells
                and the heavy oil of hamburgers, onions
                corn dogs, boiled crabs. The screaming rides
                calliopes, drowned the hissing of the surf.
                Every morning we drove, our car full
                of coffee steam and canned milk, to the pier
                stilted out over the green waves, its boards
                strewn with translucent pink confetti, bits,
                baby fingernails of shrimp shell and fish scale,
                cobbles of lead sinkers crusted with salt, snarled
                blond nests of old nylon line. We never caught
                anything, but the whole ocean was always there
                in case. And the fishing camp muffled with stained
                sawdust, where we watched the throbbing boats
                come in, throw colored bowed fish, sliding
                in ice slime onto the dock, a shark
                hanging on a hook, its gray bark
                I reached out to touch with one finger
                a dark deep-sea pool with fins
                gliding, giant turtle that raised its beaked
                head to pshaw spray into the warm air above
                where we walked across a wooden bridge afraid
                we were falling through the cracks. It was
                always there, summer after summer the
                same until that last year riding in on the first
                day, there all along, one thing too
                many, a field bulldozed free
                of palms and palmetto, where they practiced
                football, the year I noticed that the blue
                scrolled sign of our motel, the Shangra La,
                was spelled without an "i."
                Every Saturday he was bent
                over the plastic voice of our
                radio, the kitchen filling down
                with the blue smoke of Camels,
                oiled black curls falling
                through the thin fingers that held
                his brow.  They were losing
                again, where they taught about
                flying, or building the planes.
                But his Welsh father would only pay
                for a seminary, until there was
                mother, then the war, then me.
                While I grew up in his father's house
                he delivered telegrams, sometimes
                on campus, came back and told me how
                they all wore yellow satin jackets
                and sliderules on their belts.
                Or went and sat alone at night
                above the grain yellow rink
                he was tall enough to play in.
                When only one college
                would take me, tiny, far
                from home, "No. That's real
                good," he said. "They always
                lose." Which meant to him
                they only took the best.
                Preachers spend half their lives in empty
                churches, stopping by with their sons
                on the way downtown to ball games.  I hear his voice
                far off, echoing, muffled in a small room below --
                he's stained with violet ink, cursing
                the mimeograph machine, or the folder
                that mangles paper.  In the pitiful
                library, I look at Michelangelo's women,
                cracked sepia breasts, plump
                pears between their thighs, the finger
                of naked Adam reaching out to God.

                The summer janitor at thirteen,
                I swept the hundred rooms of concrete
                floors, metal chairs, shredded hymnals,
                gray window light, the silence of stone.
                On the block walls were palm
                trees letting down spears
                of light and Jesus drinking with the woman
                at the well, walking on water, pointing
                to his own heart.  I dreamed of Brenda
                Wilkie, underneath her white choir robe.

                In my worst dreams I'm stranded
                halfway between that red brick, city church
                and home as the sun begins to set.
                I can remember all the turns the car
                used to make to get back into the suburbs,
                but I'm walking and get lost, wander up
                ever more branching roads into the hills past
                the tangled cemetery where my grandmother
                lies, into those neighborhoods where night
                always falls on crumbled roads twisting
                among houses with high
                grass and all the windows dark.
                This is the grave where I buried my
                father, as if he could see blue        
                Kennesaw over there, where Johnston
                dug in like a gentleman to have it
                out, the big gundown, a duel.  Sherman just
                marched around him, cut him off, on
                to Atlanta to burn.  It grew back over, a
                skin, a fur of honeysuckle and kudzu I could
                grow in.  Now each subdivision's
                named something station or
                landing, Civil War chic, new highways
                squirming, red earth sucked to
                the top and bleeding in the rain, that
                K-Mart there in the hill's side as if
                gouged by cannon, the boom of traffic.
                Other than onion rings at The Varsity,
                Brunswick stew at Old Hickory,
                nothing beside remains, though I dream
                my father, on summer nights, ringed
                with shopping centers, sits in the cool
                grass, feels the yellow ghost of honeysuckle, watches
                flares and campfires up on the mountain
                like fireflies, the besieged still holding
                out, praying o
                city that murders my prophets, o
                blue general with fire
                come home.      
                I see the small, boy figure of Gwilym, my
                grandfather, consumptive, climbing out
                of Wales, over and past these gray, bouldered
                hills, away from the black dust toward London
                then onto a ship around the world. Pieces
                are missing, how a cabin boy became
                a cowboy in Australia, came to lay
                rails in America, ending up
                in Georgia's mountains, Methodist
                circuit rider, why aeronautics engineering
                wasn't good enough for Bill his son
                who wanted to fly, that he must become
                another preacher.

                He rebelled too late, a grounded
                accountant marking the soaring of other
                people's money, his crisp two's and
                five's a flock of geese, flight
                of arrows, checks down the long columns.
                At forty he became a preacher so old and self
                taught no church would have him, one voice
                without a wilderness.  Don't make my
                mistake, he said, start early.

                At thirty-five I come back
                to Wales, coal mines gone, to
                wonder if we're meeting, knowing
                ourselves for the first time, strangers
                sharing only a weak chin, small
                mouth and name, or joined deeper
                by an endless ability to hope
                making all three of us lost together.
                There are only a few left, he says,
                kept by old Welsh miners, souvenirs, like
                gallstones or gold teeth, torn
                from this "pit," so cold and wet my
                breath comes out a soul up
                into my helmet's lantern
                beam, anthracite walls running,
                gleaming, and the floors iron-rutted
                with tram tracks, the almost pure
                rust that grows and waves like
                orange moss in the gutters of water
                that used to rise and drown.
                He makes us turn all lights off, almost
                a mile down.  While children scream
                I try to see anything, my hand touching
                my nose, my wife beside me -- darkness palpable,
                a velvet sack over our heads, even the glow
                of watches left behind.  This is where
                they were born, into this nothing, felt
                first with their cold noses for the shaggy
                side and warm bag of black
                milk, pulled their trams for twenty
                years through pitch, past birds
                that didn't sing, through doors
                opened by five-year-olds who sat
                in the cheap, complete blackness listening
                for steps, a knock.  And they
                died down here, generation after
                generation. The last one, when it
                dies in the hills, not quite blind, the mines
                closed forever, will it die strangely?  Will it
                wonder dimly why it was exiled from the rest
                of its race, from the dark flanks of the soft
                mother, what these timbers are that hold up
                nothing but blue?  If this is the beginning
                of death, this wind, these stars?
                I'd never be that
                way, white-haired and prophetic
                stern as Solomon, with full pockets.
                He'd bend over and out would fall
                pens.  He'd pick them up and his
                notebooks would drop, then
                the tiny green Bible. He'd
                bend to pick them up and out would fall
                pens.  Good night alive, he'd shout
                almost a saint except for
                the squatting mimeograph machine
                his own pockets
                and his son.

                And mother liked James Dean, so for years
                it was easy: long hair, leather
                jackets, guitars, anything
                he wasn't.  Until things began
                to fall.  I made sure they were
                cigarettes, small airline
                liquor bottles, prophylactics
                switchblades.

                Graying, I bent groaning today in the new
                asphalt street to tie my
                hushpuppy: the ball of ice
                cream tilted out, then the ball
                point pens, then another ragged
                poem.  I stood with an empty cone
                in the center of the littered black
                street and said God
                damn him, and tried to mean it.
                I'd been there before, knew when I stepped
                off the plane, a hick, into the air-conditioned
                air.  There was smog, yes, but something
                else, a tang -- eucalyptus, burning
                brush in the sun, a cool musk blowing
                off a northern sea that the folds of the desert
                hills poured into, congealing like lava.  The freeways
                bald and ugly, rolled themselves by blue
                waves flecked with the jade pods of kelp, cold
                brine and a beach the color of flesh.  At evening
                crepe myrtle, mimosa, hibiscus, frangipani trailed
                tentacles, scarlet cupped, and the scent of warm
                sage, shades of conquistadors in pewter,
                boulevards of heron-crested palms leaned
                in, all my movies, Saturday matinees, confused:
                Tom Mix zinging bullets off of boulders just
                over the hill from the beast with a million
                eyes, giant ants and the San Andreas
                fault, a lavender stain of sand sliding
                quietly south by San Jacinto like a mountain
                of the moon.  The radio sifted the air
                for a song, "Riders On the Storm," the notes
                flickering stars above Mount Palomar,
                a crowd with candles shouting jump
                to someone on a ledge, white-robed
                congregations at night in blind canyons, lights
                of L.A., a pond of phosphorescent motes seen
                from mountains of coyotes, howling.

                I told no one my vision -- the earth dirty
                dangerous and holy -- except once:
                a group laughing on the beach,
                brown, wet with oil and floured with sand.
                They loved my accent and made me say it over
                and over, like a cowboy star of the thirties
                or something from another world.
                That old cracked couple down the street
                could be Adam and Eve, still, the way
                they tend their fat acre, or the Poe
                story, keeping death out: ramparts of
                azalea, jonquil pikes, corner spumes
                of white dogwood. Maybe death will NEVER
                win, their rich thumbs sprout, grass
                swarm over the mound of grave. So why
                are they afraid? They see it as smut, a mildew,
                something that shows up in
                place of the milkman, sniffing all the
                color from their flowers, slobbering
                all over the jade shrubs, peeing a
                stain in brown runnels of blight through
                the veins and arteries of their tough
                St. Augustine. They even keep its runners
                in, stack their gritty borders with concrete
                block lest something park and watch.
                From their glass breakfast porch they
                would hold each other, shaking free
                fists at it, they way they cross to the
                other side when they pass my rented yard
                with its plastic chair among the dead
                leaves, broken limbs and bicycles
                in the shadow of the shaggy copper
                beech that has been rust from the beginning.                    
                On the road past Lake Serene, someone
                has torn down the bridge out
                sign, and while pickups doze in the blacktop
                lots of shouting south Mississippi
                churches, we drive on across concrete
                spillways, our tires hushed in water,
                looking at the mansions and the leaves
                until we come to the new bridge of broken
                white wafers down in the red gorge
                the lake seeps through to become a stream
                again.

                Since we have to stop
                anyway, we get out to look for pine cones
                to fill Christmas baskets. Fresh
                fallen from the storm last night they're
                hard, unopened, pink as flesh, long
                thin pineapples. Like crusts of bread
                they lead us along the bluff, layered
                like orange desert cliffs, and around
                to the lake, the shallow end away
                from the yachts and boat docks, to where
                mud has cracked in autumn's low water.

                Now a grid of slick gray tiles
                furred with evergreen lies beneath
                clear water only inches deep.  Mussels,
                fat brown parabolas etched with rings
                like trees, bubble between the cracks.
                On the shore, in sand, we see tracks of
                raccoon, watching us from the pine
                dark woods, and the shells they've
                beaten open with both paws and left
                in the sun to be pearl butterflies
                everywhere. Out in the lagoon, navy,
                rippled with the cold north wind, are
                thousands of logs, stumps, each
                knobbed with turtles.

                Back at the car we thump
                the pine cones into the trunk
                and open a mussel, part the thin
                lips to show us something inside:
                wet, soft, curled like a small
                tongue of glycerin and amber.
                I'm taking apart a packing
                crate in the back yard, building
                a bookcase of the pieces, hoping
                my wife will come back and see
                what I was, though I've told her
                often enough.  It must be the smell
                of pine, the scraps we burned
                in barrels, shivering, climbing in the
                morning out of the purple shadow up
                on that beached skeleton of yellow
                bones, the heaped mud below us flecked
                with nails, into the parallel gold
                bars of sun above the trees, slippery
                rime on the boards, glistening
                snail tracks, until the sun
                thawed it to damp the wood a shade
                darker, pulpy as stale bread
                to the nails, ringing slightly when
                you let the hammer do the work, if
                you're good, just lifting it
                to fall, going in deep with one
                blow, the boards blond as women, lime
                streaked with grain, powdered with the fine
                dust our saws give off into the morning
                like pollen. Splinters, and drops
                of blood like blots of rust. Insects
                grow louder as the sun rises. We
                throw aluminum cans of water
                underarmed, lateraled like
                footballs, silver bullets twirling, throwing
                off curls of the water that tastes
                like sugar, metal cold in the throat.

                She comes around the house bringing lemonade
                and stays to watch.  I begin to tell the story again
                as things start to bend and tear.
                I begin to sweat, saying
                I used to ...
                do this ...
                for a living
                but my story, like this project
                is going nowhere, and she yawns.
                Your stories go nowhere
                too, I say, the famous
                England trip, hiking in the Rockies,
                the alleged year you spent as a waitress, you,
                who've broken every dish in the house.
                But she just laughs and goes
                back in.

                Now the nails straighten again
                by themselves and sink into the wood
                forever, shining, hidden.
                They make fun of our spoiling her, felt
                catnip toys, canned escargot, a tiny
                wine list.
                But her forerunner got hit chasing
                squirrels in the street because we wanted her
                to be free, happy, the one we raised
                by hand with a doll's bottle she sucked
                and chewed, her blind mouth brimming
                with evaporated milk.  She made a nest
                in my hair at night, and I had fleas
                for months, long after she was dead.

                This one wears a harness and leash
                she drags around the yard all day
                like a small, abandoned sled dog.
                Most of the time she just sits, miserable
                humiliated, as if she's being forced to wear
                a hat.  We keep a broomstick
                handy for dogs and snakes.

                They only live ten or twelve years
                anyway, at the most,
                but we want to bury her wrinkled
                arthritic, bored
                though she sits for hours thinking, scheming
                of a breakout, dreaming
                of mice and trashcans
                hating our guts.

                We could care less: we don't
                philosophize
                anymore -- we just
                patrol.
                "But I don't love HIM.  I love
                YOU."  I turned to see her
                within the morning shade of a small
                tree, standing as if she'd just
                stamped her foot, arms crossed, holding
                together her trembling yellow dress.
                His head was bowed.  They were being
                miserable, but o what
                misery.  The butler, I walked
                on.  Hadn't heard a thing.

                Though it's still warm, fall
                has begun, the sun already
                slanting in the afternoon, flaring
                the brick buildings orange and gold, one
                or two leaves turning early, here a dot
                of russet, mauve.  The evenings are
                sentimental, smells of woodsmoke and something
                invisible just beginning, blooming
                too late.  Hearing winter, sick
                cats push at my window tonight
                to be fed, broken-winged birds
                struggle out in the dark, fish with
                eyes hooked sink, their scales releasing
                the summer moon.  Wounded things
                begin to ache before it snows and all
                the books I've ever read weigh tons,
                and that's outside the mind.
                I've never been this far above
                the earth as now returning to the city
                of my birth. Far off to the south out
                the plate glass window of the fifty-seventh
                floor, the red brick project where I was
                conceived, across the street the college
                my father couldn't afford, the jade pool
                of football field where I sold cokes.  How
                appropriate it would be to die here on this
                brief and single visit above it all, remember
                fires on T.V., hotels like this burning like
                matches, all smoke alarms and sprinklers
                no comfort.  I imagine air bags like biscuits
                down in the street, if I could hit one, aim
                straight enough, have the courage to
                jump and live, or die.  Before sleep I pray:
                for the one I left for no good reason, that I don't
                fall, for the two orphans my sister adopted then
                gave up when she left her husband, if they're still
                out there somewhere below me in the dark, three
                of the lights theirs.  To sleep I imagine catching
                passes, but feel no earth beneath my feet only
                the hum of this tower in wind, dream only of
                falling.  As I dress to go home, dawn
                reddens the city like a dig in Pompeii so that I
                could step out into it, kneel and brush with one
                finger from the streets between cinnamon
                roofs red dust to find within one brick doll's house
                my mother, still curled on her first bed afraid
                that if she gets up the seed won't
                take.  I pull from my coat the long
                blond hair of my wife remembering
                Lawrence's mother, how her one white strand floated
                up the chimney into nothing.  From my pants
                I brush the short gray hairs from my own
                head, the pale banded filaments of cats.
                They all float down to the floor
                of the fifty-seventh floor.  Outside
                clouds are forming, coming toward me as if
                I were one of them, one of those souls
                that fly up like clouds out of the dead, or the just
                beginning to be.
                I was a child again.
                In the park a girl
                with blond hair watched only
                me.  I could tell she loved me.
                Dream children are lamed so
                they can't follow you home,

                but I got lost, ankles in
                sawdust when the barker stopped me, towering
                above, pointing to the tent side painted
                with the giraffe people, the woman rose
                tattooed, then the green tiny
                earth in a blue pond circled by some
                kind of blond bird on a string.  Blood
                red caption: Mandolin Music in Space!
                You flew my kite.  Blood
                red silk formed a rose,
                the green stem a tail.
                It nodded in the wind all day,
                a lily tethered in a stream
                I watched until dark when

                passion made us grow: lying
                in grass we strained lips, limbs like
                giraffes for leaves, twined
                necks, became
                a tower on the hill.  Silence
                haunted this desire,
                though ghosts, wind, and the wings
                of birds whispered.
                They are splayed in front of me
                like a new hand of cards, thirty
                each bending to the topic, the major
                problem facing college
                freshmen, and I wonder what
                on earth I would write, probably
                remember first the second
                semester, chosen to room with the one
                they all adored, filling
                the shower with guitar chords
                and steam, sitting up on the gravel
                roof and watching cars from the late
                shift at the quarry go home, running
                naked to steal honeysuckle from
                the dean's bush and piling it high
                on the desk we never used, the others
                coming by just to smell it, closing
                back the door without a word until
                it faded, brown tendrils limp, jade
                leaves dusty, the window open in the spring
                afternoon blowing scent and cream flowers
                down the hall.  Singing hits all night
                "The Bright Elusive Butterfly of Love,"
                "Did You Hear the Lonesome Whipporwill,"
                sleepers beating time on our walls, the house
                mother almost crying, you've got to stop singing
                that bird song.  We laughed at her
                and swaggered off through half a year.

                But of the first I would write only of
                my father leaving me there, a room
                in a house so dark I dreamed
                only of death, hiding in the basement
                of the dorm, and then home at
                Christmas, riding to the hospital, moaning
                over and over, not she doesn't
                love me anymore, but "alone"
                over and over, surprised
                as if this was all I'd learned
                or how people only love the people
                they won't let themselves have
                or that from out of where you cut your
                arms what there is of you to hurt
                passes forever like blood leaving
                white tubes that don't need anything
                just to go on writing how I somehow
                still sit each night on top of that house
                watching the night shift wind like pairs
                of stars down that hill, around
                that house that is alone, on the hill
                that is still alone in that country
                on this same old earth that always
                hangs in the night until it's time
                to hand these papers in and go home.
                Four hours from the city
                is a way through the first forest.
                Within a tunnel of trees
                moccasins and oxen hooves
                walked it down until the land around
                makes walls laced with roots.
                Paved with leaves the road
                dips to cross streams pebbled
                like separate trails we walk
                in all directions, barely
                wetting our feet.  We
                see raccoon tracks two
                by two, the twin blades of shy
                deer spoor, red squirrels boring
                deep into the boles of trees turning
                gold, fogged blue in the morning
                with the smoke of the hardwood
                fires of our waking, shivering
                to pack up and go.
                Tomorrow the leaves will be one shade
                brighter, changing all the cold night
                for us, at home, angry again.
                We were camping.  He
                came out of the woods, thin, scarred
                shivering as he walked. We fed him
                spaghetti, salami, stale
                bread he ate till almost dead and buried
                the rest, knowing winter, how
                no one comes to sleep by the lake.

                We found wood to burn in a grove
                of oak, cut and left to rot.
                He stayed in darkness, beyond the fire.
                Headlights came at midnight, halloing.
                He cowered as if the voice were over him
                with a stick. We kept
                quiet, hiding, but the pickup
                came down, asking about a liver-spotted
                hound.  Seeing the twelve-gauge, we said no
                dog here.
                When we left he ran after us
                partway up the road.

                Today it is full winter, gray and drizzling, even
                up on that acre of rotting trees, on that
                lake where no one comes but hunters
                calling home their dogs.
                I stalk the nature trail
                trying to see deer
                or even a rabbit.
                The leaves still wet
                I creep like moccasins
                when suddenly I hear
                something coming
                on the trail ahead.
                Had I a rifle
                I'd have shot a young
                doppelganger, red bandannaed.
                He says as we pass
                you think you're alone out here?
                You've got a surprise coming
                about a hundred yards up.

                About a hundred yards up
                a hundred boy scouts are waking
                screaming, chasing through the woods
                casting lures into trees
                burning bacon.
                A scoutmaster, mounty cap crooked
                on his head
                sits wrapped in a khaki blanket
                his face sleeping in his hands while
                green and yellow tents sag everywhere
                radios twang and clumsy
                fires pour up blue smoke.
                I used to beg my mother
                to let me join, go on these trips,
                but she thought I was too frail.
                Old as the scoutmaster
                I am finally learning to camp
                dreaming in my tent of grizzlies
                burning my fingers
                chopping my feet.

                I see one trying to fill
                a plastic jug with a two-handed pump.
                He looks alone here, not a member
                of anybody's gang.
                I hold the jug like a
                scoutmaster would while he
                pumps and tells me about the hike
                they took yesterday so long even
                MY feet begin to ache.
                We fill the jug, look
                at his blisters,
                tighten up his tent and then
                sit down by his smudge of fire.
                Glad of the company
                he offers me black bacon
                and a slice of toast
                spread with cold butter
                and ashes like pepper.

                When I leave he goes to show
                the way I'd lost, pointing
                from the fork we come to
                and is still there, smaller
                standing in a spot of sun
                at the first bend before I go
                into the deepest part of the woods.
                Fishing, our lanterns hung just
                above the slick black water made
                holes filled with fish, squirming
                eels in a barrel of yolk.
                Offshore, the oil rigs crouched,
                steel mosquitoes, their needles
                syphoning out the long dead
                and fishing boats inside the reef
                illegally, running lights off
                used the moon instead rising
                red and swollen through air sifted
                with volcanic ash.
                Dolphins in the bay circled and charged
                again and again with ivory teeth
                into the shoals of trout
                busy snapping minnows and shrimp
                on the surface, and sometimes
                our hooks that
                snagged them up to beat
                off their scales on the loose
                gravel of the bridge
                with the bloody moon rising
                over hooks and nets everywhere, things
                leaping into hoops of light appearing
                almost glad to die.
                Each day they try to hold the island
                that's moving, folding, crawling like an octopus
                back to mainland.  Finger paring, it's dissolving
                to the invisible quick.  Bulldozer noise is a
                surf, choppers hover with the gulls.
                The beach is fished out this year from
                mud-dredge and a hard freeze.  Up here
                on the night bridge fewer than ever come
                to lanterns pasting a jade ball on the tidal
                river, hanging mosquitoes for minnows, then shrimp
                flipping for trout: first the first of their
                flash, then shades weaving the falling tide
                someone down the bridge, their bending down
                face, reflected yellow moon, whispering there
                they are, here rising, here sperm
                squirming in a yolk, snapping foam.  They
                hover, seem to be swimming like hounds ran
                back when there were foxes, if you caught in
                helicopter searchlight their streaming from
                the spool, forming, flattening to take a
                hedge, thinning like water through rocks
                spinning filaments through trees, resuming
                the skein on the other side, not running but
                riding land-flow beneath.  This is how they
                hold the tide, though the rigs offshore
                flare their gas-burn wells, illegal black-boats
                drag their trawls, how they will come back
                every night to our lamps for years
                even when they is only one left
                or one light left to come to.
                It's New Orleans but it isn't.
                There's no heat, no black mud levee
                just cool jade grass declining
                to the clear Mississippi, cobalt
                blue flowing so shallow over sand
                that we can wade across.
                And trees everywhere, but no houses
                only small grocery stores in the groves
                of water oak, in the shade of Spanish moss
                with formica tables where old friends
                can sit and drink beer
                who haven't seen each other for years.
                Some of us are even dead
                so that we could easily cry
                about this last chance
                except we're shy and speak only
                of how much weight we've lost
                how good we still look.

                We know we are only dreaming
                have met in a nexus of time and night
                so why, as we talk, explain, apologize, do we
                smile with a secret, as if
                summoned to this heaven by
                our need for each other again
                as if one of us sent out a call?
                By the river on the night of the twenty-fifth
                and don't be late.
                You were born into it, certitude, like the air
                you came into, waiting to breathe, the lemon
                color of your hair, the teeth you assumed.
                Everything after fell in line -- a white horse
                high stepping to Gary Owen," a wife
                who needed you like bread, the eyes               
                of a country. You knew -- looking
                at women, drawing a bead, or an ace,
                but unsatisfied, itchy, there was still a catch
                a skip, still in the breast, a
                stutter, priming your heart, turning
                the head at odd moments, expecting
                a door, something to enter, go through.
                And then you saw your first indian
                and finally showed that famous smile
                everything around you dead.
                I've been there when five
                have tied a game, pistol
                hands going off, revolution,
                emotion rising to the dome like fog, tear
                gas, red ants swarming.

                Only tenors and athletes get that
                instant backwash, echo of greatness
                slapped from a cliff face
                back, the ball, high C
                going through touching nothing
                at all.

                What about Keats then, just
                after, say, the Grecian
                Urn, nobody, nothing but a sagging
                candle, there that late. Old
                silence.  Or maybe the sound when
                silence is shifted one cog over
                by a poem, as though you'd turned
                the wheel left, went right
                and for a second
                where are you?

                As if the wrought iron bench,
                beneath you in the sunny side-
                walked, bird, bicycle, new
                leaved, skates and flowered
                park, its lion paws set
                in warm concrete that twines steel
                tap roots down, were
                by a single thought just
                ever so slightly
                moved.                                                  
                I stopped praying years ago, learned how
                to think instead of love, or the icy mountains before
                death, green fields beyond.  Now I need
                a quiet god, not to make the heart rattle,
                a golf ball in a cup.  Baseball fits best,
                almost as if designed in sleep:  the pickoff, brush
                back, squeeze, suicide squeeze, stealing.  It's no
                heaven -- it's here: slick skin and stitches of the ball
                in hand reminding me of Ebba St. Claire, Atlanta
                Cracker catcher built like crossed trees, showing us
                how to throw, the ball an egg in the knotted
                roots of his fingers. If he never made it, how
                can we?  Yet I wear before sleep the welts
                and wrinkles of a glove, dream hand, grip the bone
                handle of a Louisville Slugger, slap clay
                from my spikes and go toward the dark as to
                home, playing for the bunt, the sacrifice.
                Before this happened, God
                was something inside, familiar, warm
                as an organ. Now it's far
                away, white-haired and thunderous,
                a dirt dam I plug stormy nights
                on my knees that sickness won't
                balloon into death, that accidents
                swerve and carom around us, the vessel
                in my wife won't burst, my heart
                get sulky and tired, the wrong woman
                show up.

                All good tragedies are those of
                love, and therefore God, inside of us
                yet still outside, like dreams
                of dams bursting overhead, tornadoes
                circling, things, rising from dark
                swamps, red eyed, taloned, coming closer.
                We see her in the K-Mart housewares department
                buying an o god no, and look away
                fast, one of those freak accidents, the way drunken
                cowboys pass out in the middle
                of a west Texas prairie night, the sun
                spotting their bondoed pickups neatly
                on the rails until the once-a-week express
                slices their dreams in half. But this is trying
                to be art, this poem, imitate her life
                better than it's been imitating Modern
                Romances -- twitching a blonde coed across
                the path of her lying hound of a husband.
                So now, just a little too late to start
                over, she'll step out of her house of new
                kids onto her new K-Mart
                doormat, and her own sidewalk's
                banana peel will skid her
                into the street to kiss the Mack
                truck that's been coming down through the language
                for years. I bet they find one of her pink jogging shoes
                almost a mile away.
                Harry, Hilary, John, I get
                the names all wrong, say them for
                good morning, see their smiles
                sag and disappear.  Later I know
                I've called them wrong, as if
                I didn't know or care. And how
                can I go back and make it up, make it
                good?  Tell them what is wrong and always
                was, how often I hear fuses shorting
                and snapping, see only a question
                mark of smoke puff from a gray box
                on the house's white side, how it hangs
                and blows away in morning wind
                into green, the spring trees
                lime-green and thick?  How I dream, names
                changed, Philip my wife losing her fine
                dark hair, Mary my mother, bearded, or
                Don with her breasts, my dead father who comes
                tired to me each night, the one I
                embrace saying lover, friend?
                I've seen too many, interviews
                where they remember exactly forever
                what they were doing when it
                happened.  I had just opened a)
                the door b) a beer c) my Bible
                to Deuteronomy when I heard the
                explosion/growl/roar like a freight train,
                thud like thunder shaking the house.
                Where were we when Kennedy was shot?
                Where was Sheila Grahame but in the kitchen,
                Scott standing by the mantelpiece, taking
                out a carton of milk, lighting
                a cigarette.  So I keep trying this way to live
                as if each moment were the last: now I'm
                putting on my shorts.  I had just put on
                my shorts.  The way you run a tape forward
                to the good parts, what came just before and
                who cares what just after.  There's a part of
                Jamaica so rough all the men wear their black
                sharkskins striped with the slick ebony of razor
                welts.  They call it we no send, you
                no come from the days they rode back
                to back, two
                to a horse, the front one always saying how
                he heard the thump, then the shot itself just
                as he'd turned the bend.  "But all I saw was where
                I was going.  And the poor
                bastard never even knew where he was, only where
                he'd been."  And maybe this is the way we keep
                leaving each day, each moment, as if we'd never
                been, except for the one where we must
                stay, like getting off at a station or bend that will
                be that second forever, for us and for the other
                left to remember just what they were doing
                when they turned and we were gone.
                For a long time I kept dreaming
                my wife died suddenly.  She'd step
                on a board that would crack and down
                she'd go, getting smaller, my heart
                with her, mouth still trying to say
                even the first syllable of her name.
                I would never know it was coming: we'd
                be in England walking a castle wall, she'd
                step out on some scaffolding to rescue
                a kitten before I could stop her.  Or onto
                a slick green stone in the river above
                falls.  And then she really almost did, one
                second fishing by me in the sun, then
                the emergency room, the doctor saying
                something's certainly going on in there.
                Inside you laugh like a bad step on a gravel
                roof.  Then a step to right yourself
                that doesn't hold.  But you were gone from
                the first, that slight sway from dead
                center to where gravity is waiting: Walesa
                on the high wire in the wind, dropping his
                pole then himself like an ice cream cone, the space
                shuttle, another bottle rocket.  Or you try to split
                the difference between two semi's slamming like
                doors: the silence while you ride limp as a rag
                the crest of a wave, watching the spot where
                you'll hit, heart beating fastest just before
                it stops.  Movies make it almost leisurely:
                the bullet smacks, you reel, wobble, spin,
                stagger, fall in someone's arms.  They hold
                your head while you name
                names: trap door, banana peel, frog tongue.
                What is it after all but a
                judgement, a pronouncement?  Someone has to say
                "He's dead," and someone always does, but
                if they are still here, that is, the body, then
                they are still here. Eyes closed, perhaps
                heart stopped, of course. But what if no one
                said it, made that decision?  We would
                notice a lapse of words, a slight
                slumping of the body, a pause
                in the air of the room.  We would
                go on talking until, tired, we
                went home, calling their house out of habit
                for years. If we badly needed to know what
                only they knew, like the name of an
                obscure actor, or a book, we
                could go to them and ask. Until it got too
                ugly. Eventually, every thought of them would trip
                on the certainty: that where they were
                there was still silence.  We would stop
                going, stop calling.
                This is death then. Not them, not their
                decaying, as we all do, or their
                thinking deep in the eyes as if quiet
                for some reason, but only
                us, our giving up.
                When the doctor told me
                I went to the bathroom
                sat down and wept on the tall
                toilet for the sick and dying.
                Wept.  Crying's for babies, mashed
                thumbs, not for the world like
                a bruised grape or a fisted
                eye.  The tile room filled slowly up
                with grief, a roar in
                my ears, submarine.  But as low
                as I was, you were still below
                me, sedated, sleeping, or talking
                with eyes closed, beyond
                pain, sinking, wrapped
                in white, your hair a coral fan
                on the pillow.  All I wanted
                to tell you, serious, desperate from that
                height was my love and guilt, something you,
                growing deeper, darker, already
                didn't need, the vein into
                that pale, floating arm a tether
                to your new current
                leaving me to drown for years.
                You came uninvited, a stark
                and slimy, inconvenient thing
                we couldn't throw out,
                two romantics as we are.
                So we raise you in this sty,
                this poverty without hope
                of prospects or college
                only words and food from cans.
                You'll hate my guts,
                I knew that from the beginning.
                Maybe you'll even be the one
                to finally punch me out, split my lip
                when I pitch a fit, screaming
                at your mother.  You'll yell
                you selfish pig, and I'll turn
                and play my ace, saying
                coldly, levelly
                I never wanted you.
                But for now I walk you
                back and forth at 2 a.m.

                Angry at this intrusion on my
                liquor, late movies, and poems
                I shake you a little too hard.
                But you don't cow
                you just wrinkle in your red face
                and blow a scream
                back at me, already letting
                into my mouth
                the bitterness of blood.
                My world isn't hers, skin
                like mocha she climbs
                into each morning, air pouring
                through her throat clear
                as creekwater, no line where
                brown legs slide into
                silk shorts.  She's my student
                but I'm in class now, aerobics,
                flunking in a room of convex
                mirrors and dumbbells, though
                she's patient, pities me, the
                sounds I make for air.  It's
                hopeless as a dancing bear, Disney
                hippo in a tutu, a friend's
                father.  She wants to pop
                candy in my mouth when I do
                something right.  Cigarettes
                smell like burning celery, liquor
                is shellac, her heart has a slow
                beat and sticks to it, she can bench press
                me.  I sort of pity HER, daughter
                I never had, how far she has
                to go, how dirty and heavy.
                But she's perfect now, and even
                her hard music gets under my
                fat, sets my frog leg jumping
                in jean stores.
                She's working hard to get me young
                I'm aging her fast
                and three times a week
                we keep meeting here.
                My old fishing buddy calls to ask
                if I still want that skull, that a guy's
                in town selling them at a plastic
                surgeons' convention.  Forty to two
                hundred dollars each, depending on
                how many teeth are left unbroken.
                He buys in India but will have to stop
                in August, a new law.  I tell him
                no, that that was when I thought death
                was cute, like Sarah Bernhardt, with her Hamlet
                prop and sleeping every night in
                a coffin, before all those hours in  
                the hospital doing crosswords, afraid to read
                a novel in case I ran across words like
                "love, " or "alone," or "wife." Before she
                opened her eyes and said it looks like you're finally
                going to be free.  Or before I quit
                smoking and started jogging because the man
                in the next room, gross and wheezing, was swelling
                every day, slowly exploding like something already
                dead in the sun. Before I found out I was happy and
                always have been.  Pretty soon, my friend says,
                all skulls will be plastic, and we talk
                about fishing again in the Gulf, how
                we're going to stand waist deep in that jade
                water, how we're going to bust those trout, really
                put ants on them, how we're going to let them go.
                All those commercials pushing zest, out
                lusting each other for life.  Soon they'll come
                on holding a can and have a fit, as if last
                second a million beings hadn't died.
                There. Another legion, souls fizzing
                from cancers like tire air, an extra
                thousand little brown balloons gone
                from the lands where the dirt is cracked
                like lips.  Next second or the next a billion
                bugs will conclude, applauded from
                this life, round off incarnations, they
                hope, fireflies shush into dark like matches
                in water, small animals furred and shelled just
                pop on the highways, champagne
                corks on the edge of a new
                year that's always happening, interstates
                of hearts stopping, seizing black engines
                out of oil.  Slugged bodies falling down
                the sky, bulldozed, floating up, blood
                vessels puffing and splitting, but you'd never
                know by watching television, which is why
                they talk about life being such a wonderful
                thing, and it is, at least mine is.
                After I hit thirty, I found
                I began looking forward to it, even
                the cartoon lion saying floss
                only the teeth you want to keep.
                He tells me they use it to string
                agate beads it's so strong.  The needle
                is somewhere in my head, the cobra
                cyclops peering at me over his
                shoulder, war of the worlds.
                The pain hides like a pin
                in a haystack in the next
                county, but will come back later
                with drums.  I give off dust like
                a quarry and his fingers smell
                like Dachau.  Outside, air comes
                into my mouth half cold, half
                hot, and my ringing right ear
                hears me from across the room
                thanking him around the oyster
                of my tongue, lisping that while pain
                is good this is better.
                A long time we've known
                each other. I worried how
                thin you were, how chalky
                soft your bones, so ugly, sharp
                nose, tiny mouth like a carp's, weak
                chin. We grew apart because
                you couldn't keep up.
                But you did keep calling, sometimes
                drunk, long distance, your whining
                bad lungs whistling, another sore
                that wouldn't heal, a new growth
                ballooning, your heart heavy as a black
                anvil in a crate of ribs, twinges
                like blue thorns on cold vines
                lacing through your arms, in
                your ears the noise of crickets
                in dry grass.  I listened to your fear
                just the way I did when I cared.
                But now your calls wake me like stabs
                in the dark. I turn on the lamp to tell you
                before hanging up, turning back
                off the light, if you're going to go,
                go.
                I've been there.  In another room a woman
                laughs, but the lime-green
                fields are rice, the black clouds
                monsoons coming across the Bay
                of Bengal whipping orange
                saris along the plain of beach, a
                temple ruined in jade, vines
                strung with red monkeys, stones
                of steps going down into
                the brown Ganges, white cattle
                in the streets, golden curry, woman's
                violet lips, that forehead spot, third eye.

                A boy, stinging their flanks
                with a bamboo pole drives water
                buffalo at dusk, a man walking
                with a smiling girl traces
                something with his hands -- a passion, a
                memory:gray moss above a black
                river, snakes with the marks
                of diamonds, red dust, cotton.
                In my other life, I stayed
                up all night, in charge of the moon
                in the clearing, where the sticks
                got up and
                joined hands and
                danced.
                I had a crown of clover and baby's breath
                and sweet minions
                and I presided sitting on a soft
                mushroom, drinking moonshine
                from an acorn cup till dawn
                when I was put to snore between the roots
                of a great tree.
                This went on for three hundred years
                and I died.

                I woke up human, and Baptist, in Atlanta, Georgia --
                which shows you what can happen
                when you don't pay attention.
                The Indians say, it's a good day
                to die: grass smelling like
                watermelon, wind blowing yellow
                flour.  I sign a pink
                tissue that will swear if I drop
                dead it's no one's fault but my
                own, unsaid the mountains of butts
                and bottles, the doctor pitying
                me like a sinner -- he's brown
                and spare as a monkey or
                astronaut.  Young girl-jocks in
                ballet tights paste their soft
                leeches to my chest, and the treadmill
                narrow as a beam starts flowing, waits
                for no man.  Out flows the plastic
                paper of my every second, peaks,
                and valleys when the body pauses,
                debates like a fist whether ever
                to open again, pull in like a swimmer
                before the breast's stroke.  Soon
                the leather river has beaten me, I'm
                winded.  "Are you through," she says.
                They wrap the tape around my ruby
                vial of blood and I leave knowing
                the results as I walk toward
                home, looking, like a man
                for his keys, for anything
                else, one more
                image: maybe that old
                car, its cushion sticking
                from the bottom slit of the door,
                caught like a tongue.
                Hang on to these. Someday
                you may need them. Say you think
                she looked at you like a god, that
                dresses were orange, flowers yellow,
                eyes blue grass green gazebo
                white brass band red. Or when
                exactly was it?  Then, you say, no,
                Sunday she says, so you find our
                packet you have carefully saved,
                Your Memories Enclosed. See?
                It's the rolling-in clouds that
                are yellow, your face green.  Brass
                flowers, she is blue. Red
                lightning forks behind your
                unfocused face, it's too dark,
                some shadow gestures, which she turns
                to touch like a god, you were old
                and alone like you are now but don't
                remember it that way, so you look
                deep into the amber negatives for your
                self.  The squares are empty as Sunday morning.
                Thank you for your order.
                I was hungry, we all were hungry
                the world was defined by hunger.
                There was wire
                round in our skulls
                and coiled in stomachs.
                They gave us something for the body
                our minds were worse.

                In England
                as I walked my fingers
                brushed the bindings
                which never seem to end.

                Though sirens divide the night
                my bed is empty
                my body invisible
                smiles at the black sentry.

                What I learn
                I let go
                with the wind
                and the wind goes over the wire.
                It starts with little things --
                a blue web belt from the Navy,
                a book of the greatest chess games,
                a boy scout knife with ten blades.
                You suspect that this time
                they have not been lost, or mislaid, or left somewhere,
                but subtracted,
                that something has begun
                erasing,
                like cyphers, like tracks,
                the curios of your history
                starting back at the first
                and gaining on you every day.
                When you begin to miss certain people,
                you know the house itself is next
                or the street of green trees.
                One morning when you wake it will be
                color
                and you will wander for days in snow
                before, suddenly, even the whiteness goes.
                But by then it will be
                just one more thing.

Milkweed is pertinent now, so in the air
That everyone is thinking in its terms.
The housewife doesn't dare hang out the wash
Without considering milkweed; engineers
Decide today to redesign the air
Filters they thought perfected. It's a fact:
Milkweed has come to live and be lived with.

Reprieved, the birds have ceased to pluck their breasts
To line their nests -- though few enough are still
Fixing for eggs when milkweed begins to hatch
Exploding from the brown sun-brittled pods.
Occasional nestlings get mistaken meals,
Beakfuls of milkweed someone took for bugs:
Like anything in the air, it seems all things

Eventually: a faery's shuttlecock
As soon as seeds blown from the plainest plant.
Step in a cataract of light on a day
Like this, look up and see another race
Cast from its place and looking for its place;
Riding the wind toward distant, solid ground,
They scatter golden light on their scattered way.

In the park behind the meetinghouse
the Cambridge Quakers glow on the round walk;
summer suits and dresses in discrete procession,
family after separate family passes
among trellissed leaves
up the stone steps faithful still to the memory
of the night's dew,
dazzled and eased again at every stair.

The pointillist Quakers
flicker between the branches,
file past the sunken court where Longfellow,
head and shoulders, presides
over slabs and benches patterned by the light's
unhurried pointing
of branches turned through the summer day.

The sun is stirring this bowl of stones;
it simmers the day until the flecks of yellow
seem fixed on the stairs, set
before the feet of the unbuttoned Quakers
leaving the meetinghouse;
the saffron frocks flare and cotton jackets
flash over shoulders impatient
with the settled patterns of the walk
and branches turning slowly
certain on a Sunday afternoon.

All my intelligence of beasts:
Inklings of men.

How the childhood dog can turn
Sudden as a fuse
(Never my dog, but she
Sainted all eighteen years),
The camel's back break.

How the cheetah who is not
The strongest cat in town
Dragging home antelope
Glares mad into brush from side to side.

I know the housecat's lust for looking-glass,
Dolphins' for speech through a sounding sea.

Most clear of all it is
That to the great wet eye of a horse, standing
Across the fence like one to gossip with,
That sky is not called blue nor even sky:

I and another sort of animal
Have circled slowly with a closed
Impassive room as referee,
Sat and stared through eyes at eyes
Like lovers
An equal distance from the door.

On the window-sill across the alley
there are always shoes, old shoes
with tall thick heels. The old woman
rotates them like crops; every pair
is black, scuffed gray.
                                  At night
her television blares across to us.
Its gray light affronts the moon.

One afternoon while the light turned gold
my wife was bringing in from the fire escape
our rose bush in its redwood tub.
The woman's face glimmered above the shoes
and called out, 'Where are you taking
my garden?'
                    Tonight
she is a shape like a heap of stone fruit
in that flickering light, waiting
for God to come on and tell her
the sacrifice is approved, the shoes
will ascend tomorrow in a golden shaft.

But this evening, when the foxfire
ages the shoes and freezes the old woman,
I put my book down and lean toward the window
and pray that God will leave the shoes,
unpolished, filled heel to toe with good loam
and thick with violets drinking the moonlight.

One waits in the cold and thinks,
Waiting must end;
The bus must come, or love, the equinox.
And love or bus or equinox may come
In fact:
Not through machina of desire.
To bear the wait
Suddenly grown unbearable, one shifts
In irritation, acquiescence, finds
A new stance of waiting
Or of not waiting,
Standing merely under the sky.

The bus one seeks in the east may come
Bounding out of the south,
Fracturing southern sky.
The sky was molten yesterday that now
Solidifies and darkens, lumped and gouged.
Trees stick up into the holes and shiver.
They look as lost as amputated threads
Between two layers of velvet, one of which
Was sold this morning. Someone prepares a dress
For early spring. It matches the close felt
Gray on young antlers. It is nearly done.
Then she will lean to meet the trees' caress
When the days fit the nights like a new pelt.
Everything rhymes with spring.
All comes, all fits,
Not with the cling of winter mist;
The gold the eye has
Tried to deduce from limbering skies
Thrusts from the other heaver as
The crocuses' appropriate surprise.

Summer, and the strings of guitars
go flat in their cases.
The living gut relaxes in its case,
and we eat little.
Surrounded by the buzz of flies and fans
our thoughts thicken. We sit,
eyes sore with rubbing away the sun,
staring out the window at passersby,
and wonder, should we try to sleep
the flat afternoon away? Nothing solidifies.

Once there was power in summer
unlocking in our limbs
to swim, to make waves,
to reach floats moored far out
to scale tall trees
a current in the fingers
to bring the guitars up to pitch
and set flies to rout with the buzz
of brisk Spanish dances.

Delicate fire ran in our limbs.
It was verve
beyond our winters, it lay between us,
sucking us together.
It drew us into figures
beyond ourselves.

Now there is nothing more antique
than the sullen weight of limbs.
Pedestrians amble below our eyes,
we do not follow. The boxes
stay in their cases.
Nothing dances.

He steps to the porch and squints out
as if these were his father's lands
again. Crows freckle the far elms.

He is alone, gun his only prop.
Dog's dead, flung bloated into the field,
now dry as the dry field's furrows: leather thing.

Crows wait in bleachers of elm.
This would be harvest time, on other lands.
The gun too has outlived its purpose.

Sky has clapped shut over this space.
It waits for a word which will not be spoken,
holds its own breath back from elms,

back from dog's crusted fur, from ground's
dead dust, holds it for a gesture
nobody's going to make.

Crows wait too. They do not cry out.
Man does not raise his gun.
Dog doesn't smile.

Seabury's Sermons, 1793,
1798, 1815,
in crumbling leather stand in gold and burn
slowly in sunlight. Around the Anglican
the British church refused to consecrate
first Bishop in America, the dust
dancing attendance on the living light
attests the revolutions of the earth.

If all this dust is only dust
then nothing means a thing except the thing
itself -- unless the eye of God . . . unless . . .

If reading is the ground
where inference and implication meet
then sculptor, farmer and geologist
meeting upon that ground may read the rocks,
enrich the rocks, may found the stone firmly
to bear its weight in height and breadth and depth
in the mansion of the human universe,
and dust may be the finest earth.

In the Inn my great-aunt's great-great-uncle built,
here in the kitchen where the women baked
the daily staff and on the distaff spun
the thread the children measured and the men
cut and wove and stitched into human shape,
in the hearth where ashes stirred
stirs dust.

And now you've changed midwest for Middle East
And Campus Gothic for the Wailing Wall.
They gave you a gun, and bullets for the beast,
Trained you, installed you where the blow will fall.

Between patrols you write, along with dreams
Of sprinklers, 'I see things now in right relief:
The good stands out. You know what nothing means
Until you choose the beauty of belief.'

You've found the truth, guarding a zone of dunes
None but a mule would fight a camel for,
Only a man a man. The wind draws runes
With sand, and rubs them out again with more.

And still I stand my terms before the board,
Erasing mistakes and thinking toward the East
Where you prepare the battles of the Lord
And write me letters full of private peace.

around my ears the sounds rise in slow eddies
high in the center pulse the ridged whistles of crickets
the swish of a few cars lifts midnight blue to the window
now and then your pages rustle to my right
so I think of a goatherd sitting on warm stone
rhythmically brushing his goatskin musette on the stone
the goats are amused but browse and leave his gazing
cicadas above sway chewing the air in the high branches
beside his stone a stream whispers of oceans
so far away there is time for a long sleep down the hills
past stones and goatherds and on through cities
past windows where the whispers rise like blue mists
to mingle with the brushing of page on page till the lady
sleeps and the white sea takes the stream

When you get so old
the face of Lachesis
mingles in your short sight
with the mask of Atropos,
and you don't give much of a damn anyway
who it is snickering in the shadows
grown so attached to you;

when the faces of friends
stream tirelessly through your vision:
some, as through a distorted glass,
the children of themselves --
like early and late editions of yesterday's paper
gone to wrap some rotting thing;

then it's time, and barely,
to remember being sixteen,
a child standing in a field struck blind
temporarily
by the sight of someone you thought was something else,
some piece of you, an emissary.
Her feet were rooted firmly on the hill,
it was nothing like that;
but holding something
that did not shiver like the frantic leaves,
and thoughtlessly commanding the unfocussed sun
to become the shadow of her own
shining, she made herself the sign of an old pact,
a ritual future, your very lens --
Fate, in fact.
Now, half a century later,
caught on your way out
in a mirror in the front hall, recognizing
your own deformity, you think
you should shiver her image with a cry;
strain swearing and red-faced to shatter
with your own voice that dim, lying glass
that says, red-faced, that you believed it.

Go ahead, shout it down; waver away,
upstairs again to mutter in your stuffy room,
too bright and smelling of Vicks and cough syrup:
swear she was a murderess of children.
If you could only see

what happens is not
what is meant to happen,
none of this
was of necessity, nor was she
responsible, only
irresponsible;

turn around. Look again.
Only a man can shape his own shadow.
Over the years
you forgot it all,
as a man who's lost his way
will pretend sometimes
he meant all along to be just
where he is.

Your friends passed on,
died off, leaving
sons who didn't listen
when your voice meandered back to what had been
like a reflected river.

And now, after all, old and seeing again
as at sixteen
only what your mind sees,
you pass over again that early loss of sight
as a thing which is not
to be lost in an old man's eyes.

She beyond all others in deepest dreams comes
back. You shun sleep, lying in darkness, breath held,
hearing that voice over the rustling dry grass
     breathing in darkness.

Walk for miles each day, with a dog to watch, pen
paper, ink, try, focus attention somewhere
else. But Mi, Sol, Re go the notes her voice slips
     into your blind heart.

Once you knew each inch of her body. No more.
Only one thing, caught in your faithful ear, still
lives. Your eyes lie. Even in dreams the face fades.
     Only a singing.

She's your cane these days. When you tap, she tells how
far you've strayed. Tap trees by the road, you hear how
hollow things are. Listen, You'll hear in high limbs
     voices of dry leaves.

Lover to poet lends his art
Of drifting past and past a place,
Learning its flowered face by heart,
Inventing a beloved face.

He lives by glimpses. All his hope
He earns by tedium, walking by
A wall awake with heliotrope,
And learns to love its stone reply.

Should either into either fade
And either win their one delight,
Division gone, both lose their trade,
Caught up in vision, squander sight.

Eyes too adoring to digress
Engross the single sun for hours
Unless the poet's fickleness
Save lovers from the fate of flowers.

He fell and was drowned too far
from where the confrere dinosaurs
basked in their tar-pits
to decompose in peace. He froze
before he could drown, and merely slept
snug in a new block of the pole's building.

And while he slept he became extinct.
He began to wonder, in his glacial way,
being kept so long in nature's antechamber,
whether he was ignored or just forgotten
and by whom. Who was left?
He forgot.

When the little fellows he remembered
as busybodies with stone-chip spears
attacked the ancient ice and laid him bare,
he found himself so exhausted with waiting
as to have forgotten the protocol.

He could not play the old game, stamping about
trumpeting while they pelted him with brickbats;
for who would not, having lived so long
protected from the passions of the sun,
functionless, ill at ease, wish
merely to rise and step again
into the fumbling hands of the sea?

This night growing up
was born an old man.
It grows austere: the gaudy
stuff of desire is left behind,
a peacock adolescence passed.
The muscles of remorse begin
to atrophy as the moon relaxes down.

On the wall the Turner is dead
as a cat's closed eye. The sheets
have lost their fishy glimmer;
they negate our wrapped bodies.
Only the maniac workshop of the clock
still counts.

No world calls beyond the window
in summer voice of car horns
challenging. The grass is black.
Wind whistles in the air conditioner.

Memory, murdered,
comes back to haunt.
The pillow is like a ballistics box.
The air too seems to trace and claim
attempts of light, till only the clock's
green, stiff fingers irradiate the night,
working toward three-owe-one.

The river of her
will not fail into sand
(beside streams in the park
I linger with her).
Let her be so long and the sun
so play in dark eyes.

Heron, eye-bright, taut
to miss nothing and pluck
a jewelled sustenance up
for radiance of
wing: I am three-fourths of a fool,
one part beyond praise.

Her clothing is of
kinds that a dreamed river
would wear, rugged and soft,
absorbing of the
light in its matte darkness except
gleams, glints like quick smiles.

This lady: let her
be prime feather to guide
flight, and I swear fealty.
At sunset I have
limbered my wings, thrown her her glints,
thought hard upon flight.

Out there there is the
austere knowledge of birds --
the land chequered with brown
rivers, men, small earth.
Over this, wide sky, and between
no clouds to blur sight

that searches as to
embrace, kiss what it can't,
the sun's self above
the river that has
its way under the sky, over
dark earth, its bright eye.

At sunset I am
a blue glint in her eye;
the last fish of the day
is glimmering in
depths and commands (sweetly) me down
to my ignorance.

In the heat they wander from room to room
Absently picking up alabaster
Eggs from wooden cups and fingering them
Thoughtfully, without thought. The party is

Ready to break up, only there may be
Rain. They seek idly for shade, or more than
Shade, something else since, though swollen with heat,
Bulging to fart out the idle guests as
They fidget from room to room, the rooms are

Dim with blinds, blinded. Clouds are coming up
And the rain comes down. Much of the dampness
And all of the heat, wilting the eager
Corsages of the ladies, remain. The

Party is ready to break up, but how
Is one to leave in this downpour? Where could
One go anyway, since it is clearly
Too hot for sleep or food, if anything

Is clear. The rain taps as a man's fingers
May drum on a table between crises.
The guests move less and less, having found the
Last equilibrium equidistant
Each from the calories of the others.

Through the window's just-ajarness, threading
Neatly each head by its two ears like a
Pearl, a siren's frenzied grief whirls closer,
Pierces, whirls on down the scale toward silence.

A great argyle sock
tree-hung
for Christmas (stuffed
stiff with blackjacks,
silencers, the long
black toys of death)
in the dappled leaflight
writhes. Maybe
it is wind, moving
the leaves.
                 Master
clown, Pan
troglodytes below
gambols
snuffing a little wind,
watching with half
a happy eye. You
know the story:

Death winds & the wind dies.

He might come out of a cartoon.
Draped in much overcoat
He follows his wife from Christmastime
Aisle to aisle, contending
Against a sea of faces,
Adding to his arms at every counter
Another parcel or two,
None of which alone, it may be,
Weighs a great deal or is very large,
But which have summed a structure constantly more
Precarious, what
With socks for Grandpa, sisters'
Scarves and dresses, aunts' and
Uncles' books and for the
Kids toys of a dozen bizarre
Unmanageable shapes and stuck
In a crevice two new ties
For him. His wife is short and gray
And nicely dressed, her taste
Is good. Her energy's immense.

By accident as I pass I catch
His eye and that moment,
Surely by accident,
The grand disheveled lovingly gathered
Pile shifts by a fraction and all
At once begins to fracture into constituent
Gifts, a Christmas
Cornucopia --

From his gray
Eyes to mine, just as the first
Package speaks its independence flares
A dream: Deep in a forest
In sun of a summer evening, no one
But birds and trees and possums
For audience and maybe God,
A jongleur keeps a dozen toys aloft,
Hoops and hoop-sticks, dolls,
Tops and a shining sword, shattering
The light with brilliance of their tumbling.

When people pass at a double door
they turn (they must turn)
inward toward each other's face,
and meet with foolishness if, linked
like fingers by the two doors' clasp,
they refuse to smile. (For feeling foolish
each resents the other's eyes.)

More: if a wind on one side eases In
and presses in the Out, In's pressing in
helps Out, eases the pressure. This is not
conundrum but choregraphy,
the rhythm of social acts,
the chain gang's grace.

In a meadow far from double doors
a girl dreams among flowers.
The watchers say Who?
Who did she leave the dance with?
Early too, they say.

From mezzanines I've watched long lines
turning in pairs this way, making a chain
of allemande-lefts like a chain of flowers
a girl has woven while she stands,
the circle slipping from her fingers,
broken to a single braid.

Even the weariest, laden with bags
or shrewdness, tricked
into stranger-smiles,
caught up, have gathered from the dance
a grace,
             as flowers
bask in a girl's rapt hands.

The bear's my neighbor
next cave down --
keeps to himself;
allows me the squirrels,
I leave him the trout.
He keeps folks at their distance
for us both.
He's a quiet soul.
Oh, in spring he
roars some at night --
I find his marks
eight foot up the pines.
Come summer,
he settles in,
says nothing more than he's got to say.

Once in a space
we come across each other --
stand still
on our own sides of the juniper,
looking,
nod, go on
about our business.

In autumn, stream
starts freezing up, he
sees his time --
rest of that year
I miss him.
The bear
knows what he knows.

I wanted to laugh when I saw her smiling at him;
pale moon mouth in the same old crescent,
cradling him -- eyes that were
gone already, a green god's-fire
taken on that twisted torch --
lips that opened like a wound to say
she did.
Did he? You bet.

I wanted to laugh when she was
shackled by a finger to that
jackal, who hadn't even stolen her,
surely not from a mad young dog
chuckling masterless in a back pew.

But when her father,
'in the perfect image
of a priest,' pronounced them
one person, I
had to laugh.

               we
called her
Loud but that was

The sky
was huge, as he had said
it would be. It sat

cleanly on his mountains,
and filled the wild fields
with color.

Because he had said it would be
beautiful, it was.
Or because it was beautiful,

he said it would be.
I was aware of him
behind me, in the house,

and in the fields in front;
and above me in the sky, filling
all things with their own colors.

I wrote in a small book
that he was larger in every way
than myself.

The blue ink
forced me back
to the sky: I froze

when his shadow fell across the page.
He stood beside me on the porch,
looked out on his world

and saw that it was good, and smiled.
That day long I saw looking out,
a guest in his world,

and tried to be easy there;
but the sky only drained me away to a
thin, blue shell.

Another summer: bookcase-building time.
I've made the yellow sawdust rise all day,
Six days it's filled the air and slowed the light
Lapping the coteries of other years.
I've paid a week for space to shelve a year
Of new acquaintances, volumes of friends.

My friends outside this room are like this room's
Forests of books I fell and range to hand:
Here's James, in whom I find unfolded B;
A is a simple soul, I learn from Proust.

Thinking my leisure here would help me learn
More than your winter nights of talk in bars,
Gestures among the leaves on autumn walks,
My friends, I've tried to make you characters
Flat as the leaves of books, like leaves between
The stiff, preserving pages of my books.

I'd rather check my heart to learn the time
Than read my passions' passing from the clock.
It seems that all this dust has closed my eyes.
My friends, I'm taking off the day to clean.

the sludge in water-pipes
the pipes themselves

everything's black inside

cows (till they're drawn & quartered)
are big sacks of darkness
& warm

needles

it was black once, warm & moist
you liked it too well to remember
now that your limbs are clean

once they drew & quartered souls
to extract the blackness
like a fistful of sludge
& cast it away

but the pipes themselves . . .

& it only worked
because they couldn't close them up again

they knew they were right
when they saw the oily smoke
rising into the face of heaven
right about them all, every mother's son
not one mistake

& inside the knife's blade
it was very dark

Noon sets the tips of pines on fire;
trunks' shapes are half-guessed. The goshawk's
claws glint among ragged feathers.
My feet trace out the hurried way.

When the field and its winding path
answer no question, pose nothing,
my stride slows; easy light casts down
the tree behind me till, a shade,
I wind through the branching shadow.
Evening's levelling everything.

When I see the hawk's smooth winging
home, it seems the world lays down arms
forever. (Hunched in the thick grass,
a blind spot swimming in this blind
repose, a mole thrusts through its long
labor, through this short peace of night.)

Light wears thin. I hear doves whistling
in the dark. On the wide field, day
lies down to sleep, a man worn dark,
his own shadow's weary hunter.

There was a time (such songs begin this way)
When every jewel that graced a pocket, each
Pebble and shell, keepsake of thought's delay
Over some bit of world, had a private speech,
The stored-up, light, long story of a day.

But now there greet the fingers, when they reach
Their refuge, in place of something that might relate
The feel of summer, searchings of a beach--
Car, house, and office on a chain, a weight
Of paper, a half-handful of silver speech.

My mother's mother painted her
Perhaps in 1936
At perhaps thirteen
In the tentative light of a White Mountain dream.
The house not shown
Is sold to strangers now.
It might be raked leaves the color of her hair
She watches, flushed.

Her high and silken blouse is the same
Blue-green as the mountains,
A color almost of sea.
In 1936 her eyes,
Half as old as when I met them, half
As old as I am now,
Were dry as leaves,
Bright as the scattered leaves.

My grandmother nearly always painted trees.
In this there are only mountains, things
Keeping their blue distance.

The old lady is dead. Her brush
Made these mountains of a half-known mother's wish
Or set them down as they were by her daughter's eyes
Composed of vague desire and the sea.

She dreams of distance
Hazy and wide as the North Atlantic,
Peopled with strangers;
Holds it still as she holds her blazing
Head for her mother's brush.
Between pale lips she
Breathes the world that invests her
Into being,
Formless,
Perfect:
A woman with my own face,
Thinking of other things.

When the hair is carefully trimmed away
You find in the pig's forefoot a little hole
Through which the legion of devils bow in and out.

Say they enter on a summer morning,
Leaving the marks of their tiny claws as six
Small rings. Then, 'please the pigs,'

As the Saxons say, those trotters flash
In as fiddle a jig as you who listen
Candidly will hear from any warm

Sly singer in the mud: 'Oh the mud is good,
There's plenty of good to be found in slops,
And the best of the good is a beast in shade.

They'll slit my ear and cast me out
Unfit for human consumption. Bub,
I'll follow anyone home who feeds me, yes,

And live to a hundred and five or ten.' Oh trim
The hair from a pig's forefoot; I'll show you why
A poke is best from the inside. And a sty.

The pillows were white and fluffy, 
an effect reminiscent of sitting in sidewalk cafes 
on lower Fifth Avenue, back in the old days, 
or of sipping Mexican Pernod with Irv and Harriet, 
in their cabin high in the Sangre de Cristos. 
The night outside would be cool and black with promise 
of snow and the outhouse a good twenty steps from the back door. 
But, in the old days, lower Fifth Avenue was peaceful, 
even in wartime. The President had an apartment 
in a building on Washington Square, but was never there 
nowadays, according to the doorman, whom I never failed to ask. 
All over the world, people were going to sleep and waking up, 
fluffing their white pillows and going back to sleep again. 

Irv and Harriet's cabin was actually in the Sacramentos, 
the Sangre de Cristos being much farther north in New Mexico. 
But there's something about Sangre de Gisto, the words, 
in Spanish. There's also arena, which means sand. It can also mean 
"arena", which is fair enough when the arena has sand in it. 
But the names of things can fool you at times. 
The Sangre de Gistos aren't in the least bit bloody 
to the naked eye, and presidents' apartments don't always 
have presidents in them. The Red Swan turns out to be 
a woman in disguise. And north of the Sacramentos 
and south of the Sangre de Cristos are the Sandias, 
which are partly sand, but mostly rock.
I have nothing to send you. 
My bowels reek. It has been 
raining here forever. 
The news has been bad for weeks. 
Even the neighbors have only petty 
scandals to whisper about. 
Birds of bright plumage 
are reduced to rags, 
dogs die and rot 
in the gutters. 
What did I do, 
where are you? 

This is in the valley of the Rio Grande. 
You are standing in the hot sun 
at the intersection of two roads -- one 
paved, a yellow line down the middle, 
the other dirt, angling off through the cottonfields. 

There is no one in sight. No birds in the sky. 
You see the tracks made by cars and trucks turning 
off of the dirt road and onto the paved one. You also see 
those made by cars turning onto the dirt road, 
but you cannot distinguish these from those made getting on. 

And then there is a cloud of dust speeding up the valley 
toward you. A cloud of dust moving with no wind. 
And out of the dust cloud emerge six yellow buses 
full of schoolchildren -- Mexican, Indian, Anglo, 
and mixtures of these. Schoolchildren, laughing 

on their way to school. And then there is a seventh, 
in which the children are no longer laughing. It stops 
for you, and you enter.
a strange rain falling 
with its strange burden
and always running 
legs heavy, chest heaving, 
headful of memories, premonitions -- 
                                                         the tall rain 
thrusting down through the dark, death-dealing 

death riding the rays of the sun
thought of small rain, wind from the west, 
sidewalks of cities in those days, shining, 
slippery with light, those lost days 

the big hand clasping my small one, 
how warm it was there!
sunlight didn't matter: the heart 
had its own darkness, as the sky 
beyond blue is black 

                     "Listen, my children, and you 

the backyards were empty, everyone 
moving away from the old block 

                     shall hear of the . . ."
eyes are everywhere, like bits of broken glass, 
watching the high tower for someone about to appear 

& the watchers are being watched
and the blind virgin 
unravels herself 
from the folds 
of a flag 

her body shining 
in the falling rain
String quartets on Sunday afternoon. 
Pittsfield, Massachusetts, nearby. Melville's Pittsfield! 
From which in a car I followed a girl and her mother 
all the way to New Haven, Connecticut. 
After the concert, in a Howard Johnson's, they were eating 
at a nearby table. The girl -- nice legs, 
nice breasts, nice face -- she smiled at me, 
her mother looked away. And I followed them 
-- didn't know if they knew it was me -- all the way 
to New Haven, their very front door. 
How they sped through those small Connecticut towns 
-- got a ticket in one -- surprised 
as hell to see me in their rear-view mirror again 
-- the demon lover at their -- her -- heels. 
The girl saw me pull up across the street, 
smiled, said something to one of her two burly brothers, 
who took one step and I was off for ever. 

Under his chair, his hat 
like a small, tired animal. 
His hands resting on his knees. 
A map of his life on his face. 
Black angels whispering in his ears. 


A somber day. Hardly a bit of sun. 
A woman with bare breasts. At intervals 
there are cats, dancing in the high grass. 
Clouds high overhead, not a solid gray. 
Houses press in on all sides, none 
of the doors or windows open. A widow, 
solitary, sits behind her house, with bare 
breasts, an invisible face, and no sun on it. 

The notes of a song, picked out singly 
on a piano. The hands mistaking. The eyes 
moving among the objects presented to them. 
Picking and choosing. Testing the qualities 
of a certain kind of vision: single, flat, 
unpenetrating. Things are so simple, 
it seems to say. You never know, she says, 
you hardly ever know. Once I was happy. 

The day disintegrates into crashing chords 
and discords, wild intervals of passionate 
meditation. A touching of hands, and the faces 
turn to each other. Lightning leaps 
among the towering clouds. A gusty wind 
springs up, wipes away a world. 
 

Pushing aside 
the thick branches, 
branches thick with 
tender & green leaves, 
pushing aside the green 
tender leaves, moving 
into sunshine, looking 
for, yellow sunshine 
from blue sky, 
sniffing a wet breeze, 
pushing aside the thick 
leaves, moving into 
sunshine, looking for 
berries? 
 

Moving west along the canyon floor 
scruffy mesquite & cottonwoods at river-edge, 
likkered up like all the rest I saw 
her high broad cheekbones ("her friends 
call her La India, but not to her face") 
dug her incongruous, powder-blue eyes 
her "never-to-be-forgotten" smile. 

River running faster now, down toward where
we came from, the desolate east. Who was it 
said she would kill me? I forget now. 
Bunch of stiffs in the next car maybe. 
I said I'd gladly die. Those coppery thighs! 
My moccasined, musky Rose of the West! 

Higher up, the canyon walls pressing in 
ominously, barely room for the tracks and a trickle 
of water. Occasional points of light shining through 
the blue darkness of the closing mountains. Before 
it was complete, we had already come 
to an understanding. 
 

They stood across 
the broad meadow from us, 
their armor gleaming 
in the sun, their horses 
pawing the ground 
and snorting. 
At the sound of the trumpet 
we charged them. Yells 
and shouts filled the air. 
They began to move toward us. 
The field was filled 
with a flurry of flags, 
a clatter of weapons and armor, 
a pounding of hooves and hearts. 
As we reached their lines, 
they broke, fell back 
and melted 
into the trees. 
And before we knew it, 
a gang of them 
were throwing rocks at us 
from the second floor 
of Mr. Simpson's garage. 
Luckily, most of us 
had garbagecan tops 
to use as shields. 
But they 
were throwing rocks! 
And trying 
to hit us, too! 
Stevie Jackson got hit 
in the head 
and began to bleed 
and cry. We started 
to run away, 
but another bunch 
of them were hiding 
in the Simpsons' garden. 
Stevie got hit 
by a stick 
and fell down crying. 
Jake Gibson, Fred 
Martin, the lieutenant, and I 
lobbed several grenades 
into the densest part 
of the foliage 
where the bastards 
were hiding. The radio 
operator called in air support 
before he got a bullet 
in the gut. He screamed 
for twenty minutes and then 
died. The strike 
was quick and clean, 
leaving nothing 
but charred jungle 
in front of us. 
Steve Jackson had a hole 
between his eyes. 
I threw him over my 
shoulder and carried 
him to the chopper. 
We had been friends 
all our lives. 
The chopper lifted, 
and those of us 
who were left 
fanned out 
into the rain. 
By the time I got home, 
I was late for supper, 
and Mother punished 
me for getting wet. 
Stevie Jackson spent 
three weeks in the 
hospital that time. 
 

carried herself well. Her mount, 
while skirting the purple hill, 
broke a leg, and, to its 
everlasting credit 
insisted on 
finishing 
the race 
on three. 


What do you do 
out in the West 
where the proud remnants 
of European aristocracy 
climb down from their phaetons 
in haughty disarray 
and walk, bare-headed, into the desert 
never to be heard from again 
unless it is in some dusty town 
called Drygulch or Sidewinder, 
bypassed by the railroad, 
wells long ago gone dry, 
where they take their parched throats, 
their sun-cracked faces, 
into the only saloon left in town 
and ask the one-eyed barkeep 
for champagne, and are told that 
there's one bottle left 
which he's kept for just 
such an occasion? 


It was late Saturday afternoon. 
By the time she got home 
from the motel, she was 
already desperate.

Epilogue



He lived
his life 
as though it were 
a work of art, surrounded 
though he was by piano students turned bankers. 
His cup of tea
was paradox and conundrum. His lively mind 
thriving on contradiction, infesting it 
with its own inextricable logic. 
Accosting voluptuous young ladies, 
requesting them to divest themselves 
in the face of Historical Necessity 
and the deplorable Social Graces. 
All of this had a numbing effect, giving way to 
an unlikely series of series, the legendary
plumbing, the plumbing was numbing, the shovels
were digging, ideas taking root, another 
round of interminable conundrumming 
coming to an end. 
Then -- ah, then -- to give it all up
to upchuck it all up, all up, chuck 
it all up, up all, chuck it up.

His early period laid a firm
foundation for his middle years (sometimes 
known as the Diddle Years) in which he did
liddle or nudding. Noodling around in his
Attic studio, cracking valises, playing chest, 
smoking reflections or pipestems, punishing 
his friends. And his friends
(if you can call them so, for I, I never shall)
his friends came always slinking by to see 
if there was anything new to be catalogued. 
And would look him from toe to head in contempt, 
call him an aging terrible infant 
and slinking slink away.

The end of the so-called Second World War
found him somewhere in Central Europe, wandering 
in a daze in his self-styled garden, thinking
of his good friend Anton, whom he hadn't seen 
since that summer in Munich before the war,
and devoutly wishing that some drunken American 
soldier would come by and put a bullet in his cabeza.

A landscape full of twigs, dirty leaves, and autumnal
splendor. A glowing amber lamp held aloft by the left 
hand of a three-dimensional nude, golden curls lapsing 
onto her shoulder. Her lovely legs are spread 
provocatively before a shimmering waterfall 
and a small pond.

He died 
as he would 
have wanted to.

 

walks down 
one side of the 
street instead 
of the other for 
some clear reason

those who are 
dead or have more 
money than he

What we were never aware of was 
that Mary & Jane had run off to Barbados 
where they are living together 
as husband and wife 
we hope they will always be happy 
we were also unaware 
that a first cousin of Mary's 
on her mother's side of the family 
has been confined to an asylum 
for most of her natural life 
& that Jane's father's uncle 
was a self-made millionaire 
who died in poverty on the third day 
of the seventh month of his eightieth year 
he did not rise again insofar as is known 
we are sure that Jane's family 
wouldn't have stood for it 
Mary's family also pretended to gentility 
after the elopement an aunt of hers was heard 
to ask why she had to do it with a Baptist 
 

You fall in love bit by bit, 
piece by piece. First, 
her legs, sleek and nylony, 
cutting along E. 47th St. 
Then a quarter profile 
from the back of the crowd 
at the bus stop. The back of 
her neck, a wisp or two of hair, 
as she pauses at the fare-box. 

Day by day you inch up on her 
in the bus. A glimpse of 
her smile drives you crazy. You catch 
a whiff of her perfume and the next day 
you rub elbows with her. The bus 
lurches to a stop. You feel her breast on 
the back of your arm. This is Friday, 
naturally, so you have the weekend 
to think about it. 

Monday, you make your move. You brush 
her buttocks with your hand. Next, 
a day or two later, you let her know 
she is definitely being felt. A squeeze, 
a goose. The weeks are passing like days. 
She hasn't called a cop. You slowly turn 
her around, look into her eyes. She looks 
feelingly into yours. Days pass like weeks. 
She lifts one of your hands to her breast. 

Soon enough your other hand is at her crotch, 
feeling around. Her thighs are gripping it 
like a vise. Working it around. Her eyes 
have been closed for weeks now. Her breast 
heaving. She's gasping for breath. She's 
ripping your shirt with her nails. 
And when it's all over, 
she slowly opens her eyes. Her hot eyes. 
"You're wonderful, you're wonderful!" she sighs. 

You want to know her name. 
Where she lives. Who she is. 
What she's doing this weekend. 
She puts a finger to your lips. 
"You're wonderful," she breathes. 
Her finger taps your teeth. 
"You were wonderful, dear, 
but don't say a word. 
Let's not spoil it." 
 

They are waiting 
their toes are 
curling in their 
shoes they don't 
make any sound 
but I know they 
are waiting there 
their eyes are 
narrow slits and 
their hands are not 
in their pockets 
they are waiting 
behind doors or 
in alleys I can 
hear their breathing 
if I hold my 
breath 


Her departure 
had been the occasion 
of general consternation. 

Several committees were formed 
to seek ways and means of bringing 
her back. These were called Ways & Means 
Committee #1, Ways & Means Committee #2, Ways 
& Means Committee #3, and so on. 

These committees would meet early in the morning, 
before the sun rose so high that their members would 
be unable to think very clearly, what with the heat and all. 

Most committees found it advisable to divide themselves into 
sub-committees: as, Ways & Means Committee #42, Sub-Committee 
A, Sub-Committee B, and so on. The sub-committees would usually 
meet in the evening on a more informal basis, 
often in a neighborhood bar & grill. 

Mornings, the sub-committees would report back 
to their respective committees, which would then consider 
the merits of their recommendations, separate the wheat 
from the chaff, as it were, and send the wheat 
along to the Central Committee, 
made up of committee chairmen 
and chaired by the King. 

The Central Committee met once a week (but only on Tuesday 
afternoons, so as not to interfere with the King's golf schedule). 
It would discuss the proposals of the various committees 
and invariably decide that none of them were workable. 
Each chairman would defend the suggestions 
of his own committee and attack 
all the others. 

The upshot, of course, was that the King grew more and more furious 
by the week. He was put off his game and developed an almost 
incurable slice. In a rage, he asked his caddy what he should do. 

Send someone to ask her to return, the caddy said. 
The King sent the caddy. The Queen returned. 
To universal applause. 

Moral: If a system works, don't knock it. 
 

They insist always 
that we leave off this

As we must, we take them

             Someone was always turning 
pages, making rattling sounds 
in the next room. 
                          The variations were endless, 
and these are only some of them:

The pages are always being turned. 
There is always someone in the next room turning pages. 
There is a wind 
blowing across his desk 
from an open window. 
 

Our guide and our bearers have fled. 
The snowfields are blazing. 
At this altitude, the sky is almost black. 

We have attempted the South Face and failed. 
The storm broke our descent. 

Our fingers are frozen. 

The world is white and then black 
and then white again. 

We had no chance for the top. 
 

Your unfortunate situation 
reminds me of a time I was alone 
in a strange city. It was a dark 
and obscure day, as though I had 
brought my own weather. 

Some friends of mine 
were to have met me at the station, 
but seemed to have forgotten all about me. 
So I was obliged to walk. 

My friends, evidently, had moved to another city. 
For three days I tried one address after another, 
climbing stairways, knocking at doors. 
Three nights I slept in a park. 

You are not alone you see. Like you, 
I suffer, thrill at the thought of it. 
 

Someone he knew 
was speaking to him 
from very far away, so far 
he could barely see him. 

They were sitting at an oblong table 
and he was at the other end of it. 
He could see his lips move 
but could not hear what 
he was saying. 

He had been told that he would know him, 
but now that they were face to face 
he wasn't sure he remembered. 
Blue eyes and sandy hair. 
He couldn't be over thirty-five. 

The table was round now, 
and he seemed to be screaming at him. 
He could almost remember where it had been, 
where he had met him. His blue eyes. 
Why was he screaming? 
His sandy hair. 


              "Your self-delusions exact 
              their own price 
              in their own time."

His own last words, 
from the fire. 

A fantastic life! 
A man depraved by vice, 
as they thought. Refined. 
Perverse. 

Unknown to those 
living in his own house. 
Spied upon. Whispered about. 

There was too much rain & then 
there was not enough. Floods 
followed by drought. His 
magic was strong. 

When the crops had failed 
and they were hungry, 
proverbs, folklore, 
and even astrology 
proved small consolation. 

He makes devils, they said. 
He speaks with the dead. 
He eats the unborn. 
 

Night falls heavily through the trees, 
the wet ground holds it. 
In the morning, there will be fresh tracks 
in the wet ground. And no one will know 
who left them there. 
The night is dismal 
and we are afraid of it. 
Morning dawns grayly, and there are 
things that have happened that we 
know nothing about. 

A man's life is like -- well, what? 
The moisture found on early morning grass 
has fallen silently during the night 
and vanishes before noon. 
There is the sudden thrashing of an animal 
in the high grasses and reeds 
at the edge of a scum-covered lake. 

The smile of a woman so beautiful 
that she is confined to a garden 
with walls so high that no one 
can see her, with walls so high 
that no one can see her smile. 

A beautiful afternoon. The trellises were disarranged. 
The palace eunuchs were trepanning the Emperor 
in his very own garden. The power struggle 
appalled all of us who knew of it. We few. 

Nothing from nothing. From nothing comes nothing. 
Nothing comes to nothing. Nothing added to nothing gives you nothing. 
If you have nothing and nothing is taken away, you are left with 
nothing, nothing less than you had to begin with. Nothing from 
nothing. Nothing more, nothing less. 
 

My power is very great against you. My dreams 
have been auspicious for weeks now. My arm 
throbs with strength. My heart pounds strongly 
in pursuit of you. Your name is weak, is weak. 

All signs are favorable to your death. Your death star 
is in the proper quarter. Your life star sinks 
into the sea. A tree bent away from you as you passed. 
Your wife and children were seen moving away from you at the same time. 

Consider my need for your houses, your goods. 
My land cries out to be added to yours. The eyes of your wife 
seek mine. I said your name to the wind, and the wind took it away 
and hurled it down upon the rocks. And the waters covered it. 
 

Walking where water 
never flows and I 
had heard that you 
and I were never yet 
wherever she was singing 
or would sing a stone 
that's under water when 
her flower went awry 
a song her sister knows 
or sometimes said she knew 
 

Beneath the bough -- 
O, melancholy devil 
O, sonofabitch 
I'd like to rip your clothes off 
See you walk naked among the rose petals 
 

The mountains around Cayey are green. 
The walls of my office are green. 
Dark green at the bottom. Light green toward the top. 
My office is on the second floor of a white building. 
The building is one of several white buildings 
arranged in a semi-circle, at the center of which 
are two flag poles, flying the flags of Puerto Rico 
and the United States. 
My office has only one window. 
Until two years ago the buildings and grounds were 
a U.S. Army base known as Henry Barracks. 
Old Army men still think of this place as Henry Barracks. 
The parade ground is now used for track and field events, 
although an R.O.T.C. unit marches there from time to time. 
From the window of my green office 
I can look across the green campus 
and see the green mountains. 
There was a sign upstairs, over the urinals. 
"Don't throw butts in the urinals," it said, 
"and we won't piss in your buttcans." 
This sign was taken down. 
From my window I can watch the students 
walking across the green campus. 
The students can look up and see me watching them. 
They cannot see me when I am sitting at my desk 
or standing well away from the window. 
The mural depicting the Last Supper 
in what was once the mess hall 
and is now the snack bar 
was also taken down. 
My office has only one door. 
It is directly opposite the window. 
Just above the door, the word EXIT is painted 
in red letters three inches high. 
Just outside the back door of the snack bar 
is a small sign that says MESS HALL. 
Some things here have not been changed. 
 

I am sitting on my porch reading. 
Across the street is the city welfare office, 
a woman in red is sweeping the sidewalk. 
Down the street to my right is the municipal hospital. 
People come and go. A Catholic high school 
at the end of the street. The girls in their white 
blouses and blue jumpers pass beneath me. 
To my left, a group of men playing dominoes, 
with loud exclamations in Spanish. 
Somewhere, off in the distance, the Russians 
are madly marching on Finland. 
 

Last night, 
the summer 
wasn't very 
warm, I slept 
with mother, 
my hand 
on her fat 
breast. 

Sometimes 
I wake 
up and feel 
things 
crawling 
on me. 

I always 
think 
of that 
soldier 
leading 
a chicken 
on a string. 
 

I am walking through a field 
of yellow flowers. Under a tree 
in the middle of the field of yellow 
flowers sits an Arab in a white burnoose. 
From the middle of the field of yellow flowers 
my Arab stares at me, advancing toward him 
through a field of yellow flowers. 
 

We were picking our way among bits 
and pieces of debris. I stopped to listen. 
Behind a large rock, a bird was singing. 
By the time it was finished, you had moved out of sight. 
 

Time and again, I watched her 
go up to the door 
                           & return, 
without having entered. 
                                   The spring breeze 
stirring in the garden, ruffling 
the curtains of her bed. 

The curling smoke of our cigarettes 
flattening out near the ceiling. 
Our ambiguous conversations, 
returning always to the same themes 
: mockeries, self-parodies. 

               The fading sunlight, 
               the other side of the door. 
 

Sanderson's glance fell on me. 
One of his eyes was bigger than the other. 

Do you know my name? he said. 
His nose was like a big, red strawberry. 

Sanderson, I said. 
His face was leaning, trying to smile. 

You're right, young man. 
Sanderson is me. 


Reminding me of the beginnings of things -- 

long journeys, early breakfast with the lights 
on in the kitchen, pulling out of the driveway 
just before daybreak, a thermos of hot coffee 
in the glove compartment, my father yawning 
as we drove away 

the first day of my life, the first day 
of the world, moving out of the shadow, the whirl 
of forms, slow spinning of planets and galaxies 

the first damn girl I was old enough to think 
I was in love with, a smile as bright as the sun, 
but before that a shoulder as cold as the depths of space, 
gradual warming after chill 

our man and machinery poised at their border, the sun coming up 
behind us, we could see them beneath us, moving around 
in the shadow, we hit them as the sun hit their eyes 
 

How desperately 
the coffee-colored river 
surged through the streets, 
the town you had abandoned. 
 

Hazy horizons. The sky 
that never stops turning. 
She is lost. 
Wandering in circles 
in the cane-brakes 
by the river, 
where no one will find her. 
She doesn't notice 
the birds turning 
in the air above her 
& the sky above 
their turning, turning. 
 

The flat, blue light is below us. 
Your hands move shamelessly 
on my back & thighs. 
Trees emerge from a velvet background. 
Move this way & that. Something is 
moving between them, among them. 
You are lovely, but what 
are you saying? The words 
make no sense to me. 

The light is leaving. The bay & the mountains 
behind it will soon be engulfed by darkness. 
It is warm, the water now, lapping at our feet. 
But what cities, what fires, do you mean? 

delicadas,
         green, tracing 
into, under, through 
beyond green 

                       fire, 
green consuming mountains 
corrosive, consuming 

it was green, she 
                   said 
        turning a pale hand 
 

Oh, the richness of it: 
the dark horse scampering 
through the sea-breaks, 
gulls crying overhead, 
the way she turned her head 
toward us, smiling her dark smile. 
A wave of her hand and she was off 
again, down the beach, turning 
and galloping back, smiling, 
smiling. And the animal beneath her, 
glistening and snorting, 
snorting and glistening. 
 

Trees opening, 
flowers with no eyes, 
a long dawning, morning words 
turn Barbara's way, hear 
mountains wish, 
                        blonde stranger 
conversation piece 
                            of the sun world 
 

Up the coast you know 
San Pedro and the rest 
of those small towns. 
Not much rain, but you 
could hear violins on hot 
summer evenings, surf 
curling toward the beach. 
And if you'd ever thought 
to leave your hotel room, 
walk the cooling sand, you'd 
have seen a kneeling girl 
picking out bits of red coral 
the last tide left among 
the seaweed and palm fronds 
at the water line. Hearing 
your step, she'd look up. 
Seeing you, the last light 
on your face, she would have 
smiled, though she did not know you. 
And, in the darkness closing in, her smile 
might have saved you. 
 

We are surrounded 
by the sea, the sea 
is all around us. 
We are ourselves 
in the circles of the sea, 
ourselves to the end 
of the curving sun and sea. 
Today is a windy day, 
we are so happy. 
We are ourselves in 
the circles, ourselves 
to the ends of the sea. 
No wind today, 
and we are happy. 
We are ourselves in 
the sand, the circling sun, 
the curling sea, the curving 
ends of what we barely see. 
 

from the shade, 
the shade of the brim 
             of his hat 
they move, 
a yellow car turning into a narrow street 
from the shade of a tree among trees 

turning into, 
what should we call it, 
this avenue of fading yellow trees 

it was not as though nothing had happened 
: there were his eyes, following us 
moving like leaves, through the chromatic forest 

***

& his women, moving in twos through the town, 
along the thin sidewalks, on their heavy legs 

& his daughters, with lighter hearts & heads, 
sitting, mornings, within his walled gardens 
as though nothing had happened 

***

& their green mountains, ringing the town, 
dreaming of yellow cars cruising the highways 
as they have for centuries 


Begin with an apology, 
some reason for not having written 
for seven months 
                          one month in a hospital, 
six in the mountains, convalescing 

       continue with something 
relatively unimportant, 
like the weather -- 

                         the dry air, 
     with brief showers in the afternoon, 
     the patterns of clouds on the hillside 

          the way the sun shines 
          through the broad, green banana leaves 

     tell her how those tiny lizards breathe, 
     those tiny balloons in their throats
Oh, God! The pain of it. 
Why haven't I seen you 
in all these weeks? 

What was it? 

I didn't mean to force myself on you, 
I thought you . . . I wanted . . . I . . .
Not that. 
No. 
I've never seen so brilliant a green 
as in those banana leaves with the sun behind them, 
the veins in them standing out 
like . . . 
                                         What was it? 
I thought everything was going well with us, 
that we wanted the same things for ourselves.

No, a letter like that it's better to write 
and throw away. 
                          Tell her about ugly things, 
those people we read about in the paper, 
the foaling mare, clubbing it to death, 
tying a rope to the foal, 
dragging it out, killing it
A strange mood. 
Nobody around now. 

I'm sitting on the veranda, wishing I had 
some cigarettes. Occasionally, I can bribe 
one of the chambermaids into buying some 
when she's in town. 

She smuggles them in past the doctors, the guards, 
sweet girl -- she returns my letters unopened 

The least she could do would be read them, 
don't you think?
Tell me something about yourself. 
What do you hope for? 
Do they beat you very often there? Is your condition 
incurable? Are they treating you well?

Things are very difficult here. 
The man in the next cell is out of his mind. 
He keeps writing imaginary letters 
to imaginary people, usually ex-wives 
or girlfriends. 
Because I'm a writer, he always asks me 
to help, check his spelling, etc. 
I think of you always, 
you and the children. 
They're beating the horses again. 
Down in the cellar. In the dark. 
I love you and miss you. 
Why don't you ever write? 
The sun is warm. 
It's been months now. 
Why don't you write? 


Among her belongings 
were found three pieces of coral, 
probably collected on her trip to Tahiti. 
A spider was living in one of the pieces of coral. 

She knew she was dying 
when they wheeled her into the terminal ward 

& she refused to admit visitors.
She knew she was dying the day she was born. 
Not an obsession, it was, with her, an acknowledged fact. 

But she seemed to be obsessed by nets. Nets & webs. Her talk 
and her writing were full of them. In her apartment, 
the cobwebs were never disturbed. 

The last time I visited her, she entrusted her diary 
to my keeping and told me where I could find it. 

This is one of the last entries, dated 8 August, 1965:
They are traps. I have always loved them, 
but they are traps. Since that day on the beach, 
the water placid behind the reef, I have known 
I would not be one of the ones who escaped 
or were thrown back. I would be hauled to the beach 
to do my flip-flop of death on the dry sand. 
Pray God that mine will be one of those that command 
the eye with their vigor and beauty.
She died in her sleep and was found in the morning. 
Someone said she was beautiful 
 

How much escapes us, in respect 
of ourselves moving with 
and away from each other. 
Carrying souvenirs, each 
to the other. Bits of dead skin 
beneath our nails. Loose hair 
on our shoulders. The tune of a song 
we've forgotten the words to. The words 
we can't remember how to sing. 
 

Under a black tree 
at the edge of the cliff 
something was turning 
the day to its good end 

and his worries 
left off where the water began, 
the edge of that world 
we most fear falling into. 

Among other things he heard her voice 
calling to him, singing for him 
behind him, among the dark trees -- 
the water shining before him. 
 

then someday someone 
will knock on 
your door, having 
walked for centuries 
to get where you are 

having been offered 
a chair, he will take 
off his coat 
and sit down, smiling 
though tired 

you will offer him a drink & he will refuse, politely 
there will be an uncomfortable silence, as though 
not knowing where to begin 

                                           at last, you will speak 
                                           you will clear your throat 
                                           & ask him where he has come from 
                                           but what you really want to know 
                                           is what he has come for 

                         & you've begun to suspect 
                         when he turns to you and says 
                         `Let's speak of that in the morning' 

and in the morning, of course, you rise to find 
that he has already left 

                                           and it is almost evening 
                                           before you begin 

                         to notice the difference 
 

This is what I believe: 

Below the visible surface of the world 
is an immense, brilliantly lighted room. 
Throughout the room are millions 
and millions of pictures, each 
a representation of the world upstairs. 

Mine would be a landscape with yellow birds, 
surrounded by fantastic vegetation. It would be night, 
and the birds would not be flying. There would be 
a moon. A full moon transfiguring the green 
and yellow jungle. 

Many complain that five of my six yellow birds 
are upside-down, and that the strange plant-life 
seems to be rooted in the sky. 

The truth, my friend, is that you, the viewer, 
are upside-down, and only one 
of my six yellow birds. 
 

Standing here at this upper window 
I see two men shouting at each other 
in the distance. The sun behind me 
flashes on a knife before me, and I see 
one fall, collapse and die, and hear 
what must have been a scream. 
 

Forever bringing us sorrow, 
coming across the smooth lake to us 
in a gray haze. 
                      Coming across the smooth 
water to us, across the waving grass. 

The voices of women reaching us 
through the smoke of their fires, 
the vapors rising from the surface of the lake. 

They are singing our death songs. They call us 
by our names. And the men there are sharpening knives 
and putting on armor. 

When they are ready to fight, and the singing has ended, 
disaster for us begins. 
 

Wondering if I would ever see you again 
I walked to the edge of town and sat down 
in the darkness wondering if I would ever 
hear the sound of your voice telling me 
that you loved me so much that you would 
do almost anything in the world for me 
except walk through that town in darkness 
and by yourself for the several moments 
it would take me to reach you to reach 
out to you in the darkness from where I was 
sitting all by myself at the edge of town 
wondering if I could ever touch you again. 

Outdistancing the others 
we came to a small, deserted island -- 

                   a curving beach of white sand, 
                   a fringe of palm trees heaving in the wind
We were depressed by the heavy smell of death in the air. 
I spent half of the night looking for you. You, traipsing 
around, the hem of your dress 
trailing in the water.
And from the air, 
drifting in on the trade winds, 
we see below us the giants 
hunched over beneath the clear, blue-green water. 

They are waiting, biding their time. 
Only the tops of their heads break the surface. 
 

I want those first words desperately trailing 
off through the underbrush, spattering light 
on the wall of my cave, mumbling along 
like her tiny feet in the carpeted hallway. 
I want our transitions as smooth as cream, 
elegant as our hands upon satin, clear 
as cold water running over polished stones, 
as a hand and a hand on a silken knee. 
Our lives should be no longer than our arms 
bearing arms through the soft, fleshy night, 
stretching, reaching out softly from our sides 
in cadenced light to a tentative ending. 
And the last two, like the first, in tandem, 
hand in hand, and screaming to the end. 
 

Wanting things to go on forever, 
yet craving the apocalypse. 
Reading the last few pages at one word a minute. 
Wanting to teeter forever at the brink of the abyss, 
and loving every minute of it. 

The solid single lashed over second. 
A shortstop's arm, just long enough to catch it. 
 

What we need 
is to examine this from as many 
viewpoints as possible 

There, for example, is an old woman pulling on her hose. 
She has rolled down the tops of them, pointed her toes into them, 
and begun to pull them up over her calves, her knees, her thighs. 
She smoothes them to her bulging flesh and then with a few tugs 
hitches them to her corset by means of the straps depending therefrom. 
She turns her back on a floor-length mirror, and twisting around as far 
as she can examines and adjusts the straightness of her seams. 

And then, in broad daylight, she turns and walks away. 
 

It's my fault. 
There are circles within circles within circles. 
They are like ripples on the surface 
of a perfectly round pond 
when a perfectly round pebble 
is dropped straight down into it 
precisely at its center. 

They just keep spreading, getting wider and wider, 
and even at the water's edge the impulse continues, 
diminishing with each successive ripple, 
but making themselves felt nonetheless 
as they go on spreading wider and wider, 
more and more minutely, world without end. 

I know it's my fault. But all those others 
only stand around in a circle, wringing their hands 
and crying. Tears springing to their round eyes, 
almost as though they were not enjoying themselves 
at my humiliation. They cry for all of us, they say, 
they cry for us all. They range in a circle around me. 
Their tongues are tiny dots in the circles of their mouths. 


Several times a day I go outside & peek at the sun. 
It is always the same: Between 8 & 4, just a bunch 
of colored disks -- red, yellow, green, blue -- popping out 
at you POP POP POP POP. Just like that. 

After four o'clock in the afternoon it always gets bigger 
& bigger and redder & redder, until, like the swollen 
nose of a wino, it slips below the bar. 

Sometimes at night I go outside and look at the moon, 
catching sunlight on the rebound as it were. But when 
the moon is full, on the far side of earth, I think 
of myself on the moon, watching the sun in the dark of the earth. 
 

Sea-swimming the mastertank 
the brainwaves spilling over us like something 
I would rather not talk about 
                                            her face 
though there was nothing particularly wrong or right 
with it did it seem unusual that she did not return 
with us that no one ever seemed to hear from her 
again. 
         It was the same old story It was his wife 
who wouldn't listen to him his protestations He 
spoke to her of love 
                               & every bit of her attention 
    went right out the window, whistling Dixie 

I should have thought that that would be enough to warn 
you. But, tell me, now that you know: 
Do you have any sincere regrets? 
 

Specialties of light. 
Among the mountains, voices to be heard. 
The clean air, to be seen, looked into. 

The campers in Dog Canyon were not surprised. 
Perpendicular walls shut out the sun. 
And yet -- the air was light, 
light & air, moving. 
                 The mountains themselves 
seemed to move with it, breathing. 

Moving air, carrying with it the smoke of campfires. 
In early morning, the smells of bacon and coffee, 
swirling through the trees. 
The trees themselves: aspen, pine, and spruce. 

Three hours of sun between the walls, an afternoon 
of drowsy breathing. Sweet smell of horses. 

After dark, distant sounds have an edge of fear. 
And the chill in the air smells like ice. 
Ice moving down the mountains again. 
Down from the top of the earth. 

Late, after midnight, between midnight & dawn, 
our eyes turn out into space. The frozen stars, 
suspended in nothingness. The one time of day 
we can see where we're going.

After Reading Tolstoi
They've poisoned my dogs.
It's come to that at last.
They stole away the horse
and then poisoned my dogs. Three dogs
I slept and ate and hunted with.
Under the moon, their silence howls around me.

It was Sten, the youngest and strongest,
who tore my heart. Took a full day in dying.
Lay there long, only his pain before his eyes.
The others were older -- one was his father --
not as strong. Gave in more willingly.

If I were young, this would have been different.
As a young man, I was a raider. Carried off
what I wanted, and none dared to stop me.
No man could kill my dogs and live.
And then this town, this miserable stone and rocky town,
begged me to live here, be its protector.

Poor job for a fighting man. The town attracts only scum.
But, just over prime, I worked hard for them,
kept their hands clear of blood and killing.
In their church they placed a handsome statue of me,
called me their seventh Knight of Heaven. God pity the others!
They built a house for me, built it strong of stone.
It keeps out wind and rain. They gave me Margareth
for a wife. Not rich, but beautiful and young,
and weak -- as passive as a drowned seagull
nudged along by each passing wave.
A young and beautiful wife.

Some sickness carried her off, and most of the town --
left me half-crippled, fighting off looters and raiders.
Finally then, nothing left worth fighting for. So I'd ride
and hunt with my dogs. Came more and more
to sitting still, listening to the passing rains.

The statue still stands in the church, though nobody
knows we were the same now. The dogs are gone,
and the horse. I've seen a young girl kneeling
before my statue, dreaming or praying. Are these the same?
Praying to, or for me? What difference could it make?
I sit in the house now. No dogs in the yard to give warning.

From miles away,
I see long columns of them, moving southward
through the snow. Turning aside
from my original purpose, I find
now that I no longer fear you.
I have collapsed my tent
and begun to move south, along
with the rest of them.
You are dead now,
and I no longer am full of fear.

It is warmer. The river is free of ice.
They remember us here, and have thrown up defenses.
Within the walls there is laughter and singing.
We are too hungry and tired to fight them.
Come spring, I will find you again. I will change your life.

The woods are dark and thick.
The trees are nailed to a black sky.
A mile back it was snowing in sunlight.
We're sleeping tonight beneath the Bishop's window.

In a house at the edge of the trees
they huddle on long winter nights, making things of leather.
Before bed, the farmer, on a stiff leg, walks to the door
and looks out. A patchy fog is forming in the lowlands,
drifting up across the meadows toward the trees.
He doesn't see us, but knows we are here -- down from the hills
and crazy with hunger. His traps lie half-hidden before us.

The nights there
were never unguarded.
The vaulting walls
leapt into shadows,
and in the shadows
there was dancing.

The light of the rose
in a blue glare. We
were dancing, were
dancing, were dancing.

Arising from her bed
she moved through uneven patterns
of sunlight on her floor.
She will continue to glide
through splashes of vivid color
until the voices and instruments
in the courtyard below
have grown silent.
Primary colors: greens, reds, and blues --
alternating, pulsating in wavering banners
on the walls, the ceiling of her room.
On her naked flesh.
A footstep on the gravel.
A whisper from the nearby trees.
She turns aside, stifling a sob.
A handful of flowers,
tossed through her window, falling
at her feet.
Mending a tear in her skirt
she listens for his arrival,
but she doesn't look up, not
even as he enters the room.
He looks at her and smiles.
She smiles without looking up.
It grows dark.
The first sounds of music come up
from below. There are flashes
of sheet lightning in the distance.
Silence. The smoke of a sweet-smelling wood
drifting through the open windows.
He touches her hand.
The smoothness of her hand.
Her studied composure.
Even now.
Please do not leave me.
Please do not go.
What would I do?
What would I do without you?
Without you there is nothing to do.
No one to turn to, to wait for.
I am a Pale smoke drifting through the trees.
The musicians have departed.
Only a slight breeze now,
pushing gently at the curtains.
A distant rush of water.
Go now.
There is no fire here.
Only smoke.
A view of the sea. Trees stirring
at the top of a cliff. Watching the sunset,
the wheeling, plunging pelicans,
we would talk about suicide, about throwing
ourselves down upon the rocks,
into the churning tide.

For minutes, or perhaps only seconds,
our blood would stain the rocks and sea.
The birds would descend like clumsy angels,
and when they arose we would rise with them,
our wings beating strongly, our voices good
only for screeching, eyes peeled for fish.

in darkness,
running over wet
pavement, soft
earth
washed onto
the road by
rain --
          easy
to make
a wrong turn
on these
winding roads
in the mountains,
to get
lost
on so little
an island

The lights flicker and grow dim.
Then with a crackle and tiny puff
of smoke they go out. And for the first
time in years we are left in darkness.
In town, headlights of cars sweep the streets,
corners of houses, but they will also
blink out soon. Clinica Font on the plaza
has its own power, but even there
they cannot hold out for long.
Nights settles more deeply over towns and cities
in the mountains. We still have candles
and the means of making fire. But now
we will not see so clearly after dark.
Our attackers will remain. Faceless,
dreaming shadows.

The house gives us shelter.
Its walls and roof protect us from the rain.
And from the sun. At these latitudes, we have no fear
of snow, and thus our roofs are flat.
Because our house rises above those of our neighbors,
we can look down on their roofs when it rains
and see that they are like square lakes,
holding the water until it has time to drain away,
or rise in steam into the sky from which it fell.
Many of our neighbors are adding second storeys
to their houses, so the days of square lakes
are numbered.

The houses are made of concrete blocks. Lumber
is expensive, coming from far-away places
like Nicaragua and Brazil. And then
all wood save the hardest (mahogany and such) is subject
to termites. Our house is old. We have cheap, wooden doors,
as thin as tissue. The debris of termites appears each morning
in tidy little piles beneath the doors. They leave their
trails on our walls and ceilings. This house is
their shelter too. It also provides them food.

O separations!
Internal organs are bleeding
The stuffing's coming out and passing among us
collecting oysters for the poor
This was never enough to sustain us  It stank
of garbage and was unrecognizable in any other
form hair in her eyes and her horn honking
The wind was whispering in her ears and her ears
so delightful to nip at, were pinkish
The wind was cold
O accidentals!
Delightful to stumble upon and there was an old
man who liked to look at her legs and look at
her legs and her legs

This is just me. These words,
I mean, they are only me. Nothing
to be afraid of, or to worry about.
We can travel, go where the stars go
when they're gone. Now you're in this too.
We're going somewhere, but we don't know
where. But it's nothing to be afraid of,
nothing to worry about. Now watch me.
Watch me carefully. I'm going to
disappear before your very eyes.
Don't be afraid. I'm gone now.
You're alone again. All by
yourself. What does it
feel like? Are you
afraid now?
Are you?

For a few days, I was traveling
in a strange country. The people there
were very poor -- fighting over scraps
of meat I would throw to them. Their language
was untranslatable into any other.

The sun sets early, leaving a red smear across the sky,
you look up in surprise --
                                       the olive trees stand like old women,
bent & shaken on the hillside --
you carry a load of branches & sticks, as though you were a beast of burden,
you wear black, as though always in mourning,
you travel this road every day.

We were speaking of
a random arrangement of figures,
most of them slender and dark-skinned,
standing, as though at work with rakes
and shovels, among several -- no, many --
yellowish-white pyramids of salt
stretching off into the near distance.

Atop one such pyramid
would stand a middle-aged woman
(or perhaps she would look older
than her true age) who would be wearing
a baggy blue dress, and a headband
to keep her long, black hair off her face.
A hundred pounds of salt strapped to her back.

Beyond the mountains
there are more mountains.
The road I thought I'd seen the end of
has turned another corner, vanished beyond
an outcropping of rock.

In the hot sun at noon
I meet a traveler going the other way.
He too is thirsty and without water.
He too has been walking all day.

We greet each other like old friends.
We abandon the highway. The mountains embrace us.
I saw you by a lake.
I thought it was you.

I thought it was a lake.
As I came nearer

the clear, blue lake remained,
and you vanished. I thought

it was you who vanished.
The lake was not a mirage.

Blue and clear it remained,
shimmering in the sun.

There was no sign of you
in the sun by that lake.

I walked into the lake
in despair, never thinking

to find you there, sleeping,
with the blue waters drawn

about you like a blanket,
sheltering you from the sky.
I know nothing of the airplanes
or the twisted spoons. The air was clean
when I arrived here three days ago.
And now?

Well, now I sell these things from door to door.
They're light and flexible and full of fun.
There are two models. The first is soft and pointed
at the end. The other is squarish and opaque.
Don't worry. We bear full responsibility for them.
Yours only to enjoy, and make small monthly payments.

There'd be one town and the next, and I'd go home again.
The door would be open and she'd be gone, as before.
Piles of unread newspapers, squeezed-out tubes of glue,
open jars of ointment, lying all around.
Sometimes I could figure when she'd come home
by the amount of underwear she'd left behind.

Looking east in the first light of morning, I'd see her face
rising above the city, a huge balloon covering half the sky.
Later, she stares at me from the west. Her bloated face destroyed.
All day long, I've moved and breathed in the staleness of her breath.
I was driving
east along the
highway to the south.
Traffic was light. A few cabs
and horse-drawn wagons. I whistled to myself.

Where three roads came together
there was a clog of traffic. People of all ranks,
milling about on foot. The sound of a siren.
Its melancholy rise and fall. Trailing off into the distance.
With my feet I scattered red and white bits of glass.

Upstairs later, in bed, we were still laughing
about the mistake she had made. Long ago.
she had taken me for someone else, and now at last
she was able to laugh about it.

I was reminded of the splendid sunsets of the south.
The modern highway curving past the beach. Sandcrabs scuttling
landward.
Land-side dark. Last trace of daylight, caught in the web of the sea.

It was a small parade. Four or five instruments
and a couple tattered banners. I watched them from the porch
of my hotel, as they straggled onto the public square.
The trumpeter wiping his lip on a dusty sleeve.

I walked out to the edge of town, knowing she would wait for me.
The stars there were exquisite. Cold and clear.
The few houses I passed were illuminated by candles,
the men and women in them just sitting down to their common meal.

She was sleeping. In the dimly-lit room she had fallen asleep waiting
for me. I touched the smooth skin of her belly. She moved
very slightly. Then her eyes opened wide and she recognized me.

Long lines of trucks moved overland from the coast.
The mountain roads were bent and twisted. The trucks
moved slowly and noisily, and I took great chances,
darting and weaving among them.

Beside the small roadside shacks there were many girls,
smiling and waving. Their teeth were bad, but otherwise
they were not unattractive. At open-air bars along the way,
the sweating drivers would gather, boast of their triumphs.
I myself would listen, and learn.

These days were windless. The skies all day, a heavy blue.
The sweet smell of carbon, hanging in the air.
The women tending their braziers, toothless and old.
Often she would come to me during the night.
She would appear at my door unannounced, wearing nothing,
or the flimsiest of shifts. And I would lift up a hand to her.
Nights of closeness, followed inevitably by
mornings of careful indifference. Her softnesses
deferring to my strength.

Great heaps of crated machinery at the docks. The beggars moving
among them, seeking out the careless, stray tourist. The statue
of the great explorer looking out to sea. The government offices
reeking of confusion and delay. The police, their rifles balanced
on their shoulders, fingers always on the triggers.

I sat on the porch, reading her mail. Interminable letters
from those who had once known her. Looking up from them
I could see thunderheads crowding up from behind the peaks.
Within an hour the storm would be upon us. Downhill avenues
would become tumultuous streams of muddy water, boiling up
at the wheels of cars and trunks of trees, moving inexorably down
to the lower parts of the city. The slums, the docks, the harbor.
Power would fail. And night would come on unopposed.

***

I raced east along the coast,
turned southward into the mountains, and began to climb.
My arm hung out the window. My fingers played with the wind.
The air became rapidly cooler, and soon I was high above the city.
As the road narrowed and steepened, I ascended more slowly.
Young boys ran beside me, trying to sell me bright
green little birds they carried in small wooden cages.

I spent the night in a small hotel in a decayed mining town
high on the face of a mountain. I ordered a modest evening meal.
From a nearby table, an old man smiled at me. I smiled and nodded
back. He cupped in his hands a small green bird. He smiled and cooed
at it. He smoothed and preened its feathers with his tongue, and with
one snap of his jaw took its head off. The head, and then its body,
went out the door. He smiled one smile, blood dribbling from his
mouth, and shuffled out into the night.

Next morning I went on, higher into the mountains. But the farther I
drove the more pointless it seemed to continue. I turned around and
headed down. For hours it seemed, I floated, drifted down toward
that hot white city, the citadel of her affections.
Bandits were hiding among the trees,
and across the river were only pig farmers
who wouldn't look up from the mud at their feet
if the sun itself fell hissing and steaming
into the river. The river could turn around
and flow backwards, uphill into the mountains,
and those thick-heads wouldn't notice.

The hooligans in the woods
could strip you and skin you alive,
they could rape your wife and skewer your children
on pointed sticks, and those clods across the river
would only be conscious of mud squishing between their toes.
Piss sloshing between their ears, the piss-heads.
Their own mothers could be carved into cutlets
and fried before their eyes, and they'd only shove
their greasy thumbs farther up in their noses.

One day it was necessary for me to cross the river,
and Black River Bridge was beyond the trees.
I bid farewell to my wailing wife and children,
and set out on the path with my life in my hands.

The sun was up. The river was flowing the right way.
And across the river the pig farmers were playing,
hitting each other with clubs and falling into the mud,
laughing and spitting out teeth. And someone was hiding
behind a tree at the comer of my eye. I tumbled down
when he tripped me, and he fell atop me, pinning me
down with his ax. He breathed in my face and showed me
his teeth. He had nice teeth, considering.

"I am Tasso, a poet," I gasped, hoping to win his heart.
He quickly sprang to his feet. "A poet!" he exclaimed.
"Well, that's different. I'd sooner steal pig-turds
from those boneheads across the river than take money from a poet."

He guaranteed me safe-conduct through the forest for life,
and once a month one of his band would leave a pig,
freshly slaughtered, at the door of my home. In return,
he asked only one thing -- to see, just once, his name
in writing. So here it is:

                      Benedetto Mangone,
                      who would not rob a Poet.
Abundantly green flowing river
water in many channels
southward flowing and warmly

green things squirming and wet
filtering sunlight slow but sure
and settling bottomward,
the others scurrying upward

out of the sludge, and feeling
their way toward the light blue
flow of morning weather.

***

Letting fall a light green veil,
the ramshackle air of a summer morning.
Her pillows are of yellow and white stripes.
Her eyes, a light green against them.
She's half awake. Her nose begins to itch.
From the tall weeds beyond the garden
a death is announced with heavy sweetness.

But breakfast on the Porch, an orange and toast,
is very reassuring. The gathering of flies
is not for me. Some leaves stay green forever.

***

Little shepherd on the windowsill, we smashed him with our fist.
We stamped his pieces into the carpet, crushed his eyes.
We catch fireflies in the garden after dark, tear their wings off,
put out their fires. The dog that died behind the barn,
we saw the hair and flesh melt off his bones each day,
the buzzing swarm of flies. We dropped his bones in the river,
watched them settle, one by one, into slimy green.
At thirteen
I was torn from my mother's arms
and sold into slavery among the Pennsylvanians.
In the years that followed -- those long, empty years --
my mother often wondered just why it was me,
why it was me who was chosen.

I'd always thought it was the fairness of my skin,
my delicate complexion. In all of New Jersey
there was no one as fair as me, I'd been told.
I always stayed out of the sun in New Jersey.
"Keep your skin white. That's all that we live for."

But here among the oil fields and coal mines
of Pennsylvania it is just the opposite.
They rip off my clothes and smear me with grease.
They powder me with coal dust. Their heavy breathing echoes
among the hills. They love me here. They just love me.
Up along the line
there was another
child there was
another way another
line of response

thought her smile
her smile was amazing
appealing

in other words
her blue eyes smiling

she came here one night
& stayed forever.
                                                     grasping one moment
                                          of clarity
I escaped --
                     over the wall
                                                     & into the woods
listening, not listening
                     to the laughter
                                          of my mother & father
            sunrise
                     allowed me
at last to see
                     myself clearly i was old
my hair had fallen out
                     i had no teeth
                                          my lips
                     were frozen to the windowpane
someone was screaming at me from the next room
             the wall there was higher than ever
      the woods near the house had been leveled
               and the children, the others
                     the children
             and the children of the children
were in church, praying for me to escape, once and for all.
Look around you.
See me
             everywhere.

The birds are my
messengers,
             my eyes
in the sky.

Touch
             a tree
& tickle me.

Lick an ice cream cone
& feel me melting

inside you.
Another summer
and again you will be flying downhill
on my handlebars, your hair
will be blowing in my face,
the taste of it will be in my mouth.

Another autumn
and rolling in leaves, my hands
will be itching to touch you.
And winter comes, and snow falls,
and we drag our sleds to the cemetery hill.
We try the hill behind your uncle's house
and stay at the bottom for hours.
And spring comes in with mud and rain,
and walking with you by the river.

Another summer
and again I will be flying downhill
on your handlebars, my hair
will be blowing in your face,
the taste of it will be in your mouth.
Late May, and still there are patches of snow here.
Long lines of sheep, crossing the highway like pilgrims.

High mountain roads are still closed in Wyoming.
The passes from one warm valley to another
are frozen tight with snow.

High in the mountains are corners of snow
the sun never reaches. Never.
It is a piece of land, both ample and secluded,
on the far side of town. To get there, you take
the first uphill street from the harbor
and follow it as far as it takes you.
There is an old church. You stay well to
the left of it. Further on, there is an old tree,
which you should keep on your right.
On moonless nights you will recognize it
by the strange glow hovering in the upper branches.
Beyond the tree is a field of ploughed ground,
steeply pitched on the highest part of the hill.
Dead Man's Field, it is called. No one in town
knows who ploughs it. Or what, if anything, is ever
harvested. My sister Eva knows. She surely does.
Not wanting to leave, exactly,
but having been told to get out of town before sundown,
he suddenly decided that it might be nice to take a trip.
His health had been poorly, and, you know, a change
of climate might do him good.
So he said goodbye and left town, taking
only the bare essentials, traveling light.
Towards morning, in loneliness and anger, he came upon
an isolated farmhouse, where lived a sad and beautiful widow,
who, in his rage, he would have raped and murdered
(or murdered and raped) had she not quickly found
her tired, broken heart could beat with love again.
When it finally occurred to me
that the road might have been
tampered with, I got down on
my hands and knees to examine
it closely. Though the night
was dark and moonless, I could
see that the surface was pitted
and scarred, that tiny fissures
sometimes extended from one edge
of the road to the other. The extent
of the damage dismayed me. Round Hill
now seemed far away, so very far away.
I thought at first
it was the wind.
The wind, I thought,
had broken up the light
along the chain of lakes.

The ground was more broken
the higher we climbed.
The light, more intermittent

Nothing moved. Nothing
touched me. I might
have been on the moon.

But you were there with me, weren't you?

***

Each lake was smaller, higher, colder than the last.
Nothing moved. Nothing touched me. What I thought was the wind
was only your voice, echoing and swaying among the huge boulders.
We have an opening,
the songs of exotic birds
awakening just before dawn, looping
and skimming in sweeping arcs,
black against graying sky.
Suddenly everything starts to make sense.
Your skin seems radiant in the lucky
light of love. The roads all begin
to lead where we are going, and confusion
is altogether a thing of the past.
The buses continue their circular journeys,
but this time we know exactly where we want
to get off. And what we can expect to find there.

We are translated into another life. Our moves
and gestures, deft and self-assured. No longer
at odds with our surroundings, we watch the trees
toss their secrets into the air like blossoms,
feel our roots taking hold in the dark earth.
Handfuls of angels
spelling out disaster with the waves.
A starlit night yielding to morning.
Sea swelling and falling and swelling.
Breathing. Rising up on its haunches,
pawing the rocks at the mouth of its cave.
Roaring into bright, full-grown daylight.
Spitting at flowers on the sea-wall.
Raging against continents. Eating mountains
for breakfast. Swallowing ships
and men, as little old ladies
follow their dinners with
just a sip of cognac.
            In obscure corners
                                         of my mind
I always found myself
believing
                      that if I could
            only conquer
                                      my fear
of the dogmatist
                         in you, there would
     be something
                                    between the two of us
that would never be
                    finished.
                                      Something
       small, something large.
Something
                      as clear
       and precise
as the snap of your fingers.
Mouth pressed to mouth, we made
                                one last attempt
to make her forget that she
         only the day before had been
   a woman sunning herself on the beach
glancing up at a stranger among the rocks
            who said she later
   might come to
                    regret very much
having entered the
water.
                        With everything moving slowly
   toward where she sat among the
          empty chairs of the old hotel, she was
              desperate about
                    not wanting to believe
the stories I had told her
   about islands so remote
                  the only sounds were those of
           bodies slipping into
the clear water,
          white flesh shining, sinking
to the bottom.
Disturbing to the ear
soft touches fell about
where mountains slid together
just below her northern mouth.

Oh, no. Now
let me ask you this.
Where were you when
they arrived, the soft women?

Oh, no. You
don't know. No,
you don't know.
No, you don't.

              I ought to --
              feeling awfully out of place
              -- I ought to know
              where I belong. Where home is.

It was a mist.
It was a mystery.
But planned by others,
their fingers probing, sliding
among the soft folds.

***

If Dad were here,
he'd show me how to do this.
Now go easy, boy. No need
to rush now.

Oh, I don't know. The feeling
is a mystery, a misery
sometimes. The feeling I don't know.
What I don't know is like a shadow.
It's like a shadow, Dad, that
darkens all I know.

***

Oh, I don't know. There's all this feeling swelling up in me.
I'd like to keep it separate. Keep one thing one place, other
thing another. But if you can read this, Dad, you ought to know
what I'm talking about. It's not like dreams that keep coming back
night after night, but it's almost like that. And it's almost
like something else, Dad. The way the things you remember best
are never the things that made any difference.
Parking tickets,
faded causes
                    & no
           frantic measures,
or anything apt to disturb you.

Chrome-plating guards your city,
where light lifts softly from the sidewalks
& streets, touches briefly at your window, & gathers
once again, so high above your head.
Things change: for the
better or for the worse,
but they change. Even
the things which do not
change cannot remain the
same.

You stop at small towns
on the highway, even at
Murdo, South Dakota. You
take a picture of it, and
then it goes away.
Smith pushes huge triangles of sky into place,
while Harrison erects trees.
Three small birds -- Jasper, Whit,
& Puddle -- whistle columns of figures.
Farmer Brown plants tunafish sandwiches,
but only when his wife is not around.
All things fit together, says the preacher,
whispering behind his hand. All things fit together.
Hunter & hunted are opposite ends of the same trajectory.
I saw you ride away on the last horse
and thought of nothing else for the rest of that week.
As usual, the house (we called it our "cabin," remember?)
seemed empty without you. Your "absence" inhabited it
like a ghost. After several days, I followed on foot
the trail you had taken, expecting at the crest of each hill
to see you trudging toward me in the distance, throwing open your arms,
ready to embrace me, glad to be home again.
But for years then we had gradually been running out
of horses. Our little drama was coming to an end.
Or was mutating, working drastic shifts in direction
which neither of us could have predicted. As now, even as you
vanish, something rushes in to fill the emptiness you leave behind.
They were wondering
what to do about her mother,
wandering through the thorny
underbrush, wading
in water up to their thighs.
On the Mexican side of the river
a burro, thoughtlessly,
watched them.
The air was chilly
for that time
of year. Her mother
must simply be told
was what they finally decided.

Downstream, at a car ford,
there was a Ford pick-up truck
stuck, about half-way across
the river. A bunch of Mexicans
were trying to pull it loose
with horses. By the time
they succeeded, it was nearly dark.
We are not children.
Now we are surrounded by dead planets
and satellites. No longer can we rush
off into the wilderness, throw up a fort,
and send out scouting parties
to harass and enrage the savages.
We've returned to simple pleasures,
sleeping late in the morning, sitting quietly
at a table, sleeping cats in our laps.
This is so ordinary.
There is no way to tell one piece of sea
from another. A man
jumped overboard & walked away.
No one on board could remember his name.

If you've seen one cloud, you've seen them all.
The birds that followed us to sea
are garbage-picking scavengers.
Someone told me that once they land on deck
they have no way of taking off again.

At night, of course, there are the stars.
If you are interested in looking at stars.
I arrived early enough, but never understood
exactly what was happening. There were the customary goldfish
swimming around in circles, bumping their noses
against the inside of the glass.
She sat down with me and tried to explain. The moths,
she said, were everywhere. Even in her bedroom
closet, eating away at her favorite blue jumper.
I did what I could to console her, but in reality
my thoughts had turned elsewhere -- to the geraniums
in the garden below, tiny insects gnawing at their stems & leaves.
A rage swept over me. Damn your blue jumper! I said.
I insulted her--nearly struck her! -- but jumped to my feet
and ran down into the garden. I glanced up,
saw her watching me from her window, tears streaming down her face.
Above me, but just within reach, a modified fish-hook bobbed near
the surface of the water. It was silver, and glistened. I leapt at the bait.
It wasn't enough, was it?
Or did you turn away
before she was finished?

Or was it the gray car
shining in the aftemoon rain
that impressed you?

She had the last word after all,
didn't she?

Or was it the clear, cold
water rushing past in a whisper
a few inches from your feet?
O, someone is sleeping (who is it? who is it?)
someone is sleeping here. My face has been feeling
the brush of her hair. Lightly, lightly.

Nightly the air is on fire. The star bleeds in vain.
The ocean grayly sweeps the empty beach in search of you.
I chant your name to the deserted sky,
but there is no answer.

The fragrance I loved still lingers in this room.
Those hands I yet feel upon my body, rending and tearing.
Joy of the sun, burning my flesh. How I desire you!
Turning my hand to no purpose,
cleansing a smile in clear water --
             words whispered at evening,
             forgotten by morning.
Our feet move forward on a path paved with seashells.
Our lungs suck deeply at the salt-water air.

We are kneeling at a sandy grave. Your hand holds
a jagged piece of metal at my throat. And when my blood flows
it flows unevenly, a river of many channels.

My going to sleep is like waking. My sinking into the earth,
like rising -- a scarlet flower lifting itself into
the stratosphere, reaching to strangle the moon.
The Earth there, lying under darkness
& swirl of clouds around
where blue should be.

             Do you think we were wrong
             about her? Could we
             have been mistaken?

She felt
her way blindly, groping along
the green walls. The gates were swinging open to her.
Before we could cry out a warning, she had entered.

We moved ahead through that green sky,
and it was full of impersonations,
the voices of loved ones and distant relatives
remembered dimly from our youth.

We often thought
of her entering that place. Her blindness
had moved us to pity. We often competed
to see who would take her hand,
lead her through the darkened streets,
and soft, furry alleys.

In order to share her world
we would blindfold ourselves,

or sit in the gloom with our eyes tightly shut,
magnifying the sounds and smells around us,
hearing her voice in the darkness
telling the old stories.

Retelling ancient stories of violence & death.
Three men and one woman together,
living in a narrow valley. She was the mother.
She spoke with the voice of a mother, and saw them
with a mother's eyes.

The narrow valley was enclosed by high, green walls,
which also embraced the sky, high above them. As daylight
faded and night sounds emerged, he would dream of her
as his wife. The soft, warm place between her breasts.
The one between her legs.

And in the shuddering cold of morning, he would die.
The skull-shattering rock, wet and warm with blood.

As a young girl, she was terrified
by the dark, narrow streets. The men of the town
leering at her from doorways.

                                             I wanted to help her,
but couldn't. They would drag her roughly into alleys,
smothering her screams. And when they were finished
I too would throw myself down upon her.

That particular street would be full
of black balloons. The gate swung open,
and you were shoved forward into their midst.
The balloons surrounded you, nudging and clinging,
pressing heavily upon every surface of your body.
With your last breath, you would appeal to
the tiny flecks of green dancing before your eyes.

The words. There came a time when I could no longer
command them. When they sailed into high, piercing wails,
or diminished to points, fainter than the faintest of stars.
Confronted by rabble -- robbers or common soldiers -- I was unable
to deal with them. I was at the mercy of waiters
and taxicab drivers. I became absolutely dependent on you.

After the meal, he would stand in the doorway of his house,
picking his teeth and watching the shadowy figures
passing by in the street.

                                   She would cling to the opposite wall.
To her, his eyes seemed like small fires. In the small, mud church,
the handful of flickering candles in their red glasses
reminded her of his eyes. On her way home, the door of his house
was shut. She hurried along, wrapping herself
deeply in her own shadow.
After the meeting, the blue badges were handed out.
Round, blue badges, with no inscription or device upon them.
The more daring immediately pinned them to their lapels
or shirt pockets. Those who were more cautious would pin them
to the underside of their lapels, or the inside pockets
of their jackets. The timid, or uncommitted, would slip them
into their pockets, discard them later in the street

The well was dry, and he soon grew thirsty.
From bottom to top was a climb of fifty feet, with two secure hand-
holds on the way. He had attempted it and fallen back many times.
He sat now at the bottom looking up. At the top of the well
the sky was like a blue disk. Perfectly round, if he stayed
at the center. Slightly elliptic, moving toward the wall.

The meetings were endless, and she attended them
only because of him. The speeches, the arguments,
went on forever. Eternal disputes over lines of action,
over subtle points of ideological difference. I waited,
watching her watching him. He would fall.
It would be only a matter of time.

The women were with us. They hid hard things in their soft places.
There were explosions. There were accidental detonations.
The sentries would handle them roughly. No longer
was it enough to show them their empty hands.
At night the sky reflects fires,
and in the morning old women search through the rubble
of bombed-out buildings. Sometimes I wonder
what they want, those idiots.

There are always the rumors. Uprisings in the countryside.
Schools and farms burned by terrorists. Or by militia.
Provincial capitals are retaken after capture.
Insurrections succeed, or are put down.
So and so has been shot, or has gone over to the other side.
A neighbor's wife has been betrayed by her children.
The wise man believes nothing,
trusts no one.        
Farming is always a pleasure. Laying a furrow
in the wet ground. Scattering seed in a wide arc,
and watching things grow. Feeding your corn to your pig,
and watching it grow. Feeding your pig to a stranger
who has lust for your daughter in his heart.

Then there's the one about the traveling salesman and the farmer's
daughter. It seems that after dinner they're all sitting around in
the livingroom, except for the daughter, who's supposed to be in bed,
but is actually on the top of the stairs, listening. And the salesman
is telling her daddy and brothers all about his wife, who's a bitch
and won't let him out when he's home. And his wife's sister, who eats
so much she's a cow, but he'd fuck her anyway if there was a flag
big enough. And how when he's out on the road all the chicks sail
for him, but they're mostly dogs or pigs or the horse's ass.
And at the top of the stairs, while he's catching his breath,
the daughter whispers down, "If yer tired o' critters,
whyn't yer try peoples fer a change."

But it's farming is the pleasure. And walking the woods with an ax,
picking a tree and chopping it down. The cutting of it into lengths
and laying it into the fire. Stepping out into the cold darkness
where the smoke drifts away toward the stars.        
They're pulling out. After all this time they're really leaving.
Where are they going? Who knows! Who cares! What are they
leaving behind? Nothing of any value to them. What are they taking
with them? Nothing that matters to us.

                                                          They left at night.
I didn't see them, but I heard their columns rumble through the street.
All night there were airplanes landing and taking off.
Jets were screaming.

Of our own free will, some of us went with them. A few
were needed and taken by force. To those who stayed,
the rest of us were dead. Flying into darkness, we saw
the last green fields of our homeland fading, dissolving.

Why should we have stayed? Most of them are like animals.
Why should we stay and die with them? There are always those
who are left behind. If we survive, if we succeed, we'll do
what we can for them.

But there's no future there to speak of. The future is above us,
dark and flecked with starlight, shot with brilliant sunlight.
The Earth lies far behind us, blue with swirl of clouds,
like the circle of sky at the top of a well.
I'd like to kill you.
Really, I would!
Imagine it. Here I am
hiding among these words and letters.
You sit out there peering at them intently,
failing to find any trace of me.
But then I spring, I leap at your throat,
clawing and ripping through flesh,
severing tendons, searching out your jugular.
Your blood spurts out upon this page,
blotting out letters and entire words, attempting
to destroy me. But I have already vanished,
and you, gentle reader, are dead.
                                The white lady,
whom we all do serve
                                  and honor as before,
         despite her changing faces

but have not known, or mastered,
                          though we have touched her
          as a servant
                          touches his lady's garment

whose dark phase portends disaster
                                         the quaking of cities,
                          spread of disease and pestilence,
          revolution and strife

whose shadow falling on the earth
         brings terror
                                and heartache
and darkness of night to the middle of day,

                          the white lady
turns her back on us,
        and facing her master
                          receives the flaming crown of heaven
        which she wears for only an instant
-- the instant of total eclipse --
                          and then returns to him,
          and slowly turns to smile on us again.
Now, when the cathedral
thrusts twin spires
upward into the darkness,
is when we live --
clamber over arch, buttress, tower,
tweak the noses of stoney-faced bishops,
mock and deride the virgins of downcast eyes,
gouge the wounds of martyrs with our claws,
perch on the heads of saints, shrieking.
And at dawn, when the Eye of God comes
peeping up over the horizon,
we go to our places and freeze,
spend our day waiting for night,
making faces at children sometimes.

***

I made this.
By which I mean I planned it, conceived it.
My friends and neighbors built it,
with their children through twenty generations.
And at what cost! Countless thousands devoting
their lives and wealth to it.
I myself grew old in the scaffolding,
never saw the whole of it, save with my mind's eye.
I have a small place in it, down low, under the pulpit.
From here I can see the rich and the poor,
the believer and the skeptic, the noble and the baseborn,
the citizen and the stranger -- my friends and neighbors
coming and going.  I did this for them,
and whatever it is they have chosen to worship here

***

The whole family except one, is here
down under the chancel.  Our places are marked
by marble slabs.  I've seen these when the curious,
with flickering candles, shuffle among us in the darkness.
To my right lies an uncle I never knew when alive.
Never at home, but always at war somewhere.  A bear of a man.
My father lies on my left.  Not a ver good likeness.
Beyond him is my mother.  I cannot see her.
Our family built this church, though during my time
it stood half-finished, and nothing much was dome about it.
Let's say there were more pressing needs just then.
The one who began it -- he lies upstaris in the chancel.
His tomb is gold.  He said, "I build this church for my people."
What a joke!

***

I've seen dozens of places like this.
This one is interesting, I'd say, but not exceptional.
It's right next to the railroad station, though,
and that's great.  You don't have to spend a lot of time 
looking for it.  During the summer, cathedrals are really
a blessing.  You can go inside and they're always cool.
But in fall or early spring, that's a bitch.  You can catch
your death.  This one has a beautiful organ.  I love it when 
you're in a church and the organ begins to play.
You can sit down in back then and listen to the music
and watch the sunlight coming through the stained-glass windows.
After a long, hot train trip, ther's nothing like finding
a nice, cool cathedral right next to the railroad station.
It's almost like coming to life again.
How does it work, your new machine?
Does it glide you slowly southward
over blue waters, singing love songs
in Greek to you as it goes?
You plug yourself in, and then sit
back and relax. Cozy, isn't it?
Just for you, constellations march
across the ceiling of your room, as
(blue metal finger at your pulse)
it monitors your precious heartbeat.
You fly through the densest atmosphere
without singeing a whisker. It holds you
in its arms and calls you "lover."
And when you went to sleep, you turned
it off, of course. But can you be sure?
No need to worry though. It only obeys.
No feelings or thoughts of its own. No dreams
for its future. No plan that it's shaping for yours.

***

One hovers near the other,
and if they brush harshly, one against the other,
the shower of sparks would ignite the universe.
They bob up and down on the airstreams,
sharply falling, and then rising steeply.
Drawing together, then drifting apart, metal
yearning for union with metal. They connect,
and the power contained in the one
flows into the other -- pulsing,
surging from one to the other.
Then comes the disconnection.
Then drifting apart, and sighing.
The high platform could easily be seen
for several steps in every direction.
And then dense underbrush would interpose itself.
The teeming plant-life making known its will.
The ones on the platform -- my job to watch them.

Their high platform: lowered in one piece from the sky,
crashing down through the upper branches, disturbing the birds
in their nests. Four long poles and a platform at the top.
Their poles had some spring, and did not snap. The platform
did bounces and tilts for a time, then righted itself.
Came to a standstill. Stood there.

By the waterpool, the two of them were making sounds to each other.
And I got close enough to hear one say, "One over six
by three is three over six or one over two."
The other nodded, "Yes."

Yet something essential was missing. The computations could not be
made that simply and still remain meaningful. Maybe it was the lack
of feeling in her voice. A case of simple innocence, perhaps.

The other spent his days collecting and labeling specimens.
He'd set snares for birds and fasten small metal tags
to their legs. He filled hundreds and hundreds of bottles
with dirt and cuttings of plants. A collector's collector.

The girl looked so bored, I thought I'd speak to her.
"Thirty-six is the square of six," I said, "and seven
is the root of forty-nine." Her eyes lit up, her face
began to shine. She ran to tell her boyfriend,
who reddened, first with anger, then with shame.
He said. "We're not supposed to know that now, I think."

But I guess you know the rest of their story. How their platform
toppled to the ground, all of his bottles smashed. And how,
through suffering, their life together suddenly took on
new meaning and purpose.
The sea is awash with petals of flowers.
It continues to sing its wild and simple song
and nobody minds. Here a squat, brown rock
suffers the sea to break over it endlessly,
over and over.

                        I cling to that rock --
yearning for the freedom of the sea, yet clinging
to the rock. The waves break over my shoulders.

Here waves lift themselves up, toss spume
like tiny blossoms to the wind. And gulls
slashing downward catch up small bits of life
the waves lift up to them.

                                       Yet the force that lifts
will pull them down again to lift them up
and pull them down endlessly, over and over.

I see myself lifted on a tide of flowers, broken
by a rock I had clung to, listening
to the singing of the sea.
It was on the island of Crete
that I began my self-portrait. Crete is the largest
and southernmost of the Greek islands. It was in early
March, 1973. The air was cool, and the sun was warm. The hillsides
were covered with flowers.

In March each year -- on the tenth of March to be precise --
I am halfway between one birthday and the next. So the tenth
of March has always seemed to me to be the pivot of my year.
I began my portrait of myself on the ninth of March,
just before the pivot of my year.

Crete was cool and green in the Mediterranean sunshine.
Oranges and lemons hung everywhere in great abundance. Lambs and
kids frolicked among the older sheep and goats. I was almost
precisely halfway through my thirty-seventh year.

Wildflowers blossomed everywhere -- at the seashore, on the lower
slopes of Mount Ida and Mount Lassithi, even among the ruins
of the great Minoan palaces. Only high peaks and valleys still lay
under snow. The Minoan world began to reach its greatest prosperity
around 1600 B.C., thirty-seven centuries ago. Maybe thirty-six.

So that's a kind of context, I suppose, for me. I'm thirty-six
now, and going on thirty-seven. Born on September 10, 1936.
And I can't tell if I'm rising or falling today.

***

On March 9, we camped in the hills above Knossos.
At the crest of a hill to the west, a low, white house
was outlined against the pinkish-gray sky. As I watched
the silhouette of a Peacock strode across its roof.

Barbie and I had been traveling on the continent of Europe
since a few weeks after my thirty-sixth birthday. By then
we'd visited Germany, Austria, Yugoslavia and Greece,
and had been briefly into Italy at Trieste.

If I were a painter, I'd rather be Bosch, Vermeer, or Klee
than Rembrandt, say, or Rubens. But I'd rather be Albrecht DÅrer
than almost anyone else. If I were a composer, I'd rather be German
than Italian. I'd rather be Beethoven than Bach, Mahler than Mozart.
And I really wouldn't mind being Wagner, Stravinsky, or Webern.
But I have up piano when I was twelve. Today, I travel and write.

***

Two donkeys moved in slow circles under the olive trees.
One was saddled, the other was not. This was near the monastery
of Preveli on the south coast of Crete. On March 18, a windy Sunday,
I finished work on my self-portrait.

For six days and five nights we camped in a beautiful valley
near the monastery, taking long walks through the hills
and along rushing streams. My self-portrait, I'd decided,
should be simple and direct. (Like DÅrer's in Munich,
I thought to myself.)

So, old clothes then, and nothing fancy. Just me as I am,
with a bit of Cretan springtime in the background. Two young
donkeys playing in an olive grove, one biting the bridle
of the other. Or a shepherd and his flock crossing a stream
by way of a hump-backed cobblestone bridge.

***

My eyes are blue, and in the portrait they look toward you,
but not directly at you, eye to eye. My moustache and beard
are reddish-brown. My hair, a trifle darker. The expression on my face
is somewhere between musing and amusement.

You see me from head to waist, wearing a tan shirt, somewhat frayed
at the cuffs. A small triangle of white undershirt shows at the base
of my throat. All of my buttons are buttoned but one.

So there I am. Just a man, thirty-six years old, who likes to write
and travel. A man who loves his wife and lives easily with her.
A man who looks out from his portrait and can almost see you.
His left hand holds a handful of flowers,
and his other hand is hidden.

At the bottom, right-hand corner of his portrait
I put my name and the date.

Ivan Ilyich is dead.
But I am alive. Yes, alive!
Waking in the night, I consider the similarities
between the unconsciousness I have just experienced
and death. From nearby comes the monotonous roaring
of a stream. It sounds like a radio left on
long after all the stations have, one by one,
signed off and shut down for the night.

"a sunlit unity,
desperately sought."

-Keith Wilson
this was
what it was, 
luminous, 
till at night 
it was dark in quiet rain 

a measured step 
in a dark place, 
breathing, regular as footfalls 
beneath the overhanging rock 

sometimes, driving on the highway 
between one valley town & another, 
i will see old women in black 
scratching the dust with sticks, 
or a man walking beside the road, 
followed by an ancient dog 
that trots across his path 
& glances up, eyes glazed 

in the falling particles of light 
the sudden sound of water flowing 
over rocks, around, beneath 
the roots of trees 
                           gathering 
in dark pools 
at our feet
these walls need 
not contain us 

there is a door, 
see, there are trees 

beyond, I will 
take your hand 

if you are afraid 

i like to think of my blood 
sailing with Erikson 
through the long and cold Atlantic night 
having turned West 
not in flight 
but in casual exploration, 
raising the green land at morning 
foraging the sparsely peopled shore 
and pushing West against the wind again.

we live 
on the surface 
of our skins 

water sliding 
in between, 
the window 

in our shower 
open, neighbors 
looking in 

not looking in, 
it hardly matters, 
your breasts 

slip from my hands, 
we love 
beneath the surface 

of our skins, 
in time & under 
water, we 

love 
& sink 
& swim
destroyed, she said her 
heart had been destroyed; 
the word came from her mouth 
as from an old, yellow-paged novel. 

lilacs, 
a trace of honeysuckle. 

                         weeds, growing in the rooms of an old house, 
                         razed to the ground.

destroyed. 

                         rooms, imagined, open to all weather. 
                         secrets withering in the foreign air. 

suddenly it opens 
suddenly 
it 
   opens 
the whole damn thing

            a woman 

i had never thought 
of wanting, never 
pursued 

             in the sudden down 
                                           pour

it had been always

against my wish

you are loved
trees in city streets 
when not in clumps or rows 
stand singly
shedding their leaves 
on sidewalks
feet seen through 
a basement window 
moving up 
or down a street 
sometimes pausing 
as though uncertain 
of where they are going 
or where they are
the uncertain traveler 
moves through a landscape 
in circles like leaves
rolling up the valley 
sunday afternoon 
each thing we look at 
single and itself -- 

a single boll of cotton in a field 
a splash of river in the sun 

& all things moving 
singly & together
you are loved 
& not alone: 
the cottonwoods, yellow 
by the river 
are with you, 
cool & clear 
october air 
is with you 
cool & clear 
unloved
& at night 
on the mountain over the city 
i said some words to you 
i had not thought to say 
& feeling you tremble, knew 
more than a name for you, Barbara 

this was the time 
he'd had enough -- 
                                        cold rooms & 
                                        empty arguments 
speaking, as though to a shadow 

he wanted to give it to strangers, 
cripples & misfits 
collected from 
all-night cafes 

high above the house 
he knew it was waiting 
pawing the ground, tail to the wind

saying goodby 
is no trouble: 

a house is a skin 
to be shucked 

wriggled out of 
room by room 

closet by closet 
until what remains 

is piles of boxes, 
a few empty hangers, 

a heap of debris 
on the kitchen floor 

which never seemed so wide, 
a neighbor's dog 

who come to say goodby 
from a respectable distance. 

a desolation of friends 
parting in the early evening, 
dry voices under a closing sky. 
                               she turns 
to him, the one remaining, watches him 
watching the other, moving away. her hand 
at his sleeve, reminding and warning. 

there will be times in the changing light 
we cannot see each other's faces.
those 
who depart 
are always 
dead 

and i 
am the one 
who stays 
always
nights i go to the school 
i make marks with chalk 
on the green blackboard 

say words 
of a certain order 
and consistency 

at 10:00 i go home 
take off my tie 
say nothing 

stroke the cats
the moon 
swings 
high the 
desert 
catches 
light 
& throws 
it back 
again
walking with you 
on the ditch-bank 

                                    warm october air 
                                    cottonwoods 
                                    starting to turn 

sad to think 
one day we may walk here 
pretending to be lovers once again
when the wind died 

the rain fell straight. 
when the rain ceased to fall 

and we could no longer smell 
creosote in the air, the other 

odors returned. sweat and piss 
and decay. the stench of dying 

angels on the grass.
milwaukee, wisconsin. sometime 
near the beginning of the war. 
a 4th of july parade, amid news 
paper reports of bodies found 
dismembered, dumped in trashcans 
along the lake michigan beaches. 

        we decorate our tricycles 
        with fireproof red white & blue 
        streamers. we pump along the route, 
        waving our flags, grinning 
        at patriot parents. later 

that summer i fell in a lake 
& survived. my too-old-for-the-war 
uncle began to teach me to swim. 
arms out. legs out. face 
in the water, holding my breath: 
learning to live, practicing death. 

feel it 
press- 
ing at 

your finger 
tip, feel 
the stress 

line run- 
ning from 
its heart 

to yours 

the comfort i had expected 
came to nothing 

a hard dream, green 
walls, black sea 

the last wish for 
an angel . . . 

              blonde, 
nameless
we stood there, 
figures in a landscape of our own imagining 
wondering when to begin 
                                                 probing our resources, 
the uncertain foundations of our knowledge 
& seeking to distinguish 
what was ours 
                              from the universal 
underground rivers 
                                     gave us sustenance 
though we in no way sought it
& the room in which we sat 
was floating free in the blackness of space 
& us tourists at the windows, taking snapshots 
fully expecting them to yield images 
perfect & holy
you cannot dream 
you are something 
inanimate, he was told 

but he dreamt, he 
dreamt he was a stone 
lying at the bottom 
of a clear, cold, swiftly-flowing stream 

& someone kneeling on the bank 
picked him up, put him in his pocket, & carried him away 

to a small town, 
took him out of his pocket 
polished him tenderly with a soft cloth 
threw him through a window of a small house 

where, on a living room carpet, 
he was suddenly at home
there were things he could speak of 
to no one 
          & having no confessor 
he would write them in narrow-lined notebooks, 
locking them first in a drawer of his desk, 
then piling them on a closet shelf, 
burning them finally & stirring the ashes with a stick 

one night, on a bus to Montreal, 
he unburdened himself to the wife of a man he didn't know, 
who listened in the darkness 
& carried it away 
with her
there is no warning, you won't recognize anyone, 
the walls of their rooms will be bare 
their floors, uncarpeted 

if you look into their eyes 
they will stare blankly into yours 
until you turn away 

& when you leave, if you leave 
they will not say goodby 
or warn you of where you are going
she knew the habits of his mind, 
how in the basest of cities 
he would prowl the streets 

looking for god knows what 
or avoiding . . . 
                         would it be her? 
& coming back to her 
after three days once 
spending his time 
with who knows what seedy friends 
in Lexington Avenue bars 

coming back to her 
without apologies 
without, it seemed, 
regret at having to come back 

but only to be gone again someday
it was cold, he felt 
that his flesh was rotting 

the notion trembled 
on the brink of war 

yesterday's newspaper 
lined his shoes 

& the little boy 
his hand in his mother's -- 

                   who is that funny man, 
                   why is he on our side of the street
what she feared was a life 
among strangers, among 
those whose hearts 
are unreadable in their faces, 
untouchable, 
those whose eyes say 
you are not one of us 
you are not from here 
you are alien, foreign 
even that you are 
is doubtful
he liked to pretend 
he was somebody else, 
go up to a girl in the bus station 

strike up a conversation, 
buy her a beer, or a cup of coffee, 
telling her he was a rich Texas oilman 

maneuvering her to a nearby hotel, 
listening to her life story 
getting her to bed 

                            disappearing 
before she wakes up, 
not for a moment believing 
she was who she said she was
no good, their trying for it, 
they made love quietly 
out of old habit 

sometimes so close to 
something, of which they dared 
not speak to each other 
so close 
they could nearly 
touch it --
having spoken, he would now remain silent 
give them time to digest his remarks 
& act upon them 

if they chose not to . . . well, 
that was their business 

no fault of his 
if they, through their own blindness 
& stupidity, brought disaster upon all their heads 

                                       give a fool his head 
                                       & you give him nothing
the female animal-tamer 
reclining on leopard-skin pillows 
surrounded by an all-male, animal cast 

                       the problem, he finds, is achieving 
                       incident, without detracting 
                       at the same time from the central voluptuary 

teeth bared, breasts prominent, hips 
curving toward oblivion 
                                     whip in her hand
into that consequence 
of dreams 
he had not knowingly 

dreamt, 
under the darkest 
of moons, 

seeming 
to know 
but the end 

of it, 
moving 

it was no night for me, 
no night for walking streets, waking dogs 
who always wake & bark at people walking 
late at night it seems 
                       no night for 
looking for the window of a certain girl 
more beautiful than any, a girl 
who undresses for bed & stands 
each night, in the light at her window 
offering herself to the eyes of the first passer-by, 
turning her lights off & slipping into bed 
a fraction ahead of my lurching around the corner 

just between us -- 
she doesn't understand me, 
never has 
                seems to want 
a father, not a man 
                              turns away 
whenever we're in bed 

so, you know, a little trip to Juarez 
now & then 
                    understand me, 
it's not that I don't love her 

		she'd never understand
hearing him say it -- i love you, 
two days in the country 
an abandoned farm he knew about 

the long bus ride 
& him at the end of it, 
grinning 

awaking naked 
hay in her hair 
nipples erect in the cold sun 

it seemed she had only dreamed it 
& country was far away 

between the beginning of it 
& now, so much time 
had passed he had forgotten 
the purpose of it 
                                                     the persistent anger 
                                                     he wore each day 
                                                     like a garment 

there were times he could be caught out of it, 
be caught in a smile 
or a broken laugh 

someone would point, & he 
would put it on again, 
feeling his nakedness 

tonight he finds her unyielding, 
remote & hard, not coy 
                              you only 
love me for my body, is what she says 

which is the truth, but he 
won't tell her that yet 

coming across trees 
parched & angry 
deciding that she 
deserves whatever happens 
to her now, finding 
water in the shadow -- 
					to sleep then & wake 
                                             conscious perhaps 
                                             that some things were 
                                             not as bad as they'd seemed 

relaxing, forgetting 
shooting a rabbit for supper 

it was something about the shoes, 
the way they pinched when she walked, 
that brought her back 

he fetched another pair from the rack 
at the back of the store, 
slipped one on 

holding her right ankle in his left hand 
wanting never to let go, 
but letting go & never 

seeing her again

the walk through the fields 
they had looked forward to, 
she in her way, he in his 

at a certain point 
he would take her hand 
& lead her to a grassy spot 

where they undressed, lay down, made love, 
as they had each summer of their life together, 
she, watching the clouds float 

thinking -- 
things like this 
should have their own & proper names 

this full-grown, clown of a man 
walking out with her 
on the beach every day 

telling her jokes 
picking up colored stones 
& showing them to her 

did he like to pretend 
he was her father 

he liked to watch her
from the corners of his eyes 

                      the half-inch of white flesh 
                      at the edge of her bikini, 
                      the gentle curve of her breasts 

at the door of her room 
he would have liked to touch her 

she seemed suddenly angry 

did she like to pretend 
he was her father 

something about the doctor's eyes, 
a shiftiness perhaps, unsettled her 
causing her to pause 
in the ritual disrobing; 
                                 beyond 
the window there was nothing 
until, below, in the street, a bustle of traffic 

he felt her recoil from the cold 
of the stethoscope, he thought 
she had called him by his christian name, 
which was Charles 

there were times that he wanted to kill himself 

at times it seemed to him 
that consciousness was all 
there was to it, that nothing 
further was called for 

in such moments he would take pleasure 
in recalling to his fingers 
the feel of a knife 
slicing into flesh 

forgetting the feel of his flesh 
straining toward the knife, 
as though darkness 
was all that was called for

the thing was white, 
it had white eyes, white claws, 
white hairy armpits 

the sky & ground were winter white 
as the thing crept toward him over the snow 
slowly, flashing the whitest of teeth, 
whistling whitely under its breath 

during the night, 
yells & screams, occasionally 
the sound of someone running through the street 

there was the knocking at the door, & then 
he fell asleep, dreamt of a girl 
he had known in another war 

in the morning he arose & opened his door, 
they were hauling away the dead bodies 
hauling away the dead bodies 
hauling him away 

her two legs 
passing each other with each step, 
breasts, bouncing slightly 

slightly smiling 
at men who will never 
possess her, their fond eyes 

& instantly knowing 
the sharp, bright eyes 
that do not turn 
away
in the image of themselves, to be 
uncovered, shown for what they are 
& never let to sleep without the dream 
made for themselves 

to be opened, as with knives, 
their innards read for futures, 
projected on the walls of a cell 

sickening & dying
he spoke to her quietly 
in a nickels & dimes sort of way 
but touched 
on the prospects before them, 
hinting at problems 
she was unconscious of, 

                       she standing in their back door, 
                       watching the sun set behind the mountain 

thinking how lovely 
it was in the evening there
after new year's, 
back in the office, 
telling them how it 

had been, how he 
had met her in 
Times Square, at 

midnight, as the ball 
was falling, & buying 
her a drink, taking 

her home with him, 
she, lightly laughing, 
waving a hand, how 

in the darkness she 
bloomed, a pale rose, 
opening, in the early 

hours of the year, 
accepting him, taking 
him into her, & he 

seeing in their eyes now, 
they didn't see it 
like it was
Bill & Joey were friends, they sat 
next to each other in school, 
read the same books, talked to 
the same pretty girls, who couldn't 
talk about either of them without 
mentioning the other in the some breath, 
the some breathless way 

when school was over, Joey or Bill would say -- 
walk me home & then I'll walk you home 

so, together they'd walk the sidewalks 
between their two houses & all the girls 
would envy each of them 

in Juarez 
one Pedro Morales, a civil servant 
roams the streets, throwing poisoned meat 
to the dogs, flinging 
their deflated carcasses 
onto the back of his truck 

farther south 
the Federales burn marijuana patches 
& poppy fields 

in many parts of the world 
men stoop to the doors of ovens & furnaces 
banking the coals, faces the color of fire 

Pedro Morales watches 
the burning of his dogs, the firing 
of the oven, the flaming village 

behind him 
his shadow 
takes on heroic proportions 

it was never like that, 
our memories play tricks on us 
in this place 

the day you burned your hand, remember? 
almost like any other but for that 
& yet it seems less ordinary 

 * * *

but what does ordinary mean, when we speak 
of the days of our lives 
the living of our days 

                            there were places that we liked, 
                            the walks along the river, high 
                            mountain lakes 

                            people would come and go, 
                            & we would like 
                            many of them 

rarely, a walk in the rain 

 * * *

looking back, we see it, see the peaks 
& valleys of it, but without 
the passion, the exertion of it 

this place is another world & we 
look out through the window of it 
on the other, where we were, lifeless
several moments of silence 
& then the beginning: 

               a hand raised
               & frozen
               in a gesture

which may have been 
threatening
three days of rain-swept streets & sidewalks 
people neither coming in nor going out 

our meals brought in to us on trays 
thunderclaps rattling the cups in their saucers
rumors of history 
a blinding flash of light 
the radios all silent now 

too late for love, she says 
& reaches for the sugar
the dead bird rises, 
              the dead girl walks by the river 

her breasts, 
                                  her face 
              more radiant than in life		
& likewise here, 
the living will walk among the dead & the unborn 

    & their glances, 
                         their curses, 
from another time 
                         which is the same time, 
    shall fall 
heavily upon our shoulders 
consciously, 
the rear guard was massacred 
under the eyes of the silent, yellow flowers 

a bird 
flew straight to the cottonwoods 

                                         look                 come 
                                         hear                 feel 

                   october rocks the mind
did something move, 
was there a word 
i didn't hear 

                                 the sagebrush has come 
                                 into flower 
                       was there 
                        anything 
                                  else
these same small birds 
this rough-hewn wood 
these figures carved in weathered stone 

                                    it is unknown 
                                    whether those 
                                    living in this forest 
                                    are priests or gods 

             the man who lives in the cottage by the river
             claims that the forest is uninhabited,
             he worships the thunderer
             & the three mothers

                                   through the door we heard music 
                                   though no one answered when we knocked 

                                   looking through the windows told us little
                                   about the inhabitants of the place 

                                   the kitchen was a clutter of utensils 
                                   a fire was burning in the den 

                                   a white, blue-eyed cat slept on the neatly-made bed 
                                   the dog slept near the door, the bird on its perch 

                                   there was no one there, we saw this 
                                   & went back into the trees

riverman came from the lakes where the big stones are, 
came here looking for people, looking for women 

             riverman found two girls, abandoned in the woods,
             took them home, blonde, blue-eyed girls

                          riverman took his pleasure with them, took
                          his ax then, chopped them down 

                                   a fire burning, at the mouth of his cave,
                                   this happened many times, fire burning many times

by the river 
perfectly reflected 
cottonwoods cottonwoods 
reflected perfectly 
by the river
a small sky, red shadows 
opening the mountains 
to the turning wind 

a girl moving leaves 
with a small foot
when i first spoke 
it was in a park 
it was almost sundown 
i was hungry, i said to 
she seemed to have heard 
but turned 
                                        her eyes followed the sun 
                                        i said i hadn't slept 
for three days 
hadn't even closed my eyes 

putting a finger to her lips, she smiled 
& called me to her 
with a sweet charity 
i hadn't known
was in her nature

 * * *

                         only the utmost restraint
prevented my rushing forth
to kill both of them
                             the two of them
wallowing in the grass
she, taking his cock in her mouth
like a common whore
                                 sucking it
until he came, shot his seed
into her throat
his people were a proud & ancient race,
they would never let a crime
against their house & name
pass unavenged

it was through the gray, slanting rain
they rode out, fifty strong,
armed to the teeth

the hooves of their horses
made sucking sounds
in the wet ground

three days later the women
saw them return: bloody,
unlaughing

 * * *

the young boy watched himself
moving over the meadow to her

                      country girl,
                      sitting under a tree

                                  waiting for him
                      or another

they were in this place where the land
stretched level for miles,
unbroken but for the raised stones,
an occasional prefabricated house,
a television tower blinking off & on

they were in love, riding along in
a second-hand car; there was something
in the air that made them expect
to see the sea come up over the horizon

the horizon came & went, another
took its placeno sea;
more stones, another grubby cottage

one country out of
many that they didn't know 
this is the place of torments,
the place where all things come together

this is the place of pleasure,
where all things come together
listen to what she said:

                            in the dark angles & secret places
                            of this room, where sea-wail can be heard
                            through chinks in the stone

                            in the deepest shadows of the night,
                            by the dripping walls

                            you may stretch forth your hand
                            & receive everything

After the armies have passed
and we stand in the doorways
of our ruined, staring faces
wondering if we are safe,
the smell of pestilence comes
carried by our memories
stronger than words, and more true.

You have heard me without speech,
you have smiled, and consented
that we must leave ourselves here
burnt beyond recognition
as a gift to our old friends
who can remember nothing
but the quarrels and the tears.

Then we will force ourselves on
across the broken country
through the darkness of our thoughts:
it will be night, raining, cold,
two sick dogs will follow us
until we have disappeared
into our own silences.
No one expected children:
they had spoken in clear words
of grassy plains with low trees
rising, falling like the sea
below vague and paling skies
not these hot damp jungle trails
choked by the flesh of children.

You're safe inside the movies
where everyone has his place
in the night among the stars
and voices and music play
what you want to know again
and you see yourself alive
doing what the others do.

The river was full of fish,
they said, but who could catch them?
It is like my memories,
I think, green, wild and shallow
through those harsh, broken passes,
and polluted by this town
to which it brought all my life.

On the beach, beneath the sun,
as though waiting for the tide
or the return of heaven,
stomachs, endless hordes of them
nothing else but parasites,
sacks of meat with living mouths
the beginning, and the end.

Forever and forever
these stone streets cross in my mind
like the place where I was born:
that quarter of the first town
preserved beneath the ruins
of your various new lives,
though no one knows it is there.

We'd come so far together,
struggling like two old convicts
sharing the risk of capture
and a minimum of food;
why did we quarrel right here,
just in sight of the border,
when neither could pass alone?

If after these corridors
and beyond those unlocked gates
there were beautiful persons
holding presents in their hands,
you might go on pretending
that you are talking to me
and that I want to listen.
While I stood there in shame,
not sure if I should watch
or run to look for help
or run and save myself,
they fought over your hands
like drunk barbarians.

So good to me they'd been,
speaking with ten fingers
the language of the birds
that wake before morning,
as if they saw our thoughts
and flew from our mute hearts.

Now they are hard and cold,
broken off at the wrists,
senseless as the gestures
scattered through those lost rooms
these archaists restore
who can conjure their warmth?

Or read their troubled lines?
Gone with all the rest, gone,
like the secret of your life
that came to me but once
with the body we shared
before we turned to stone.

Later, when I saw you,
you spoke to me, still kind,
as though nothing had happened
beside those buried years,
as though now you triumphed
in giving birth to me.
As though, as though, as though!

Let me say what is true:
once you held full hands out
in the terror of love,
and took them back, empty.
It happened long ago.
  Beneath those blank skies,
  speechless, silent, stilled,
  blind as stones frozen
  under the snowfields,
  forgotten by life,
  everyone was dead.

  In those winter woods
  nothing but the wind
  hard among the trees,
  some small birds flitting
  through their bleak branches
  more like moths than birds.

  Hoping for something
  I stopped to listen:
  a trunk swayed, creaked,
  somewhere a twig cracked,
  once a crow cried out,
  a dog barked, far off.

  They came at me then
  along the snowpaths
  pointing their fingers:
  You! Liar! Coward!
  Have you come here now
  to carve your own name?
The doors had each been closed
when the sun smiled and struck;
but you remained outside
waiting for the robins,
as though they would fly back
to start your life once more.

All the others were here
come to hide from that light,
people who seemed like us:
they had stared at the stars
and sung back to silence,
vanished now, like the past.

But where had summer gone?
Far into the future,
like the love of hybrids
or strange simple fossils
rising in new mountains,
not yet a memory.

I called to you, I called
from behind my tired eyes,
because I was afraid
you would be lost out there,
wounded by the morning
and changed away from me.

How much I wanted you!
Now that we were all here
and locked in for the day,
we played in our torn beds,
pretending we were safe,
pretending we were young.

But you never answered,
and you never returned.
So that I taught myself
the things I thought I'd need:
I learned how to keep time,
I made an alphabet,
I showed the children death.
And when I rummaged in you
I found some bad romances,
their pages marked by a girl;
some stained teeth like buttons,
stale kisses older than love,
fake pearls, a bible, a muff.
None of it belonged to you.

But our secret's forgotten
when fanatic childhood goes,
just like the combination
of that favorite old lock.
When you asked me to find it
you meant to make me happy,
the old dog with his old trick.

A vacation wouldn't work
best move on, just move away.
A walk through the museum,
though, to recall those old times,
preserved like premonitions
of our coming helplessness,
and then we would be ready.

One day he put on his best
and went out to see the town.
One day he threw a big party.
One day he ran round the house,
naked, roaring like a beast.
One day he played his records.
One day he wouldnt get up.

She wanted to very much.
Nothing fitted anything
although each had its own name
and belonged to her by right:
she nourished all her parts
as if she were a garden
that he would come to enjoy.

Still you couldn't understand.
There was blood on everything,
a network of molecules
enormous, invisible,
and neither dead nor alive.
It is the same everywhere.
We must bend our heads and drink.

It was an endless parade,
and they jammed Sixth Avenue:
Armies, Navies and Airplanes,
Clerks, Workers and Bosses,
Actors, Dancers, Deep Thinkers ...
I knew you waited for me,
but I couldn't cross the street.
You raided our sepulchers,
for trinkets hacked up our graves
and ripped these numbed bones apart;
now we lie, restored, exposed,
scattered among broken tools
and blurred lines of joys we took,
but will never give to you.

That hair that held me to you,
thick as waterweeds, summer,
and smelling of moist, bright skin,
that hair you wore has vanished
as though my life had been kept
in these crushed blue pigeon's eggs
thrown down from our tree today.

Out of my mouth those people
born like insects underground
swarmed up in black, humming elouds
and obscured the afternoon;
they were the barbarians
we had long been waiting for,
and we tore down these dead walls.

We can go where we damned please
as long as we look alive,
because the roads are open
right across the old mountains,
and because you remembered
a place that had sun and sky,
though you forget where it was.

I stood on a frozen street
right in the middle of town,
waiting with all the others
for a break in the weather
or a pretty girl to show.
When she came, weeping, naked,
no one would toss her his coat.

Suppose everything were glass,
the walls windows everywhere,
and through our transparent world
the fire of its core shone clear:
wouldn't you help me up then,
and wouldn't you understand
how much it hurts to love you?

There was no one in the room,
the mirror lied: lied lied lied!
Whenever she telephoned
she was frightened by his voice
Do this that and the other
as if there was time to think,
as though she were still alive.
You had hidden it from me
better than ever before.
I ransacked all your beauties
yet you made no resistance
to my terrible demands.
When I had finished, you said
"The place is inside the sun."

And then we fell fast asleep.
You dreamed that others would come,
bringing flowers and creamed cakes
like kind foreign gentlemen,
while I made good my escape
from that house of correction.
When we woke it was snowing.

Years later you dug me up:
rough bronze was what I'd become,
corroded by my own thoughts.
Yet neither could remember
what my purpose must have been
or how the way had been lost,
though we were just at our spring.

Oh we laughed when I came home
blackened and clawed by the sun
and that proud of my fat catch.
There was too much for us,
so you called our close friends in
to feast them on our blessings.
That night my fear filled the house.

And on the way from summer,
climbing through the mountains
up that unfamiliar road,
we slowed for breath near the top:
to the East lay our old seas
like the memories of birth,
like the shore we'd abandoned.

I was not one to sorrow
because I had died so soon
you could eat our fruit alone.
So that autumn's come, and cold,
and you walk through maple groves
hearing only your footsteps
crush these bloody, brittle leaves.

You'd nowhere else to hide it:
I had crossed your continent
and swum out from your last rocks,
dazzled by that blind daylight
where you stand with open hands
like a loving wife, and say
"The place is inside the sun.
A chest of old remedies
dried up and dusty with age
was all that remained to us
of our dozen long winters.
When that spring sickness returned
we were not prepared for life.
That was why we quarreled so.

How many fixed, faceless eyes
have you glanced into, curious,
in that fearful cut instant
of passage on the curved roads?
Invented by their own thoughts,
human more or less human,
these, the beings of the road.

Had I ever won gambles
I might have stopped this cheating.
My children are taught the law:
they gaze at me with calm eyes,
their faces clear as flowers,
empty of hope, or pity,
empty of comprehension.

Mouth to mouth, in our bodies
we found this ancient district
dying in our lost city
where we wait for each other
watching the late traffic run
recklessly with gouging lights
through cold stone streets past locked doors.

I wanted to find that book.
You never heard of that book?
He could not finish that book.
She wished she had read that book.
Had they always known that book?
We will need to have that book.
Was it after all that book?

In the darkness of your room
the smell of fish, weedy brine
and rotting mussels grows harsh
as though the sea had rolled up
pouring in over my life,
and ebbed, and left these ruins,
when the moon dropped from the sky.

Everything held the secret
and everyone talked at once,
openly, simply, with smiles
that seemed to welcome one in
as if we could understand,
as if we had always known
what was to be done with us.
And when the box was opened
it was a wedding present
brought by barbarous uncles
don't you remember the words,
that old music, the dancing,
cakes and wine and so much food
and how everyone kissed us?

And afterwards, when they left,
when we were alone at last,
poking through those gay ruins,
late towards our first morning,
when we were too tired to laugh,
we found it in a corner,
trembling in terrible fright?

And how we waited awhile
wondering what it could mean,
until the sun filled the room,
giving us no other choice
don't you remember it now?
how we threw ourselves down then,
and how we killed it, and ate?
Outside, the great gray boles
of the silent elm trees,
the suffering elm trees,
swayed in the storm's first winds.

Then massed low winter clouds
heaved and shifted and rolled
relentless over us
out of those torn black hills.

Inside, in our bedroom,
surrounded by roses
fading on the five walls,
we lay and watched it come.

We had no strength to move
together or apart,
but lay there cold, frightened,
waiting for each other.

Nothing we knew of life,
after ten years nothing,
but that the works of love
had passed with their seasons.

Then in that room's quiet,
as that house groaned and cracked,
there were words, whispered words
seeping like dust from those walls.

Dry spinsterish voices
insisted, insisted
we must quit, we must die:
there was no more to hope.

We listened, we listened
for hours to that sadness,
holding each other tight
tight, tight. Until we wept.
They all wandered in vague circles,
eating what they found or might catch,
sleeping where they dropped, night or day.
They survived, and told themselves tales:
We want nothing but this desert,
we are safe here, watched by angels,
and fitted for the lives we lead
these beaks, these strong legs for our shells.

Centuries and centuries off,
as though it were there, virtual,
over this plunging, dim canyon,
across that flat waste of mesquite,
beyond that ridge of stonedry hills,
like a spring of cold, fresh water,
is the place I have headed for,
each day one step, one step each night.
Your highways are open
and littered with bones,
but beyond the barbed wires
as far as they can see
your gentle land rolls brown
and waistdeep in summer.

They're crossing the high plains
at eighty miles an hour;
the noise of the radio,
the noise of the motor,
the noise of the parched wind,
batters them hard, like lust.

You have never seen them.
Or if you have, you think:
I'm sick of those drivers
all alike in their cars,
covered with sour dust,
hands trembling from the wheel,

thin long legs cramped like crows'
and pants creased at the crotch,
voices cracked with misuse
and thirst and loneliness
behind those sunglasses
burnt eyes burning at me.

And you think: They stop here
because I'm beautiful,
because I might want them.
They know you're not, you don't.
Supposing they were free?
There's nowhere else to go.
There it was in your room,
dead, still warm but yes dead,
and you were the killer,
and no one else had come,
and no one had seen it
or heard that loud struggling.

What to do? It was late,
but never late enough.
You had friends, yet were they?
People seem skeptical
of someone else's luck;
police of course are worse.

Every old story
of every such room
came back to fill that night,
until you thought you'd wake
insane with hopeless fear
and never get out free.

There was one solution,
though, there was one for you
tools lay in the drawers
and dishes on the shelves:
you cut, you trimmed, you cooked.
You sat. You ate yourself.
            
            He was very busy, he said,
            he had to finish a big job
            he took on a long time ago,
            something to do with his uncle
            the Button King of Babylon:
            the old man had made a shrewd fortune,
            but as for handing it around
            he was tight as an old maid's cunt.
            So that was that, and there I was
            out in the cold as usual
            asking myself if I was nuts;
            but it was good, and I knew it,
            this time I knew it like I knew
            the next one turning that corner
            was a nigger without a coat,
            red eyes burning me through the snow.
            It wasnt even even dough;
            I could have gotten ten to one,
            lookten to one on a sure thing!
            Let the folks have first crack at it,
            I thought; it's absolutely safe
            and all they're risking is the nut
            like ten to one on this dollar
            next chick round is hustling supper.
            Just because they own the whole town
            they think they're like god or something.
            It's ten to one in your favor,
            and you dont have to do a thing,
            I told them, but believe in me
            that this time it wasnt a hunch.
            So? So I asked the old woman
            to turn a trick once more. She did.
Across the room, that woman
watched him with her hard brown eyes,
eyes bulging through their own strain
as he talked of those great eyes
that had vanished from our books.
"One would say we'd lost our souls."
Soft, gray, luminous, his eyes.

Once, and only once, I gazed
into eyes I'd never seen.
Though they showed no friendliness
they held no senseless hatred.
Wise they seemed, more than patient.
Yet when I smiled they mocked me
in return. Those eyes were mine.

When, over a filing case,
your hands paused and turned their palms
to reveal the strange pattern
in their lines, like the numbers
of one of those who lived on
after their own extinction,
I dared look up at your eyes.

In the streets I hunted their eyes
like an addict seeking friends
or a sad cruising fairy.
Towards evening, perhaps,
the fever would burn me out
and I might go home and eat,
as if I too were human.
                                   
Lambs, rabbits, calves, scalded swine,
turkeys, geese, fish and lobsters
all the market's opened eyes,
edible and as blind as ours.
Admiring, we wandered through,
choosing among slaughtered friends
heads we hungered to devour.

That blind girl wished she could see
what we looked like in our flesh.
To us she was beautiful
and could not know what we knew:
that we looked at her with joy
but never at each other,
for we feared to see ourselves.

Your mouth waited for my kiss,
your eyes opened like morning
and I came to you gladly.
Inside your eyes it was night,
empty, illimitable,
through which I fell, forever,
towards remote, beating stars.
Under the ceiling the smoke
wallowed yet, stained, usedup smoke;
the fire dropped into cinders,
throwing cracked glcams against them
where they sprawled, stale and stupid
in the trash of broken lives
they would nevcr need again.

I climbed over their bodies
up the steep and littered stairs
turning only once to look
at what we had been doing
during that long evening,
as though I would forget it
in a lifetime of evenings.

Shining on the crusted snow
the light of a cold, late moon
spilled the silent rooms with ice;
sornewhere a branch scraped the wall;
somewhere a tap was dripping;
and somewhere a girl sobbed
softly and beyond control.

Down that strict bleak hall I went,
past exhausted bedrooms
towards the malicious door
that had resisted my strength
till nowwhen it was so late
when it swung in like a trap
upon your naked laughter.
The icicles were dripping
and the cold gray clouds hung low;
the taps were in the maples,
the snowfields heavy, sunken.
White houses stained by winter
waited for the thaw to end,
and everyone had the flu.

If they werent stupid drunk.
There was enough to go round,
yes, of everything but good words,
laughter, and a friendly touch.
And what did we talk about
in those Adirondack days?
We were afraid of the Jews.

Our young physicist sang hymns
what Sundays he didn't ski.
All I knew of my best friend
was: he hit what he aimed at
and shot at everything,
his wife went to bed at eight
believing she was a witch.

How much warm milk with honey
do you think you can swallow?
Those winters are very long.
At the end we hunted ghosts
with music and candlelight:
Huron, Mohawk, Iroquois
not one of them came to help.

I think something had gone wrong.
When the wet spring was rained out
those hot summer storms began:
people with incomes drove off
as those old shanties choked up
with black Southern families
trucked north to stoop for our beans.

It was a poor land round there,
living from the catalogue;
we found nothing to bid for
at their Saturday auctions
but ourselves, and we were poor.
Still if we'd offered these souls
would they know what they were for?

Some had babies, some tumors;
it was a lively piece of news
when Margaret's dinner burned;
a life of old storm windows
to be put up, taken down.
Those who survived would live on,
past eighty. The rest were dead.
"In my old age I have grown
abundant and determined,"
William Butler Yeats declared,
failed painter turned poet.
While I, writing thirty years,
consign my fictions to hell,
for they were but fictions all.

My eyes belong to my' head,
and my head is full of eyes:
ten thousand words wouldnt do
to make an image, not one,
that should be as clearclearer
as the things I think they see
waiting patiently in me.

There is space, and there is fire;
there are bodies everywhere:
some are worlds, some barren stones,
some, like women stripped, bodies
nacreous or rose or masked,
lie hiding in their own forms
waiting patiently for me.

One year I pierced my canvas
with flame to get past those shams
of painted cloth; the next year
drilled through the wood I worked on,
painting breasts like eyes or stars
places' I wanted to reach,
waiting patiently for me.

Nothing satisfies for long:
the brush the hand, or the forms
they throw out and leave behind
as though they shaped in my mind
merely to make me lose heart
because I see too much in here
waiting patiently for me.

But I know just what I want
as if it were there for me,
there between my brush's tip
and the blank bright canvas wall:
it isathing visible,
substanceless yet more than real,
waiting patiently for me.

Waiting patiently for me
at that hour when I wake
undressed by sleep, such small sleep,
a few moments out of life
in the arms of the one wife
I have always known as you,
you wait patiently for me.
I had failed all of their tests
but you still believed in me
as if they didn't matter,
as though you were my real friend.
Get out, get away from me,
take the sun with you, and leave:
you don't need me anymore.

She was singing to herself
from the night that she was born,
and listening to her song
we could hear, or thought we heard,
There's an angel in a star,
and he burns my life away
yet where are they, where are they?

They chose and chose and chose and
still I wasn't ehosen in.
It was my bad luck, they laughed;
and when I dared to complain
they threw stones and knocked me down.
"Only fools cry," Father said,
"Look, your name is on that stone."

Our war began in springtime.
That summer we planned our fort,
eollecting stuff to build it
and storing up the weapons.
When fall came round we waited,
watching the four streets all day.
Winter buried us with snow.

While my legs were in the cast
I had only this window.
Before the sun set she came
by herself and played that game.
I held my breath. Long long long.
Later I ran and told her.
Is that why she hates me so?

Always he'd love me, always.
And he showed me his closet,
which was like death, and naked.
But he knew where the fish were,
there, hidden in the deep pool,
after the woods, by the glade.
Yet I liked the quiet one.

Come here, they said, and do this.
Sit there, they said, and eat that.
Get up, lie down, go to sleep.
They said they said and they said.
There was just one place to hide
when all the others had been found:
here, where no one can see us.
It was a voice at morning
and again at the sunset:
words singing themselves, strange words,
old words, older than the world,
words not in any language,
though sometimes they seemed out there,
sometimes in here, in ourselves.

When I woke up, my father
stood there in the moon's shadow,
and I smelled the blood on him.
We were to run together
all night to the place prepared
long ago by the old ones.
There I would become a man.

So many came into me,
thrusting, heavy, whispering,
none the same yet all the same,
as though I was what they wished.
At noon, in the sun, I laughed,
and they turned away with shame.
What did they know, those children!

Once it had been 50 simple:
we walked in a great circle,
thrice round, and we understood.
When that circle was broken
and nothing could hold us back,
it all changed: now there were stars:
stars behind stars behind stars.

And the tribes fought each other,
the beasts, the birds, the fish, trees,
insects, the worms in the earth,
all intent upon their lives
in mutual, silent war,
as though the world would be theirs
yet the mountain only slept.

I did not see what it meant
when you showed me house and field,
man and woman, and asked me
with your good smile to come in.
There was much work to be done,
the work of ten thousand years,
done, undone, before the end.

Our home crumbled at a touch,
like an apple made of dust.
We drifted away, apart,
out into the night of cold:
bits, fragments, brittle crystals
in which our selves had been sealed,
nameless now, and beyond death.
The mines had been sealed off,
the cities forbidden;
winds stripped away the soil
and filled the rivers in;
but the killing went on
as though they wished to die.

The roads were blocked with cars
in which sat stubborn men
cradling guns in their laps,
and women whose faces
would never smile again,
long, dry, childless faces.

They sat inside themselves
waiting like emigrants
for permission to move
until the crisis passed,
the last of their crises
in what seemed a lifetime.

And when they looked outside
toward the horizons,
the valleys and the hills
stretched crude and motionless
beneath a small, gray sun
silent as a stone bell.

Since the first announcement
they had been wandering
in these dim processions
across the vacant land:
there was nowhere to halt,
only the way ahead.

If they come at evening
out of the broken light,
or else before the dawn
when dew chills the dead earth,
they will ask a question
we answered long ago.
Into your mouth my name
my head, my arms and all
my body following,
sinking into the night
that spreads its growing tide
over all the beaches.

Currents and dark channels
wandering like old roads
across a vague country;
silence, indifference,
a prison without walls
or other prisoners.

Naked I carue, unarmed,
into your emptiness,
and stubbornly went on,
until my name, my thoughts,
and my swimming body
were all dissolved in you.
There was a feeling, I know,
as if you had bought some fruit
and put it on the table
where we could watch it ripen:
apples, pears, and oranges,
figs and a few bananas
the hearts of sweetness, and flies.

Suppose I had not come home,
suppose you'd forgotten me,
or grown tired of this page
as the light began to fade?
I see you closing windows,
or pausing at the mirror
I see you touching your lips.

It is here, you whispered, here
and nowhere else that it was;
like the music of traffic
in our terrible city
it must be known to be heard
and yet nothing is harder
than to listen to one's self.

There is the wine in the glass,
and the long evening drinks it;
there were words we waited for,
and they changed us like our lives;
but the night needs only night
so that, being what we are,
we turn to our beginnings.
Of all the sisters he had
not one was fertile, not one.
They crowded about his days
imploring him for a word,
a touch, to keep them alive.
When he shut his mind up tight
they cursed him, and his children.

The woman was as swollen
with what I was to become
as a victim nine days drowned.
Yet it was not natural,
not pleasing, to discover
that the bottom of the sea
was the place where I must live.

After those ten million years
and a world of continents,
I was just as they had been,
like a fossil snail in coal:
the lines of a simple life
that had been lived without thought
yet would last longer than death.

Our wide August raft floated
down that long, slow Sunday path
among old ones and children,
and youths naked in their clothes.
Then you spoke one word, my name.
The leaves turned brown. It was winter.
It was now. I was alone.

You had expected kindness
from my memories, at least.
When you visited that park
in which you had found your love,
addicts of hunger and sadness
were drifting through the dim woods
like poor, lost, mangy mongrels.
But still, it was not something
dropped in one of those dark times,
like our old family ring
that had seemed precious as life
and which you lost yesterday
it was still here, in ourselves,
and younger than our children.

So there was nothing left
of all we had been given;
and yet you woke today,
you sat up after a night
of tears of deathly struggle
against them and their angers,
and smiled at the new sunlight.
I thought I knew that language,
but could not read the pages
that glimmered before my eyes.
I was not drunk, not dreaming.
I was dazzled by these tears,
living tears wept long ago
and by other eyes than mine.

It seemed as though you knew me.
I was a street near your home.
Spring had come. You wore new shoes.
A ball bounced out from the curb
but you were scared by the cars.
Then summer, then winter came.
When spring returned, we had changed.

I had not slept or suffered;
yet, as the ear elimbed the hill
and you looked away, I knew
long before we'd reached the top,
where we would halt, confounded
by that calm, shoreless desert
that my mind had eracked like glass.

Her father owed her too much:
the kiss he never gave her
was bestowed by his brother,
in the fields, against her wish.
Twenty years it haunted her
she did not know what she wad
until they died, and told her.

I lay on my bed, waiting.
I had taken twenty years
from my life and made them one.
There was no more left for me.
Nothing could bring back my life.
No one but I knew the truth.
Soon it would come and kill me.

When I think of you, you come
ten thousand miles are nothing.
Like the memory of love
your kind and naked body
stands here in silence, opened
to the dark jazz of this death.
If I knew your name, I'd speak.

Inside the stones there are birds,
and inside the birds, rivers;
in those rivers, little fish
and in those fish, the stars shine.
The stars were nothing but light.
Then they were dust. Then they fell.
How long ago that all was.
Now, when they are old and sick,
they say they have lied to us,
that we must learn the real use
of the only tools we have:
fingers and feet, and these jaws,
though later on sticks and stones
may prove to be good weapons.

Looking at you this morning
as you stared into the fumes
of your black and bitter cup,
I saw how far we had come:
between us there was nothing
but the past that we'd forgot,
that lay waiting for us now.

If I were the messenger
bringing fresh air from Delphi
like news of April flowers
after a lifetime of winters
anemones and daisies,
such azures, scarlets and white
among those formless ruins...

When they left us behind here
they took just their lives with them,
which were all they could carry,
and but all that we wanted...
I meet them though, now and then,
in my dreamsthese frightful dreams!
happy, doing what they like.

In the middle of the night
windows split, shattered and fell
as though invisible fists
went rapping them at random;
outside in that storm of glass
thc streets were filled with black men,
mute, and patient, and unmoved.

Towards morning, blood rising
in the unlit antique squares
where those white fountains yet splashed
their pure and selfless music,
a dead stillness woke us up:
perhaps an hour remained,
perhaps not. We would make love.

If you walked out now, at noon,
to look across the desert
where colored broken mountains
crumble into boiling sands,
you would see that we're falling,
falling, falling at the sun,
and you would never come home.
I remember a city
maddened by its own people,
black, loud, shaken by machines,
where light burned the open eye
and air filled the lungs with pain;
there, whatever was, was right,
and no one looked at the sky.

And I remember those roads,
swift and merciless as lust,
that coiled about our city
like a living, shrinking mesh:
they were their own laws, the roads,
and their desires were obeyed,
gladly, as if we loved them.

And I remember silence,
as though everyone stopped
at midday just where he stood;
there were no clouds above us,
but high, high, blown by great winds,
silver speeks sparkling
like motes in our swollen eyes.

And I remember thinking,
slowly, with dead clarity,
how I hated old people
for their money and their lies,
and pitied these clever youths
who swallowed all or nothing
that I wished my friends near me.

Silent, we searched across time
through telescopes, wondering:
What books had he saved to read?
How would she have her baby?
Would it rain for you that year?
Had those natives slaughtered them?
I must invent a science.

Halfalive, this drifting world
exposed to the last forces
and far from the granite caves
in which are heaped years on years
the bones of our lost parents:
here men lay dreaming of women,
and the women dreamed of men.

And then the attack came down,
logically, by itself,
as it once did in that tale
when the waters rose and struck
and we found out we had lived
on a vanishing island ...
Smiling, they said, "Now begin."
That first time you were naked
I cherished my dreams of you:
there was no one there at all.
The next you were in the flesh,
waiting to be found, like love.
The last time, you almost spoke.
I remember your long arms.

His anger moved in her mouth
like a prisoner's prayer:
the happiness they wanted
belonged to other people
who are cleverer than they
and live next door like neighbors,
yet much too far for comfort.

Ten years that struggle went on,
as if with these two bare hands
I took by the throat my mind
and fought it down in the dark,
panting, sweating, murmuring
like naked famished lovers
who would die if torn apart.

I was to call him master
though he was my hundredth man.
Pale, thin, cruel, wet, nervousmaster!
And I to be his creature,
even my mind, like these breasts.
But what did he make of me?
Less than others hadand would.

Because I knew you loved me
I was no longer ashamed,
neither of my helplessness
nor of what I'd done to you:
it was your face I kneeled on,
it was your face that I crushed
six days, six nights, in that train.

Hair will grow into their eyes,
and sand will fill their nostrils;
their fingers will fuse like wood
and their feet freeze to black stones;
but they will be wide awake,
they will listen, they will think,
and they will want to make love.

Suddenly our road ended,
nowhere, in a waste of sage
the last lights of America
had disappeared in the dark
a hundred miles behind us,
and out there, blocking the stars,
loomed vast old forms, the mountains.
How long had we been living
there in those slums of summer,
there in that dank, cursed ghetto
where flies fought over bad fruit
and the smoke of people's eyes
hung along the seething streets
through which we found no passage?

Nothing rare or good remained,
everything was secondhand,
used and reused like old books
whose words are strange or stupid:
although it was Octobcr
and they seemcd sick of their past,
they would never let it go.

In our poor, bare, dusty room
we gnawed at one another,
rolling on the Boor like dogs;
our windows, jammed half open,
passed their angry shadows through
and filth that their hands flung up
fell in onuswhere we lay.

It was like a dream, we said,
and we were still like children;
there was no way out, we said,
or if there was, they knew us
by our walk, our low voices:
we were friendless, we were thieves,
and they hated us at sight.

When the rains began to fall
and the wind closed their shutters,
it was time for us to leave:
now that winter was coming
only the stones stayed behind,
the cold, black and ancient stones
glinting with indifference.
My turn will come, you said,
and I shall wake you up
one summer afternoon
like rain in the window
you neglected to close,
and you will curse yourself.

Because your hand will hold
nothing but your own flesh,
dry as your opened mouth;
you will think of my name,
you will want to call me,
but your tongue will not move.

And in the other room
the radio's playing
that bad music it blares
as though I were with you,
or you yourself were there
yet you will be alone.

You will watch the warm rain
falling beyond the trees
on an empty meadow;
not a bird will fly past,
not a car will drive by,
and the day will not end.

It may be your own past,
an hour of memory
that has returned to you
or which you have become,
a time that may have been
part of you, or may not.

How you will want me then!
More than you want to live:
and you will discover
that every bit of me,
all that you thought you had,
is more than ever real.
I closed my eyes and walked
about the house where I
had lived for years, and sulked,
and ate my tongue, and cried.

I groped the hall for you,
my chair, the couch, our bed;
when I touched the window
how chilled I felt, afraid.

A dark mirror, so dark
to my ten famished fingers,
which closed, and would not work,
but gripped these angers.

Inside my mind your voice
sounded vague, vague to me;
old thoughts, old hopes, the curse
of love that's gone away.

"The best of our story
was that we'd never find
ourselves hurt, or sorry
though broken by the wind."

"Shall we not meet again,
speak of our missing life,
asking when this began,
this death, this unbelief?"

How long you had waited,
I said to the dumb walls,
to see me so treated,
a prisoner, and fool!
A half a glass of beer,
a plate of fish and chips,
a long cold foggy day:
out there on the water
slip slap slop like always
with a few gulls asleep.

They think it's monotonous,
they think it's just a fad
you will grow out of yet
like you quit hide and seek,
driving the car too fast,
or touching every blouse.

But it's not that, not that;
there's a basic rhythm
that goes on forever,
and you sit out there and wait
and watch the steady swell
and take the one that counts.

Sometimes nothing happens.
Mostly nothing happens.
They break, you break, or both.
The day passes, a day
like all the other days:
the tide drops and you quit.

But sometimes there's a wave,
that certain lift you feel,
a shadow in the green,
and you know it's the one
and you're with it coming
you're on, you're up, you're in.

There's never someone else.
There's only you alone.
If it's right and you're right,
you're walking on water,
coming in from the sea
as if you were just born
though you never reach shore.
  They wanted our house,
  our clothes, our money,
  they seized everything,
  everything we had
  then they took our skins.

  All that year we walked
  towards the border,
  followed by their eyes,
  as if they pitied
  or could understand.

  In time, somewhere else,
  we grew whole again
  and our lips made sounds
  which, if not human,
  are the words we have.

  They cannot find us
  or destroy us now,
  they have forgotten
  that we ever lived
  Here we wait for them.
For eyes I gave you rubies
twin emeralds for nostrils
I set your mouth with sapphires
and filled your ears with pearls
all the rest I made of gold
so that though my gifts were praised
when they brought you back to love
their hands should never stain you.

And then I forgot your name,
forgot where I laid you down
as the bells began to ring
it was just noon I think
our rotten priests were preaching:
We must fight! and We must pray!
but no one would, no one could,
and their troops went marching by.

We were given up as lost.
Long years, bad years fell on us:
coarse weeds grew in our dry laps
goats and sheep flocked against us
their foul swine rooted in us
mongrels came to scratch and shit
yet we refused to stand up.
That brook saved us from the death.

After so many mornings
a last morning came to us:
the sun broke through our hard sleep
and tore away these covers.
Yet, despite your nakedness,
I could not apprehend you.
Later, in that library,
dim, cold people seized my arms.

And afterwards we wandered
with the roads, everywhere;
sleety clouds pressed on the hills
and closed against the city,
streets and houses turned to stone
and the people spat with hate
because we passed their doors by...
yet we'd been there, long ago.

And so it went, on and on,
through all those days of our lives
and in the dreams of our nights:
there was nothing we could make,
there was nothing we could do
but wait, and wish for an end.
When it came, we were surprised
to find ourselves waiting still.

Now I recall your story
as though it had been mine,
as though I woke at midnight
and lay for hours appalled
by its incessant vision
like those alien paintings
in the old museums groups
of tired tourists must endure.

Let me touch you now, hold you
let me find you warm and soft
let me take away the things
that are neither you nor yours
let me speak to you once more
looking into your kind eyes
as if you would come to me
as if we lived here again.
I had lost my cleverness
and my humor, I had lost
my strength, my love and my hate:
I could not find the true word
which I must say to find you
and yet you were beside me,
to the left and just behind.

I changed again and again
but always seemed just the same;
I killed and cursed, wept and fought
my way to an unknown house
where I stopped, baffled, and heard
a greeting so familiar
that I knew it must be you.

And here was my professor
seated at his writing desk
in his starched white doctor suit;
the Midwest air, hot and wet,
filled his booklined room with death,
and as he smiled, smiled at me,
I saw he was drunk, and mad.

He knew a secret doctrine
by which bourbon would unlock
the history of my face,
the mystery of my race,
if I'd wait with him for dawn:
when I stooped to shake him
he spoke his prayersin Greek.

There was nothing more to do.
As I turned from him, he cried
"Watch me, and I'll show the way!"
He wore a long golden robe
and a shining golden crown:
as my torchlight struck his face
he leaped laughing from the room.

Our car crashed in a plowed field
and burnt itself to nothing;
we walked on across country
stumbling through the morning mist:
cows danced by with full udders,
and a stallion galloped mares
round us in thundering rings.

Pigeons sprang up at our feet,
and long files of geese flew past
on our right, to the Northwest,
the way that we were going:
and when we found the great trees
shading the slowing river
we took off our clothes, and slept.
I had known who you were
long before I woke up
and found you beside me,
before I turned the car,
left, down an unknown street
full of such poor people
who stared as we drove through.

At the end, at the wharf,
the ship was waiting still,
the great old famous Queen
with the thousand cabins
and the holds vast enough
for all that was needed
on the long excursion.

My mind was not made up.
And I had no money.
What had I left undone?
Yet I could not return.
But where were they going?
It had not been announced.
And I had not been asked.

While the gulls screamed and swooped
we crept on board her then
over an unwatched plank.
Behind us the city
that had been deserted
so many years ago
spread silent, empty, dead.

Lines on the Neck of a Crude Amphora Which I Dug Up in a Field in Sicily
Under the Stars
I've come for your eyes you said
the door shaking between us
my dumb knees braced against you
my shoulder jammed deaf in you
hard I feel you breathing hard
hoarse sighs words clogging my skull
these words choking me stale sounds

you know who it is you said
the lock rattling between us
my heart whines at my ribs
I hear you singing you said
your scorn hissing sharp as hail
ripping my scalp like salt claws
my lips crushed glass dry grinding

ask me what I want you said
these hasps squealing between us
my neck stiffens in its sheath
as I take your blank force heaved
a wave bulging the wall in
my tongue groans at my cracked teeth
rust flakes my throat bloody scales

have you had enough you said
the wood splitting between us
alone in my skin I sweat
under your hard flashing pulse
my flesh turning and turning
its fat seething like kisses
my lungs burnt open crumbling

let's get it over you said
the door broken between us
my coiled muscles burst apart
my guts spill out at my feet
my bones shatter in crystals
and blow away like blind dust
even before you touch me

you thought you loved me you said
I'm here now take me you said
I will give you what you want
you said nothing more than this
you said your voice flooding me
with your hot blasting silence
why dont you answer you said
It was that red moon rising
through our bitter city's fumes,
and the fires under our streets
that seethed pounding steel and stone
into a slow oily dust
on which we lived, like crystals
Condemned to breathe, I cried out

And that bright planet rising,
there, beyond our haggard roofs,
that distant evening friend
who follows like a good bitch
and keeps her clear eye on us,
wary of our promises
Condemned to touch, I took you

And later, that pale river
of cold light across the sky,
too far to carry us now --
what did we say it must be?
dead clouds, or a mist of souls
blown off by the polar winds...
Condemned to eat, I ate you

It was then our count began,
and we measured all our stars
and knew each one by its name,
marking its history down
from white light to russet flames,
and our night shrank, our night grew
Condemned to hear, I killed you

What was left? the world prostrate,
and in this furnace these bones,
glowing on their mound of ash,
all that remained of the past,
hissing, snapping like green wood,
charring our eyes, and the moon
Condemned to see, I sought you

Do you recall those hard roads,
frozen, gray as the small moon
hanging over these blank hills
where we wandered, drifting west
with those others, armed shadows,
men and women and their dogs?
Condemned to move, I came here
As our earth and sky went black
I stopped and stood, I waited,
without moon or stars or time --
no, you were not among them,
you were nothing anymore --
and our long night almost gone
and I was awake at last
Condemned to live, I speak now
but this is where I came in
I said floating fast asleep
my fists clenched my feet kicking
my eyes shut to the salt deeps
my tail thrashing at black ooze
here the currents carried me
as though these waters were mine

and here is another door
I said when the surf opened
and I crawled out dreaming still
on the bleached and broken shore
my bones swelled in my soft skin
my snout lifted from the sand
as though these sharp rocks were mine

but there must be a way there
I said beyond this cave's mouth
and I strode out in the snow
my arms before me weapons
my eyes fixed on the high pass
where the winds whirled the light round
as though this world were mine

and the last door is that flame
I said that flame flowing down
like the sun falling like air
falling earth water falling
and I ran on into fire
my thought burning through my sleep
as though its ash would be mine

but here is another door
I said walking into you
mother your breast waiting wide
father a child in your lap
myself a child too once more
my dish my spoon before me
as though this were our morning

and I woke inside my sleep
I said as the door swung out
poor streets poor walls poor windows
the staring blanks of slummed faces
mouths fading behind blurred hands
ruins like women begging
as though their love had been mine

but this world is hard I said
break it take the seeds of life
plant them in my heart I said
water them and submit me
to your heat I said your sun
till I wake inside my life
I said as though it were mine
your hands wrung these words from me
shook me dry as this old book
that has laughed its last and wept
and withers here in the dust
mouse-stained mildewed forgotten
in the lobe of my left lung
where it waits for me like death

like a man born just today
out of his own life saying
but does my mother know me
she knows me she knows me not
and does my father know me
he knows me he knows me not
till the answer comes like death

like my family my friends
who gather at this table
in the wilderness my home
amongst these sweating machines
and show me their broken cups
their empty plates their hunger
surrounding my heart like death

like faces condemned to live
on the anger of cold stairs
trudging out their conviction
from nowhere back to nowhere
just as I climbed on your words
from the child's grave in my arms
to this sentence served like death

like my one love my lady
lying in her narrow bed
her thoughts bitter as her breasts
her hair clotted in her groin
my tongue stumbling on her teeth
our groans of futile passion
flesh beating at flesh like death

like prayer this offering
made from fossil scraps strange signs
phrases buried by prophets
beneath our floor of charred stone
the smashed skulls of temple feasts
remnants of some other life
hidden inside us like death

without words I know your words
promising me your silence
when I can stand in the sea
and feed the hands that feed me
when I can find my own face
and know what I know no more
you will speak to me like death
this is the way waking is
you were here just as I am
whispering to me your breathing
wakes me now you can hear me
look at me lying naked
as the sun in your mirror
and blank as your eyes and mine
like water trembling naked
at the edge of this calmed shore
where you watched for evening
and listened to these shadows
our words floating suspended
on the surface of our lives
between your day and my nights

stones my animal hands dropped
shells scraped thin scarred by my claws
bones pounded open sucked dry
strewn like words through your strata
darkness hidden in darkness
where you vanished with my name
my animal name in your mouth

my faithful animal legs
still prowling your lost forest
will pause where paths met and passed
silent paths that led to time
once a great tree living here
rooted in my heart in rock
bare now cracking in the sun

no passage for light in me
yet my patience grows like sand
my animal feet sinking
in shattered crystals of sand
dunes of bright sand wandering
where my desert drifts silent
and its stars have no stories

behind me beyond those hills
a stubble of stumps rotting
where the stream winds itself down
cold and clear rattling pebbles
in this head like my hard thoughts
of nothing but nothing but
your water your pouring light

until I know you are here
and my animal heart laughs
lungs cry belly bleeds and face
my animal face breaks off
leaving me alone my life
tied now head to toe to you
my life my animal death
    Asleep, curled in your pocket,
    he waits, his wings quivering,
    and with his two old friends dreams
    of those moist, those blue mornings
    before these shrinking, white days
    that crack our chilled hearts like glass
    came to tell us of winter

    Do you remember those breasts?
    How straight she walked, eyes opened,
    her long arms held out, her hands
    strong and tapered, cupped flowers,
    offering you her friendship,
    like the touch of love's kindness
    her smiling lips showed she knew?

    Out of an early hour,
    with a flecking of salt spume
    you could taste on her shoulders
    and her hair heavy with youth,
    faint stars caught in its coiled ropes,
    she had come to greet you, yes,
    so that you would see, and know

    And you woke, as though the sun
    were waking too, round and warm,
    and growing from her belly
    as she stood there in silence,
    waiting till you rose, and stood,
    till you let your locked thoughts go
    and welcomed her against you

Again! Again and again!
Dont you remember her breasts?
that bright sky that shone on you
as the garden turned drifting
amongst those mountain orchards
and the sun pressed sweating down
on their swollen, dripping fruit?

And then she laughed, how she laughed!
her smooth limbs flung blazing wide
then wound round you tightening
as you thrashed in terror, trapped-
all that day long you struggled,
a beast, child, man-a young god
crying and singing and wild

as the hot red dusk crumbled
and fell in ashes on you
where you sprawled between wrecked walls
your bones burning themselves out
your mind staring at that sky,
cold, blind, black and high, so high...
Dont you remember her, now?
I brought you these broken words
a basket of oranges
fingers, toes, liver and lungs
gave what I thought you wanted
what I could no longer use,
here, on this side of my life --
and you threw them in the trash

Eyes, you said, your tongue and heart
your belly and guts and balls,
not that empty, polished head!
Now carry them here, spread them out,
salt them, soak them, wash them off,
put them to simmer in me
with herbs and wine, for tonight
I carried your breasts for you
I followed your long thin legs
across the sand to the edge
of the world where the stones die
I took your rings from your hands
your clothes from your warm body --
and sat here, waiting for you

Merciless words you whispered,
your hands stroking my furred face,
until my mind was flooded
with space flowing like blind winds
pressing forcing me open
to your blank stars, till I knew
that love, too, must be endured

On the other side of fear
you waited for me to come,
my breasts swinging freely now,
leading me to you at last
through these rough waves of cold light,
to lay my life down on yours,
where yours lies, a dead altar

You carried me to the end,
my blood running iron flames
from every fault in my flesh
You lifted me, drank me dry
and shattered me on your stones
My love, you said, my poor love,
will you ever understand?

Now the mountains are naked
the rivers tighten their nets
the grasses grow like fevers
the sea fills with living ice
We have given these bodies --
I to you, love, you to me --
and taken them home again
All that day they strolled past me
flexing their innocent thighs
their song pitiless, secret
humming strange words I still hear
like souls saved, soft and glowing
I could never find myself
while I waited for their eyes

At the bottom of my stairs
I waited always a child
crouching at home in this street
shivering, my few words fouled
my wrists bitten white with fear
hiding your love up my sleeve
where it sucked my hot eyes dry

When I touched your opened lips
when I licked your turning tongue
the walls cracked, the wind whistled
roads rose and fell in my brain
birds above those roads flying
your words waiting for my mouth
echoes trapped in these mountains

Feet tied with your running hair
fingers crushed by your shoulders
ears drowned in your flooding breasts
my throat pressed between your hands
hands heavy with long waiting
that tear me out of my face
before I find your secret

Ask me, you said, what you want
lift the stone of my lost head
that black rough turning stone world
harsh and buried in your lap
dense as a dead star and packed
with ancient thoughts, thoughts waiting
and mute till the end, like you

Bodies, sealed bodies waiting
face to face, or back to back
back to back, or head and toe
head and toe, or side by side
latticed, laced and sliding
like plasma into my heart
swollen with time, radiant

Year by year I climb, ravaged
up my stairs again with you
in my hands torn and savage
your words waiting, whispering
beating like my life on yours
and yours on mine, like the waves
that burst from your ravaged eyes
running nowhere on these sands
following my shifting shore
as the sun swells with your light
above that seething steelblue waste
blank from my groin to these eyes
pursuing my own footprints
my ears stuffed with my own noise

down that dust comes windblown coarse
splintering my metalled flesh
blasting me dry as these hills
that rise shaking our world
day and night mountains trembling
between your patient breakers
and our flattened human lands

like weed your light grows on me
though washed ashore you held me
where I lay slashed by hooked beaks
your seagulls scavenging me
till my emptied shell shone, pearls
these pale rainbows locked in me
your light ground out by my life

in me no light grows but this dark
because I would not sit down
with my own life like a man
nor stand still one hour to watch
your hair glowing in vines of light
out of your eyes, your belly
your legs your buttocks your back

nor kneel at your red fountain
where the lava boils in you
your armpits bubbling like lead
your throat burning, saying yes
o yes love, you are coming
on my streaming paths coming
pressed to my broken walls, love

where you clutch at me bleeding
your knees shattered like ruined shells
throw me your torn scalp, you say
bury your fingers in me
unravel your shirt of nerves
like glass threads and twist yourself
round my wrists, come, love, you say

I have you now, love, you say
your guts writhing on my coals
stomach liver kidneys spleen
your bloated lungs and bladder
thrown to your own starved shadows
love, I wear you now, you say
like stains on my clear body

When my wife wrote this poem
in my dream last night I laughed:
she knew all the ways to say
hustle: hustle and hustle
and hustle... I woke, hustling-
there we lay, third stage burned out,
orbiting and forgotten
Four times I crossed this damned town
north south east west drove all day
just burning up the freeways
as long as my gas lasted
and I was still a free man
with my wheel in these two hands-
but I never saw you there
She lies alone in her bed
cold hands pressed between cold thighs
her skull swollen and empty
as her eyes, her lips, her breasts-
he will come, carry her down,
pour her out of her lost life,
and burn his dead fears away
We were numbered, each of us
a number but those numbers
burned into us through our skin
a reference in the files. .
oh quick, quick, find us find us
before these ashes crumble,
whirling numbers on the wind
For homes they levelled these hills
surrounded you with their guns
while we sat and drank our beer
watching his dogs tear at her
because she's cunt she's proud she
says if it's good then take it
but I think I'll burn it down
the map showed no signs of us
when you held it to the light
no wrecks rusting in your veins
no white rows of broken teeth
or flesh torn, flapping like tents
burnt through by forgotten wars-
yet it's there we'll die, again
I had made my life my god,
who cursed me with my own words,
these cold letters burning you,
everywhere, like a blessing:
so that my death brings you life
and you think that you are free...
like the stones that walk this world

what am I who else but me
monkey twitching monkey hair
lipping my toes ca ca ca
in my tunnel in my trees
blessed by bees my me my me
sleeping with my family
like me like me ca ca ca

you yes you you know it's you
no one else where you are you
squatting at the wall the flies
the sun the stone merciless
cities driven from each door
your father's face in your hands
your mother's voice in your cries

him oh him he feels himself
climbing in his contraption
his praying machine now up
now down his darkness carries
him his words whirling him now
light lighter than light and how
he stands himself on himself

from space she falls from nowhere
her dreams sheathe her skin like gold
her eyes cut blanks in the void
and she floats through time shining
as though flying to herself
that strange warm body down there
turning dark like this planet

coiled inside itself hiding
itself resonant with lust
to be itself to be all
in these hot cells its gardens
invisible acids molds
dust quivering and common
living on death's vacant winds

what do you think of our place
we built it for ourselves look
the walls thighs roof backs floor breasts
patched males females hands knees good
filled with sand our old home look
when we come here we will stay
tonight our tribe is starving

this morning they knew it all
each one came to his own stone
each stone touching every stone
face to face harder than hate
one long slow joy without light
until their eyes were ground out
their thoughts crushed fused lost like love

they have reached these vague borders
occupied passes swamps plains
patrol these hot forest trails
they regroup rearm confer
they command the air above
they are ready to invade
they think the dead defenceless

years we marched from day to day
we ate root stem leaf flower
and fruit we tore flesh sucked bones
laughing together dancing
weeping like children we killed
and burned our own fat for light
never thinking they would come
first it must be found once more
although it was never lost
it waits somewhere like a thought
the thought is shaped like a key
this key fits a certain gate
yet that gate was never locked
because no one built this wall

unseen she turns reflected
in the mirrors locked in her self
all light lost in her black holes
her ears her ass armpits nose
cunt navel womb her blank eyes
her mouth is open singing
fuck it baby ofuck it!

dust swelling hot radiant
bursting he hurtles dispersed
beyond his own space boiling
bulging from his bones like time
fists feet skull knees neck shoulders
his prick his teeth clanging o!
love, mother of the muses!

there you are but coming here
like a steel shadow always
and shaped like your poor body
under living fire shattered fires
you surround your enemy
yourself hunting yourself yes
have you understood have you

I wake now I stand I breathe
I walk I find touch seize you
to me they trooped my armies
my savage children trampling
eating my face drinking blood
storming my blank wall
they find us together now

I lie strewn on these blind sands
that shift in the August breeze
and blow back on winter gales
etching my bones grain by grain
with faint words I speak now
as I slide from these seasons
a man falling from the sun

what sifts through my bleached skull
agate chips shells emptied claws
frayed bits of broken silence
floating up to the world's skin
as I sink in this long fall
through the staring darkness
through time through these dry sands drowned

and dropping slowly drifting
past the frenzied spinning worlds
past stars that blossom and burst
raining shattered light as dust
that sweeps over the last shores
in dead foam of bitter pearl
blasting the void where I fall

straight through this stilled universe
crushing our stone to nothing
like a thin floor of hard space
and far how far below there
a lake of black waters wide
cold waters held deep held pure
in the open hands of death

towards which I am falling
my life burning out my bones
cell by stubborn cell crumbling
dissolving my selves at last
waste shadows traced through this night
lost between being and not
annihilated and gone

plunged at the end and falling
still falling towards that lake
those ancient heavy waters
no hands can touch no mouth drink
waters waiting under the sands
for all that falls from above
and falls thinking to the end

to enter the quiet pool
stripped of hope fear stripped away
and every fearful turning
of that rope of twisted words
that tied me to my own thoughts
naked of words now and thoughts
I slip blank beneath its waves

my cold fingers touched your toes
as I climbed from that lost well
and traced your pale steel veins around
where your heels joined the dead rock
I clambered up your ankles
scaled your shins gripping your calves
with my torn and sweating life

and clung to your knees a ledge
where men have perished before
iced gusts swinging their frayed hopes
against the stone of your legs
as they climbed those swelling thighs
through white mists that hid the way
beyond the trees of their world

towards you where you must be
where I must crawl up the night
mounting you by thrust and haul
between these blank slipping walls
vanishing above hidden
from the man climbing to you
hand over hand for his life

out of that dry sunless pit
where my infant bones were thrown
in the beginning broken
on the broken moons down there
a sacrifice to our lives
dying like our savage friends
while I climb in your groined depth

to pitch my body at you
turning and walled in you now
warmed by that bloody darkness
walking that narrow way at last
as though welcomed as though saved
restored to speech by your words
so that I may climb again

from that gemmed cleft towards you
roaming your forest a beast
among your beasts forty years
like forty days forty years
hunting the light of your steppes
where I may think like a man
as far as a man can see

till my mind looks up once more
groping for your breasts for love
looming at the world's end love
waiting in another air
another world where your heart
opens beating like the sky
and I climb towards you again

your hand touches your breast here
where I lie fading a bruise
like my words my lips my tongue
holding your hurt heart my mouth
gripping at you still attached
as though my teeth were fingers
tracing a path through your veins

towards you as you drive west
into that gentle valley
up a vague road winding slow
among the rolling pastures
as old as America
yet virgin still and waiting
for you to carry love here

like the pain your hand touches
silent as I am silent
when you stop by the white house
standing awash in dead leaves
fallen over these years leaves
I remember them brown years
I had seen coming for us

whispering my words to you
again beneath your hand words
pressing hard against your breast
as though I stood beside you
opening the door wide now
for you to enter autumn
through this evening darkness

lighting the fire pouring wine
setting out apples and bread
as the year closes our time
where you sit with me and drink
hearing the wind in your oaks
tear at these words I write words
winter flings against your hills

while flame wraps your night once more
our cries flaring like embers
before the chill rains sweep down
flooding your gardens and field
burdening your path with ice
blocking your way towards dawn
the world's light fogged and dimmed cold

and gray as these morning hours
crumbling into words like ash
where you wait for love alone
for the sun to break through here
under your hand at your breast
to warm what remains of me
stone that cannot speak again

she squats over her burnt years
scorching her slimed monkey's cunt
filling that bronzed bag her flesh
with fat from my bitter thoughts
so that she swells she trembles
she coils her creamy muscles
her eyes pleasured and molten

oozing sighs like salt etching
these phrases in my clawed cheeks
and grins as she scrapes my wounds
and whines as she kneels at me
her tits fuming naked frost
her ass spreading over me
wide as this hard arctic night

sinking its locked weight on me
grinding my arms down my legs
pressing me doomed in her dream
beneath her swollen body
biting pitiless as ice
shattering me with her tongue
until my silence bleeds stones

and there is nothing but stone
sliding into her numbed head
though she is thinking my name
which is her cry her language
and singing my name gig gig
which she stuffs in her dry mouth
and cursing my name gog gog

like my life caught in her throat
choking us both gag gag gag
what does she want from me now
screaming out of that dropped paunch
because she lost her bright eyes
dancing around my clay legs
taking my thoughts from my teeth

for I am her god her thing
she shakes me when I stand stiff
holds me to her ear and waits
for me to speak strange sounds words
rattle rattle speak new words
her lips whistling whispering
wanting words she takes from me

and wraps about her shoulders
where she squats by the glass wall
hairless whimpering to me
that she has not taken all
piddling on these sucked out bones
and craving craving my sweet words
devoured in her wintry lair

now his hands are at my life
tearing these pearls from my throat
my gold bands from my locked wrists
my warm robe from my shoulders
his hands strip my sleep from me
as I watch his face his eyes
watching me in my mirror

where I see myself waking
standing in this room alone
an empty lunar crater
flooding now about my thighs
with time's lightfilled urgent dust
rising like his words pressing
and soundless as love forcing

me on its forgotten way
to this meeting in me where
I have never come before
where I cannot come again
until his living fingers
bless my silent lips these stones
sealed like my body silent

opening my dreaming eyes
at last to my secret death
among these broken passions
these enemies and lovers
starving friends who bind my arms
leading me always astray
from the memory of life

when I want to drink my life
from this cup my poor fathers
gave me the cup their fathers
carried from Jerusalem
the cup he places in my hands
filling it with blood pouring
my life for me to drink now

until I come to myself
and stand like his shadowed self
here in my wide empty eyes
before me in my mirror
calling him to me from darkness
discarding this long silence
and giving myself to him

as though he will gather me
together in his hands
and restore my scattered years
in that hour brief as love
before I fall from that joy
down to my darkening sleep
where I wait for him once more

she opens the book and reads
black letters blank words phrases
like these written in my head
by a hand rough with bear's blood
sentences stitched together
pelt by pelt and worn
a lifetime by a strange beast

where she sits there is no dark
the winds tear round in my head
keeping the carcasses cold
the fire smokes the walls glisten
with wan light a winter's life
flickering in its stone cup
shaping these words from shadows

until they fill her cold lap
with blood that streams down her legs
to the ground my father's ground
packed with thinking bones with words
like these words wrapped in ashes
formed by the forms forming her
from the words on this dark page

as I was from the stone roof
that glittered with insect stars
in that staring woman's eyes
where she lay by the low flame
summoning me in my flesh
and thrusting me at your world
to be destroyed with the rest

leaving what is left for you
where men fall fighting these streets
with hands stripped naked as girls
women roaming wild like cows
gaunt boys clutching at their breasts
children heaped in your doorways
spilled like plastic bags of trash

can she hear me speaking now
I am walking back and forth
through her eyes in a circle
tirelessly from line to line
my words making her lips move
as though she saw herself stand
raising her arms towards me

and calling my name the name
she knows I have forgotten
the name written in her book
in lines cut in her body
wound on her long arms like snakes
waters clouds rivers of rain
masked by this script like my name

I am here for you hiding
scattered like hydrogen's dust
inside you thinking of me
inside me inside these words
spreading deep cold hope darker
than love can follow or find
hunting the blank fields of time
inside you thinking of me
these heavy grains condensing
inside me inside these words
warming the simple matter formed
glowing in our silent thoughts
a blue world like light growing
in our arms burning us white
inside you thinking of me
inside me inside these words
cast with the elements to drift
whirled through our red giant's heart
and thrown into time like hope
everywhere hiding and lost
beyond the last reach of love

inside you thinking of me
inside me inside these words
our world wasting now a shell
cracking our life time shrinking
and space crumbling in on us
where love lies hiding from love
sustained by hope no longer

inside you thinking of me
inside these words
flaring brighter than before
from passion's ruins reborn
out of the silence to burst
like blind particles fierce hopes
bodies through bodies streaming

inside you thinking of me
inside me inside these words
spinning from the hidden heart
these dark messages pulsing
from the shrivelled source flashing
like blank fertile matter speaking
our death to the living stars

until love's last radiance
contracts on its own core
heavier than all time lost
hidden from the universe
sealed in its sphere invisible
inside you thinking of me
inside me inside these words

We walked along these high walls,
which have no gates, no windows,
which stand scarred, burnt by old wars
and barbarous, mere neglect.

When we asked what lay inside,
they said, Your lost paradise,
your holy city of love,
which will never let you in,
though you may march forty years
round and round, blowing horns
and battering at its stone.

A foolish story! you said.
A story for fools, I said.

Day after day, we kept on:
this must be China, we said,
ruined both sides of the wall.

So we searched for our lost selves
here in our human desert
where all must live, and all dies,
even those old Emperors
who made this forbidden wall
that keeps us from the city,
the holy city of love
that will never let us in...
till we stand still, you and I,
in silence, and build our own.

the broken neck of the vanished jar
remembers the oil the water the wine
that poured through its thirsty throat
the body that held it high, so frail,
shattered into its mud again

this thickened throat remains and
    remembers and speaks still
of bodies filled with fresh joys
the water oil wine of ancient ways
hand to hand out of the world
    into the world again
as though this neck held the head
as though that vanished fulfilled body
    restores itself
in time with us again

Their presences draw near
of all that I must fear;
no others seem like those
who come from nowhere close,
from nothingness appear
and stand in silence here
as though they came to me
because they come for me.

My life my flesh my bone
are mine, but not my own;
[who was eloquent,
who am, inconsequent
now as spent violence,
standing in the silence
of a ring of many,
a silent company.

No matter what I do
I do not speak to you
though I am speaking now
how I do not know how
and though it's you I see
you do not speak to me;
of all whom I did fear
your presences are here.

The technique of love
The technique of power
The technique of laughter
In this bottle you see morning
on this shelf is grass
here are specimens of turning,
nights which you must pass

love distilled from antique mirrors
tinCtures made of breath
pills of joy and powdered terrors
things to ease your death

the formulas of secret fears
catalogues of dreams
the bones of hope, the flesh of tears
what is, and what seems

all, all has been found out, tested,
certified as true;
time alone must be invested:
we depend on you.
Where the heart was, a domestic chasm, an abyss bridged by snow
As France, once great, collapsed into tourism and poetry
Behind the sublimity, obscene

Unable to command even the words useful to propose toasts
Having filled space beneath the zodiac with debris
And found the moon in its rounds merely vague

This is the town he has chosen to live out his time in:

A DELUXE BODY & FENDER SHOP
                               BUILDING SUPPLIES
                                     DRUGS
                               FUNERAL SERVICES

                               MEATS & GROCERIES
                 in emergencies call THE OPERATOR (dial zero)

He conforms to everything
He worships pleasantly
He tinkers endlessly with mixed drinks
He reneges on the Revolution, though it tore him from his chains
He tolerates melioratives
He addresses queries to psychiatrists who answer in
     newspaper columns
He deplores the inhumanity of the avant/garde
He praises fools, and suffers them gladly
He preserves himself out of perversity, and perseveres

And in secret, at odd moments, he makes metaphors of royalty
Self piteously beginning Petrarchan sonnets thus:

                             After the Coronation
            Forthright, busy Fortinbras summoned me,
            Courteous, condoled a little, and then,
            Snapping for his secretary, took pen
            And signed me out ofhis drumming country...

Surmising that force brings no apples from the bare branch
Like a dark prophet in a wilderness of bright people
Full of exotic necessities
Or like a rational Messiah
Sojourning with brutes, sweet boys and hairy girls,
He busies himself studying the culture of perfume advertisements
But this year June came on bucolic.
We wore shorts, went tanned and barefoot.
Bright, hot, clear, dry; green, fresh, sweet, thick.
Apple, pear, lilac, rose, chestnut,
dandelions, primrose, peonies...
We breathed, stretched, breathed: ah we were free!

But there were more bugs, and worse too.
Houseflies and bluebottles swarmed and lit;
Adirondack blackflies came through;
venomous deerflies, how they bit;
big, lazy, thirsty mosquitoes
so quiet they could sting your nose!

But we felt, after months of snow
and that total absence of birds,
this June was our reward somehow.
So we got wrens and hummingbirds,
orioles, cardinals, phoebes
on our porch, sills, gutters and eaves.

But now silence, and no children.
Just last week a halfgrown fox, mad,
bit the art collector's widow's man
and slipped back to her dim, dry wood;
slipped out, bit our recluse, Priest,
in his patch at dusk: poor sick beast.

And so a week of rain and cold.
No flowers, no birds except crows,
no dogs barking at this gray world.
Where the vixen went no one knows.
Troopers scour gully and pasture.
We stay in, quite out of nature.
Those mad quarrels went on and on
and then she wept, and scratched your face
because she no longer loved you
because she'd lost her slender waist
lotions, unguents-her skin flaked

Was that sensible: love, love, love?
always hungry, belly and groin?

So you made this garden for her
hacked grass, plowed loam, harrowed, spaded
planted Burbank's Patented Prides
hoed and weeded, mulched, staked and tied

But did she drop her golden brush
did she leave her silver mirror?

So, what's there in the freezer now?
your corn withered on its tall stalks
squash rotted, too big on your vines
tomatoes, stung by frost, blackened...
While she nibbled and smoked and paced
or read her fashion magazines

Yesyes, she jeers, yes but
look what he's done to me!
When he takes me driving
I count telephonepoles
So damned bored so damned bored
I cook exotic meals
O Raphael! O Gabriel!
O Michael! Brandish your swords!
It got colder and colder
Then lights began going on
I whispered, Honey, don't be scared
They'll be undressed too

And so it was...
We had lost that shimmering darkness of our clothes

Right out loud I said
(was I complaining?)
She wore me like a brassiere
She ate me like a diet
She used me to fill her purse
All week I worked in that office
Thinking of ways to redeem her
Cash her in at face value
But never found the right time
Or my suitcase, or the bonds
She was too quick, too stubborn
Look at her-unkillable!
Rapidly she got pregnant
And gave me this litter
(what did I do to deserve it?)
One three/colored, sixtoed calico puss
Two tawny tiger toms, the gray female
And a black yelloweyed runt named for me
That I stepped on by mistake, in the dark
Just like a farce!
At last my heart, though it has no reason,
Gave up such unequal struggle
And delivered me from myself
-- And from you!
A PROBLEM, hypothetical, in the form of a piercing dilemma:
    Surrender may be cheap, but life costs too much.

A SOLUTION, hypothetical, in the form of a cornucopia spilling
      queries like random streams of lethal particles from which there
      is no shelter (except to exist in the saltmines).

AFTER SWITCHING the light out, but before dropping onto
      bed (why not make this your setting/down exercise for
      mind and heart and senses?), stand chilling awhile
      at the window, contemplate the darkness visible of
      that moving universe you are glad to escape once more
      for your personal, uncontrollable slumber, and consider
      what it asks: Why is it there? When will you be
      there? How can you get there? And where (should you
      miraculously be the very one to guess the right answers,
      1,2,3!), and where will you be when you are there?

COULD YOU, perhaps, have been studying the wrong subjects
      all along? And were you, friends, inevitably and
      necessarily misled by malicious gods (or ghosts)?
      Or was it your ancestors' accidentally accumulated
      and capriciously edited tables of law, of latitude,
      logarithm and organization, which both propelled
      and misguided you on this course? In any case, given
      the right chance, if such there be, can the antique
      weapons of the foundering vessel somehow be turned
      against the strangers in our midst, that is, against
      our heirs? Will you try? Would it be any use to
      you to do so?

BUT, MY FRIENDS, after having devoted yourselves with such
      intensity to your lonely regimen of daily jogging and
      pushups, or, alternatively, to mastering the intricate
      systems of progressive jujitsu, which affords security
      against superior antagonists, what can you accomplish
      in the face/to/face, one/to/one contest eternity
      demands?

OR, NOT LOOKING THAT FAR AHEAD, what will account for the
      liveliness of some old men and the stupidity of others?
      Their glands? Is it money, diet, programmed/exercises
      and regular check/ups? Is it meditation, character,
      fate, or a subtle definite proportion of each combined
      in a certain way? Is it maybe climate,
      or even race? Can it depend on the quality of the
      disciples who attend them? Perhaps it is merely an
      illusion fostered by the imbecile selfishness of
      the rest of us, who are all just the same
      quite as human although we never realize it?
      Was there, in other words, a woman to be searched for?
      Or, possibly, which amounts to the same thing in the end,
      a woman to be destroyed?

LOOK, TO PUT IT ANOTHER WAY, Suppose The Revolution is
      coming? If so, from what direction? And who is to
      be executed? And is there never any possibility for
      an honest reprieve? And when The Revolution comes,
      what will it bring to the surface, extended monstrously
      over the undulant dim waters like the Great Pacific
      Squid basking in the starlight, more unreal then than
      the scattered and hearsay reports of its existence?
      Furthermore, which one of you will be imaginative
      enough in his inescapable despair and sufficiently
      brutalized by events to prepare The Counterrevolution,
      and afterward The Countercounterrevolution, and so on?
      And meanwhile strong enough to endure forever the
      plangent echoes of the bursting bombclusters and the
      howitzers firing in rotation, the muted, vibrant,
      thunderous idling of the enormous jets and the regular
      convoys of trucks and tanks, and the printing presses
      day and night pounding and rolling, the staccato of
      loudspeakers shouting over them, amplified unbearably,
      and indeed the peaceful rumbling of the diesels of the
      field/turbines, and of the tractors, the bulldozers,
      the graders and the shovels and cranes and rivetters
      and pavers, and then the busses and typewriters and
      comptometers and computers and cashregisters and
      airconditioners and, mingled with it all, always,
      roocoocooing here and there like courting mourningdoves,
      the machineguns, the machineguns...?
      Is there any substitute for the sound of the human voice?

THEREFORE, NOT TO ANTICIPATE FOR YOU the unknown
      pleasures of white hair in retirement to the paradise of
      patriarchal irresponsibility, let me ask you what is
      bound to occur to you sometime, somewhere: in the
      satiny, stainless/steel, fluorescentlit and automatic
      elevator rising and sinking morning or evening with
      that sickening glide in the sealed shaft, or when,
      after jerking to a stop in the tunnel, the engineless
      commuters' train waits, stale, then jerks creeping
      ahead, or as the car is sidling forward in suffocating
      endless traffic on the hazy parkways, or sometime
      while you are manipulating the dials and punching the
      keys in their marvellous sequences, or while listening
      patiently to the minutes of the previous meeting and
      jotting down notes for the minutes of the present
      meeting which will be read at the next meeting (and
      glancing frequently, furtively, at the selfwinding
      wristwatch), during the sorting and filing of the week's
      correspondence, or at the weighing/in of the luggage
      when en route to conference sessions that will it is hoped
      occasion an even greater flow of correspondence,
      or perhaps with the anxious yet fearfully excited and
      curious intake of breath as you unfold the morning's
      incredible newspaper or later yank hurriedly at the
      recalcitrant cigarette machine in the lobby for the 
      necessary second pack, or even while, in one of those rare
      free hours, dialing the right number (you know this dear 
      number by heart!) but hanging up after the first buzz,
      your palms moist and cold, or, in the dentist's
      waitingroom, staring fascinated at the fullpage
      fourcolor photographs and wondering with envy and
      stultifying dismay just where on earth those models
      were posed with such insouciantly hieratic and
      meaningless attitudes -was it Alexandria, Cuzco,
      Pompeii? under the Sphinx, in Bombay, Rio de Janeiro,
      Teheran, Odessa, St. Peter's Square, at the Lincoln
      Memorial, or Nassau, under St. Paul's dome, in
      Bangkok, Nome, Alaska, on Hawaii's black sand
      beach, Wall Street or San Diego or the Free Market
      of Hongkong, Singapore, Montreal, Copenhagen, the
      Midsummer Fjords, and so forth... places, places, perpetual
      recollections of the geography of advertising! or
      are they actually only facsimiles
      of sunlight faked up against the studio wall with
      artificial architecture and the false luxury of the
      patina of ancient props which makes anything authentic-
      or, some other time altogether, between the locker/
      room and the barbecue pit, maybe while musingly
      shaking the last two spoons of Bromo Seltzer out of
      the famous blueglass bottle, or, late again for the
      party and rummaging for the missing cufflink, or
      while waxing the fishline in the springtime (in autumn
      greasing the heavy boots, also sorting cartridges),
      or, it might well be, slumping dazed in the barber'
      chair without your glasses and unable to see what's
      been done, or mulling the odds changing constantly
      up there on the board as the line moves up too
      easily toward the betting window, or, after the
      last drink, fumbling for the elusive hatcheck, or
      sometime between the fantastic hors d'oeuvres and
      the terrified glances of hostess and host as the
      evening is chewed relentlessly and swallowed down
      in boredom boredom boredom! during, if it may be
      suggested, that inevitable prolonged moment when
      your life ascends irretrievably to the outer cold and
      falls into the fixed trajectory of the permanent
      orbit and reality retreats whirling below and
      behind, its weight dragging at you with a force of
      5 to 15 G's and pressing the multiplied tons of your
      own existence against your chest like the final remorse,
      and, as you thence become separated once and forever
      from your own old self, able to view it all and yet
      unable to distinguish anything whatsoever in its particular
      homely details, which in any case always revealed far too
      much: when, in short, in short it is finally too late and
      history is all there is left to you and illumination
      comes out of the infinite black depth and you know
      that there was no way to have known that what you
      somehow knew, somehow knew, was really accurate and
      true...and then it is that that appalling dream
      suddenly comes back, that dream which woke you
      even from the heavy sleeping arms of your beloved...
      blue and red and white flames glinting and
      glaring on the midnight's horizon like silent
      slow explosions: a couple of old dolls flung
      seeming grotesquely alive in the corner of
      the dusty room, words and phrases uttered in
      the air, raucous wild syllables breaking out
      of the cackles and growls, sentences spilling
      into threats and moans and futile supplications
      as if one had suddenly but irrevocably abandoned
      the world one had made... do you com-
      prehend this? one's own created world! which
      had seemed so bad, so ugly and untrue -- but,
      perhaps, only because it was one's own?
Youth was his fountain, the world round.
He'd sail out, command a starved crew,
conquer realms, colonize the night:
he'd leap ashore in battle suit,
brain casqued in steel, fists bared to dawn,
and open simple colloquy
with eternity's nude natives,
bellowing, I, Conquistador!

But he wakes, pinioned and fettered,
in some ravine whose sandstone floor
takes no print of the silent camp
where dromedaries like shaggy ghosts
humped with silver in the moonlight
kneel about him, wheezing, sighing,
their bestial breathing the mutter
of a host of sorry spirits.

He smells the rank odor of force.
No, he thinks, a mere dream ofdeath.
This is not that sleep of all sleeps,
not demons, these hooknosed Arabs
who smoke incessant cigarettes
from cuppedfingers of slender hands...
these are men, living men, not djinn --
I'll wake saft in a burst ofsun!

But on he sleeps, this marooned man,
this imperialist of night,
ravelled in a skein of mumbo,
wrapped up in shrouds. And now he sees
that fabulous gloryglory,
his western pinnacles of power,
fall down in rose shards in his mind:
the world is round, he has returned.

They gag him as he prays for dawn,
and they truss him on a camel;
they run him (how he prays for dawn)
through the longest desert of night
to the dark interior's market:
the Emperor of Eldorado!
(who prays for dawn, though never crowned)
The Emperor! Enslaved. For sale.
Well, no one considered anything wrong:
foxy grandpa limped to his farm in the hills,
the brat fetched and carried and grew up strong,
we slept with her maids, she slept with her chills.

Love costs money, we said, what good's delay?
We dined and we danced, played at arms, shot craps
and spent our few good years like a spring day.
We welcomed strangers for we feared no traps.

You know what happened, they teach it in schools:
we paid for discourtesy with our lives:
love is faithful and we -- were a pack of fools.

It may save you running, so let's get it straight:
there are two nowheres: here, where man arrives
and there, where he pursues a withering mate.
As his old marrow clotted in his loins
he tottered. Shadows crossed the air, a smell of musk
cloyed the day -- these last hours jangled like coins.
He wept. He thought he'd creep into the dusk
because all his sons were lost: dead in piles,
or dying; ravens flopping down on husks
of busted armor; the dogs loping miles
to carrion... he'd take the barge for Avalon.
But what of the jewelled sword? Friendly smiles
meant nothing. What of the Queen? His hand on
her breast meant sons, his hand on its hilt
conquest. Better to parley than travel on,
man to man. "I would keep my power: my gilt
sword, my longthighed, milkbellied, pearbreast Queen
whose hair darkens the night. You know my guilt-
I have fidgeted the world, flubbed feasts, and seen
her stiff on her throne,whimpering in bed.
Business and drink. Now my knees quake, and green
bile stains my beard: this account is scored red
on my crusted brow. Yet still I lust: my
foot stands in the world among all these dead,
among cowards and lovers. I will not die!"
What was desire -- Dido bawling from the cliffs,
her general mulling fresher conquests,
that gorgeous insipidity -- has gone:
there are high heels clacking in Saskatoon;

what might be -- when little stars are great suns
in a universe too large for discourse,
lucid difficulties like adult poems,
so austere a jazz -- blinds in this shadow;

what is -- neither convoy nor residence,
nothing remembered, nothing found -- we have:
our wish, engineered climate, draftsman's walls,
and our life, single minds in double beds.
The old man is tired.Those insurance men
who sold him life with policies are dead.
He paid them out, he gathers interest now,
and scrawls his memoirs in the blank ledger.

There were women. Their bones fill his gray bed.
He thinks he has them yet like ghosts whose breath
is soft as his. All his snows have melted
in the same sun each year. He does not sleep.

He learned what there was to learn, left doubts room,
even reached this uninhabitable coast:
what were limits to him? But I'm his child.
I'll pay my own way, thanks. I'll bury him.
Below the tree lines
love runs its rank course
in hungry diligence
and all are slaves, none free,
pack wolves prowl through pines
but pure ways of force
suit lone intelligence:
these peaks belong to me.

Here is no men's dust
to soil the white sun
for no men know such noons,
creatureless, filled with light,
where the ice kills lust
on rocks beings shun:
such tracts polish dulled moons
and gratify the night.

Men's need for others
cannot look above
where giants in the snow
walk free and live apart:
I have no brothers
to command my love,
the grimmest winds that blow
will never touch my heart.
The doors of Numa's Arcade hang open,
and these hordes press through our dreadful Forum
where broguing Duffy, conscripts' chaplain,
shoulders and brow shagged with pigeon droppings,
broods in the sanctum of The Great White Way,
mastiff/toothed and parsing his bronze prayers:
Flesh is bread, blood is wine. Lay mine altar!
Dominus, you who ate your god in bogs,
cannons' Canon, whose masses your Mass,
Father ours: shall these drunken demos live?

I take my chance where all is rigged, like chance,
and slip a nickel in the thumbworn slot.
Round me rabid Pokerino rages,
"King of Hearts! Queen of Hearts! Who wins this hand?"
Wild soldiers shoot at waddling wooden ducks.
The Knave of Hearts turns up, and the house wins.
It's cold. Hawkers of horns baa in the snow.
What of the future? Would this machine know?
My coin drops: amber bulbs buzz and flicker:
an old bellows wheezes astral music.

In the ancient blue flaked mirror I see
my dead uncle: Java Man: trepanned skull.
He holds my hand out and takes his message.
Once more the word made new he cannot read:
YOUR ANALYSIS little concentration
you have temperament your moods too deep
quick to change intolerant lovable
abilitypersonalitymentality poor
your life can be guided subconscious ly
you should have faith you will die
Bafflement for bafflement. It is just.
I join the throngs of frozen revelers.
Under dense low clouds boiling red and blue,
mounted on marquees, waiting midnight's knell,
technicians garbed in flyer's dress scan us
televising to an unsleeping world
how time in tumult takes its harshest turn:
pale pimpled boys and patchy painted girls
laugh, yell, scream, blat Bronx Cheers from tin trumpets,
lope by flourishing pints of cheap whiskey.

I cross to Duffy's Rock in the traffic.
Beneath his silence a bum harangues us:
"Augh! Men of mine, women! Be warned by me:
time is, time was, but time is not to be!
Isle of shining towers, stones ofManhattan,
steel, glass, you happy peoples of the North:
the day has passed, the hour comes!" Who hears him?
He's drunk, he's blind, he's old and feeble.
He slumps, drooping to his derelict's doze.
Some hand stuffs a scrawled note in his stiff claws.
I give the prophet my chocolate bar
and some cold pennies (Lincoln and Legend),
in exchange for this last poor chance writing.
It reads: go get 68 West 36 Street!
wants to kill me and father who's decent
give me my things from his crime morgue room shop
212 West 110 Street holding my bankbook
stop him interfering with my life
get the unsane to attack me in Harlem
pleasure to die from 120 Street B'way crimes

Now it comes: death strikes like birth! Eyes up, all!
As if tomorrow brought yesterday's hope
above, around, among, within their eyes
seas of dulled stars anticipate chaos
roaring like the last clocks and the first
with a noise as of mobs roaming and lost
confusion triumphant in their joyful praise
without this fated drifting gray despair
burdening even the silent old stones
but passing away, but passing away
You have brought me to a despair deeper than poetry...
To have forgotten poetry!

I should sing a song of remorse to you
That you may cry Well done!
And hang your stone around my neck...

This is what you are:
Settled comfortably in the suburbs of mortality
Not interested in birds without wings
Having no expectations of honesty
     (telling the truth you lie most of all)
Dependent on bureaucrats for information
Your secular joys are secretly shameful
You did not leave a space blank for holiness
You have weak ankles you fear to challenge fate
     (unlike certain reckless skeletons we knew
     whose bones, hung in the wind, are musical)
You are so careful you take vitamins and prudent exercise
In your old age you will think of nothing but lecheries!

Small loves, I denounce you!
Your advertisements and all your friends
Your knowledge of the score-provincial gregariousness

You are always camping somewhere:
On shaking hands properly or dressing in good taste
On current events, the corrida, silent German films, ritual guilts
On clever jobs, with or without futures, or on Fellowships
On the American Musical and editing good books
Amateur skills like exotic cooking exquisite cabinetmaking collecting
On very wellpaid regional directorships raising money for humanity
On Etruscan Byzantine Ceylonese Han Navajo scholarship
Camping on Bohemia, on destitution, on an income
East and West Coast jazz sodalities
Dealing in abstract art, temple/dancing, gamehunting with cameras
On being beautiful
On selling reproductions in museums or tickets at airline desks

On sonnets and villanelles
On drug addiction and on God, prayer even!
You small loves, you camp on heterosexuality, on homosexuality
     and on marriage too!
On certain beaches in Spain
On the undiscovered retreats of the French avant/garde
     in the South of France --
Wherever it might have been interesting to go or be.

Small loves, I renounce you!
I won't get drunk at your party or keep Siamese cats...

What is it like on the Flying Dutchman
Where is the country of love
Where you come groaning
Without pity for my nakedness?
Once to wake proud in a burst of sunlight
as bearing news of real significance,
to risk cold coffee for that native hour,
unembarrassed at much cruel rapture
and clothed with an astonished nakedness
the other animals must remember:
those brunts of darkness in the opened eye
which must accept all the retributions
called justice, called civilizing peace;
to know that moment, pleasure of action,
of a world swayed by irrelevant tides
where men scorn beds made simply for sleep,
is life at a high price, without napkins,
minus the morning's editorial,
an unimaginable selfrespect
of the very young and the very old:
those who fear discipline as they fear death.
An impossible hairpin curve
the guardrail recently smashed --
we stopped there and picnicked

We had only an hour, love
there is never another time, or place
still, how useful to recall it now

The dark, deep, boulderstrewn gorge
and down down, so white and hard and swift and loud,
the foaming cataract!

And then, love, from the high, rough road
winding out at last (but too soon!)
to see that populous valley in the dusk

And to find the neon beds all taken
(though there wasn't one we could have afforded)

And so driving on all night, smoking, thinking
the car bringing us, eventually, to such different places
She came across the seas steerage class
in her middle age, past childbearing
her husband sinking into dotage
having sired two males upon her
and seven girls, none of them grateful
for her services as cook and char.

Her husband gone, at seventy-five
she had a hard stroke but was redeemed
by that young doctor who tapped her spine
and drew offin a pint of fluid
the troubling clot -- so that she lived on
blind in one eye, deafened, rather weak.
Another fifteen years she survived
uselessly dimming in the poor corners
of a household her last two daughters
destroyed by their ignorant furies,
lapsing incontinent, a burden
had she known it even to herself.

She endured her perishing a week:
bothered three days with what seemed a cold,
pausing one night to let them bicker,
Who'd buy drugs? Who'dpay doctors? Her costs!
and slipping three days slowly, slowly,
toward those rattling rasping sighs, and death.
She was through yet she wasn't finished:
consigned that hour to morticians
her hamper of flesh and bent old bones
were zipped up in a green canvas sack
and bundled off -- as they wept a tear
for mother, and two more for themselves.

On the next day at twelve/thirty sharp
she reappeared in Chapel C, West,
in a plain coffin of good grade oak
to be viewed by mourners where she lay
dressed in raw muslin, washed and powdered
and neatly stitched: she seemed someone else.

A short service for this old stranger
THE FIFTH COMMANDMENT'S IMPLICATIONS
CONCERNING FILIAL OBLIGATIONS
delivered by a rented rabbi
in a spate of Buchenwald Yiddish,
broken Hebrew and passport English.

And then that sleek new Cadillac hearse
driven by a rakish/capped chauffeur
who wears aviator's sunglasses
and knows the fast route across the Bronx
over the Triborough Bridge to Queens
out expressways to the granite gates.

It's a glorious Spring afternoon,
three robins dispute this hunting ground,
that man speaks his mangled speech, O God!
and the sandy loam is shoveled back
tactlessly neutral, filling the hole
making my brother's nose twitch with fear.

As the family turns toward the cars
he points at the Queens College buildings
beyond the graveyard's west wall and says
"Next Fall when I'm admitted I'll drive
to campus over the Whitestone Bridge"
and I say "Taking Humanities?"
           No world but this for your eye:
      space without nebulae, comets,
   neither cosmic dusts, stars, gas, debris,
nor, nearer, planets, sun, moon, cloud, hill, plain,
trees, birds-nothing inhuman to stir pain
   and make us love what eyes learned to see
      when forepaws left their rude comments
           on things, saying X was I.

           No world but this in your space:
      where all is free, where being's forms,
   born of human force, live from your act
of grace in spectrums unknown to God's white,
thrive in space like souls passing time when light
   strikes fractured glass, sand, paint smeared and tracked
      by palette knife-such random storms
           whirled over your human face

           as never racked God's creatures.
      Who can commit you then to God
   when all things are His but yours, Jackson,
who to say, "Sandy cemetery clay
holds this broken drunken artist whose play
   was work, work splash of bitter lakes on
      silent unsized canvas where good
           and bad never have features

           as in God's world of moral things,
      God's numbers not at last nameless,
   sexual, violent, or skillful
as you were in those desperate movements
of your times at work, at play, those moments
   bourbon, breasts, brush made living artful
      and so self/willed, dying aimless
           and unmindful of God's real things?"

           Won't someone ask, when flowers
      dropped by Kline, de Kooning, pale wife
   and fifty ranking abstract friends wilt
on your new grave and funeral turns wake,
wake floats toward next weekend, when for your sake
   flesh becomes void again, denied, killed
      for love of something in this life
           called art, "Are all man's hours

           zeroed like yours in God's eye
      and ours in yours, Jackson, useless
   colored space minus natural line,
naked spirit's elaborate gestures
knowing nothing in truth but these vestures
   of itself in its own masculine,
      own feminine, with no address
           but this home in time, this I?"
The follies of the Sanhedrin prepared
us for innocence: a high August sun,
shore of broken conches emptied of flesh
by local synods of gulls, this tumult
of waters patched now blue, now gray, now black,
swashing about surf-fishers' knees. Like posts
they stand, casting, reeling, casting, reeling,
roughdressed, rawhanded, stubblefaced, staring
at the blank stretch of sea, while behind them
flies quarrel over scraps of stinking bait.

Even God deserts his echoes: silence
confounds the drone of antique deliberations
whose heavens were harsher than life: dismissed,
our elders trudged to their tabernacles
in the moral fires, leaving us this world.
Is it strange to be content to be hopeless?
Consider burrowing nations of clams,
or fat porgies scrounging those taut fish lines.
We have no answers: questions need we none:
Though marrow is not nectar, call it bilge?

Grant concessions to animus, oh sure,
one glance shows the dumb fury of this Point:
rocks plunging awash, a tide'bitten beach,
the necessary lighthouse at the end,
monstrous squalls and human desolation.
So, we're paupers staring east at zero...
Yet grant too this bland hour's better than most:
we sit near the good and the true, smoking,
talking our jargon. Out of the welter
we plucked breath, and a pail full of beach plums.
Eve is angel, though bone of bone. She is
the wealth of women, she makes my garden
love's maze, all flesh and fruit: the sweat of bliss
is dew upon our bellies. She is the warden
of this world, and its colors speck her eyes
as richest soil her hair. Fear can't harden
her heart, silver under breasts of gold: cries
from dispossessed night burnish her sweet sleep.
Yet I hear you from Eden, where wind sighs
over the ruined metropolis, where you keep
vigil in that waste, mounting your old tower
to watch deserts of stars, count dead moons, and weep
the dust from your eyes. Even here this hour
is yours, Lilith, my demon wife before time,
like my years before the sun, my power
knotted in your long black hair. Steps that climb
to Eden lead down again. Heirs of blood
may walk in the shade with Eve, giants prime
yoking the mammoth mountains to her good
will and farming men in her big daughters.
They may stretch their dominions over the flood
of time, and crown Eve mother of waters-
but, Lilith, your song rises from the stones' curse
at night, and I turn to hear you. No laughters
of sons, no wife from my bone, can drown your voice.
Regime falls on regime, a flood of stones
pounding the horse plains, burying strangers
and beloved together in the cause
of no community and of no life
but one: the way of flags, standards of death
displayed by hordes riding always without hope.

Scorned, denied, banished from today, the hope
of thought broken where these broken stones
crush the choked, smoking streets: a place of death,
children killing, children killed by strangers,
no quarter for thought: yet hope still, still life
makes way among the ruins and seeks a cause.

Killing or killed, we will not yield our cause
to them nor they to us, there is no hope
of settling the ways of passion with life:
out of old ways come civil streets and stones
to pave and build, but out of life strangers
with fire hot in their hands come bringing death.
Ungentle then these crossroads, filled with death,
enfiladed from all sides in no cause,
to no end: we foreign and they strangers
firing in darkness and blind with the hope
that sunlight lights the others heaped on stones,
that hatred's nights no longer rake this life.
Stairs blasted, riddled walls, the garden's life
of peace unhonored by gardeners whose death
is sowed and reaped with force among these stones:
on every hand neglect: neglect of cause,
ends neglected while time wastes and dear hope
rots with neglect... a waste where strangers

wander unmeeting, avoiding strangers
who will ask alight, for the time: Your life,
your life, give us whateveryou would hope
to have or save or take :you are lost,your death
is here, now,forever, and for your cause
you shall die and be buried under stones!

What is fit for stones is fit for strangers:
our only good cause going from the life
where men find death, where slaves can only hope.
Once again, undressing for bed late that night, we
looked shyly at each other in anticipation of the joy
wandering the nearest landscape one knows, perhaps
expecting the calm rest that belongs to fortunately-
settled natives. We were shocked to see the bloated
bellies of long starvation!

Then, as the moon went out and we tossed in sleep in
the darkness, what did we hear? A scurrying of
timid ground~dwellers, chipmunks, mice, rabbits,
foxes; whirring of wings beating among the forest
leaves; cracklings and crashings of deer and bear
through the dense brush? We thought them mythical
premonitions...

Human contours remain the last anfractuosities for
the ambitious explorer. Let him be warned in advance
of his researches: in the dark -- let him consider
this -- in the dark, and with the clock pressing
more loudly at his ear, what exactly will he be able
to put his hands on? Even he who is most attentive
to intimate processes is afraid to contemplate this sudden
record of catastrophe. Erosion,
drowned chasms, uplifting of the very roots of the
range -- those long-hidden Cambrian basalts lying naked
when the sun struggles through the
thin smoky curtain of consciousness. What must have
been successive and profound temblors: to have gone
unnoticed! Only then did we realize what a delusion
our hopes of breakfast were...
Away with that tradition of wretched glory
Sustained by the memory of certain deep caresses
That dream of lovers, and enemies- to have each other!

Wealth upon wealth! your charity impoverished me...
Was it right, was it good, to seek our humanity?
Alert, but wisely blind, like mirrors engaged: a nightmare!

Because your solicitude gave me what I wished
Oh my friend, may my generosity plunder you
Surfeit drown you, burn you, leave you to my death!

Forms emptied, momentary purity, each from each, unbound
And then, breakfasting on carbon, to find our equivalents,
Pleasures exquisite and black sentiments-obscure concentrations!

Yet to take, forget, take again and, unremembering, take once more!
I measure you with my fingers, and these estimations begin. Endless!
As if to understand, to accomplish ourselves, or become happy!
Poisoned, by our own lips! That exchange of eloquence...
Having worshiped too long in the same place-that radiance!
Our theory decayed into hard passions, perishing bits

Except the work to be done, nothing true can be known
Flesh parallel with flesh, ourselves merely the objects of force
As if love alone were precious! Now do you comprehend government?

Hence we joined, entering this silent momentum of things
Was it to resolve chastity that we opened our eyes in the dark,
Yielding tender as stoics to the mutualities of conquest?

All things are joyous but joy, whose kisses are blows
Compressed, heavy, durable-broken matters come to earth at last
Thus we grew human, having abandoned nothing but life

Yet, enlarged and preyed on by tomorrow, we will be hungrier
Rally the despairing fractions, command them to this new world
So that, iron ringing in our bones, we shall seem admirable killers!
You gave them all the dances, but came home with me
Then we bathed, and anointed each other with true lies
You showed me fields in the sea: I promised wild, honest tigers

To have torn ourselves away, lost them everywhere around us
Miracle! aspiring yet again and only to such nakedness!
They will say we lacked compassion, like survivors

Neither mine nor yours the courtesy of rotten states
Their archives burdened by the news of perpetual disasters
Absurd communities, cities rooted in our very hearts-gone!

Having destroyed ourselves and risen, ourselves once more
We drink this wine, resting content in the fruitful, bright mirage
Wanderers, come here! Green and gay, the world without hate or love

There, those shadows whirl grasping their possession, alive as ghosts!
But remember, remember we are real, it is no dream --
Soon we die, embracing and alone -- remember we have lost nothing.
         To pass inhuman barriers
      heroes were by ancient ritual
  brought most bloody forth from loins ripped wide
in bestial labor: they sprung from childhood
joy and fell in virgin manhood
  on divine traps: strange deaths stained their pride
      with glory grim yet natural
         to men lacking man's terrors.
         Leave them in myth where they lie,
      destroyers of all decency,
  brave but in excess, as though God's wilds
were gardened rich without domestic tools
or flesh home enough: who today is fooled
  past what tested powers prudence wields?
      No man knowing love leaves men, he
         fears that hero's wish to die.
         (Icarus, that callow youth,
      that amateur doomed in contempt
  of the laws of motion, comes to mind:
beeswax and feathers ruined by the sun
to adorn the maxims that kept Greek sons
  down on the farm, on foot, with their kind-
      are heavens heaven when attempts
         on heights reach but to such truth?)
         Captain Apt: no hero found
      in legend falls with such a fall,
  bound unwarned, unwilling, unmade for death,
professionally cautious every day,
a family man needing his week's pay
  though working beyond life's reach where breath
      takes thought, where his something is all,
         and nothing's silence surrounds.
         Those who came back from such flight
      do not talk with heroes' accents
  of what they know: Chuck Yeager the bold,
aging Gene May, restless Bill Bridgeman and
one who broke through first and died, de Havilland:
  that tremorless high arc, still and cold,
      Mach 3 on twenty/mile ascents,
         that peace of most intense light,
         and that flameout at the top,
      weightlessness, shadow/blotched dials,
  null trim/control: that long loathed drop down
buffeting, burning, shattering through air,
plunged worse than the damned falling in despair,
  that deadstick landing on native ground,
      that fearful gearing for new trials:
         a day's work that never stops.
         Such means mean ends: you perished
      in the name of power and life
  on routine assignment, testing walls
of shock, of heat, testing blood bone and metal,
force on naked force that we may settle
  squatter's claims on God's desert that calls
      the soul as man is called to wife:
         that children may be cherished
         amid universal storms,
      that cabins may grow to towers,
  tribes to nations rampant who shall find
solace paving boulevards of empire
which run past all barriers to desire
  and plant on barren worlds the strong mind
         that loves love's domestic powers,
         love's homemaking human forms.
The giant blooms amidst green damnation,
swollen ecstasies of this timeless realm,
elegant, unblessed. Old hothouse roaches
trot along lianas on their roach affairs.
Hot, hot beneath glass, the dour pineapple
and the sweetish lemon, greengold and thinskinned,
ripening sans honor: athletes and esthetes.
Fat frogs squat steaming in bowers of blood
and tumorous copper carp fin idly
at the conduit. There is nothing but life.

There is nothing but life but love. The pyre,
the searing mantle, the egg in embers,
the new pinions, a hundred years of youth:
earth, air, water, the greenhouse sun at noon:
all heaven in a pot: Adam virgin
brooding in his sterile zoo. But when she comes
swanking to his couch the dust lusts
in the desert and time begins society:
the sun runs, the moon is pregnant with stars:
under domes of glass there is laughter.

They stroll on tidy paths, flesh. Nimble Jack
and Nimble Jill in the hothouse jungle:
their fathers kings, and queens their mothers.
They walk, they talk. They sit, they smoke, and they kiss.
Lovers laugh at rumblings in the bush:
cities rise new in their arms, their arts conquer men:
there is no other choice but to love.
Old closing time shoos them kindly. Outside
it is snowing. Their selves of laughter meet
their tears. There is nothing but love but death.
You said, How strange! Among all who have come by, only
you guessed my name. Hardly. I could not have done
otherwise. And now, what is mine?

No matter where it fell, the seed must do its best to become
its unknown self. If you believed morality necessary too,
consider the agony of the plant: its only life, desire.

That permanent diet they forced on us -- how young we
were! Some warm room, food enough, a few cigarettes,
and everywhere in our thoughts those loudspeaking
communities instructing us. By such dry passions they
obliged us to persist, despite everything, in the one
direction: towards life.

Thronged streets, people whispering, What? What? Pale
swaths of filmy radiance, ivory, rose, chartreuse, ozone blue,
sweeping overhead though not dimming the stars: the Northern
Lights! Before dawn a total eclipse of the sun, calculated
how many scores of years ago, would surely begin, eastward
over the Atlantic. The great age must be near.We waited,
heroic as lampposts. Clocks ticked loudly, then softer
again: sighs of married sleepers. Also, through the
short, hot night, the thrilling noise of shattered
glass-windows, bottles. Barriers and containers.
That perpetual sedentary economy! Well, but if you cared
you could manage for a few years, living together like a
family. Yet when it came, on whom would the sun shine?
Oh my dear hope, how frightened you are.

As for thought -- plunged like an aging actress in her
barbituric pool. Darkness, and talk was misery; it filled
the ashtrays. In awhile, the tide at full, men would be
concentrating on charts held unrolled beneath the sufficient
glow of their binnacles. Business and pleasure: always
somewhere to go and a way to get there. Yet as though
hopeless, we brewed another pot of coffee. You could
almost feel the waters start on ebb. We knew what was
happening to us: it is never the first time for those who can
remember their birth.

You were taught one of the histories, and so you take the
huge vagary of the present for granted. My faith in
nothing, not even in what I do (my show of life!) makes
you anxious. You wish me to possess you, just as you
need to possess me. You even survey and dig into
tomorrow: you suppose that buying an old well'built
house and moving it to your own new foundation where you
can overlook this dairygreen valley in which farmers fought
side by side with Indians will bring us to America. All
right, then what? You'll only see me there, mowing the
lawn again. Maybe I stop, go to the ragged screen of privet
to peer through. Maybe I've glimpsed the shadow of
ruin moving once more in Mr. Wester's tall August hay,
careless as the black bear who slouched through sumac
at the bottom of the meadow. A tremor. You will recall
what a surprise our meeting was, too. Springs flowing
in one eon, in another not...

One need only want to join those who have imagined the true
change of season to understand that space and time exist,
and yet do not. For each one of those thousand miles
separating them from that brief life lovers have
prepared a fear, each fear the thought that stops them, and,
stopped, they stand forever contemplating the killing distance
that lies beyond the next step. Look, the first piece of gravel
I pick up from my driveway reveals a fossil snail!

For we have no destiny at all! This planet spins on, fixed
in a lucky orbit. The single stars themselves, which we
resolve as clusters of random, dimming universes, drift
nowhere. Dreading your reply, I said, Where do you want
to go? It was what I expected, the only one: With you.

As long as the car was moving, whatever we said made sense.
And whenever we stopped for the night it seemed useless to
utter anything but the common syllable of endearments.

Day and night, the diesels of the combines roaring. Cutting,
husking, threshing, baling, bagging, loading, they disappear
over the flat bluegray horizon, following their compasses
north/by/northwest. High summer. The spume of their
exhausts, grayblue, tinges the haze. Up in the sky swifts
and swallows careen; redwinged blackbirds tilt on the
fenceposts; crows cross cawing at dusk and dawn. There is
no such thing as America -- only the plowing up, the plowing
under. So that our lives are like all those yesterdays:
before and after the orange and yellow squads of combines.

Because there is neither digression nor return, but
merely cessation, we remembered to kiss goodbye.
Once on the way we perceived strangers everywhere,
in everything terror. Had we abandoned our life
for what was barely possible? Yet it would have been wrong
to protect ourselves. For later, in that standard and
familiar rented American room, helpless in the net of the
deepest embrace, we cried out to each other, spontaneously,
But who are you!
But I want you to understand
I find myself here to be known
Just as out back this piece of land
Waited ten years lying grassgrown

I myself an arm of no race
To stoop like that first settled man
And touch and probe this fallow place
To make it give me what it can

I revealed it like an old chest
Covered with books and webs of dust
Stripping it bare as my wife's breast
I pondered its promise and my lust

Tumultuous vegetables
Green striving, beans, corn, peas, it's true:
Nourished loves create our fables
Innocent powers, I've found you!

That was one of my morning dreams --
As if plenty were life, were all
To have to know to do clay's themes --
That was wisdom before the Fall

When light fails these mad weeds come through
My rows groan, deformed: ah poor patch!
Like my nightmare I feel cold dew
As if I could bear it I'll watch

Mumbling monster rabbit who creeps
Full and silver magnificence
My gardened human folly sleeps:
I'm here for my deliverance!

Haunting the lives of all you glide
Murdering owl, who know the worst
Bring us truth wherever we hide
In hunger and hope we die cursed

Yet may we rest safe and rest well
May I not hear the rabbit's scream
And waking to dawn's mist not tell
How I died waiting in my dream
Our lives are not renewable, yet we seek extinctions.
The effort needed to subdue and suppress that wise
fear, that monstrous tenacity of nature in us which
protects us from ourselves! What do we hope to
discover in disaster: further cycles
of growth, perhaps achieving the new capacities...?
Is that why I betrayed
you? Everywhere. In everything. As we ate and slept.
Even before our long spring began, when the sun came
back with fresh light and winds out of the south
breathed upon the black sodden valley, recreating
grass and the blossoms as though from memory. It was all
food. We were promiscuous as bees. Yet I was always
alone, aspiring toward my own fulfillment. In our
common acts of love most of all. And you?

Leaves drooping coated with red dust. Confused by
the humid glare of an overcast afternoon sky, the
wild bees swarm irritably. The yellow hay has
finally stopped growing; waist-high it stands
waiting the mower. What was that long season of
flowering but time's metaphor? Errors ripen now,
impersonal as our joys -- those accidents and
brief coincidences in which matter clings to matter
like the touches of love. And the seeds scattering,
somewhere to overcome us: the same things returning,
inexorably full of themselves. We should have
known, expected it. But how?

Sitting by the road I watch the cars. Their passage
raises the clayey dust that chokes the leaves.We
have conquered this narrow strip of space in which
all are born. But what are those blank impassive
faces people show? They pretend to hide
our secret: that we go everywhere and come to nothing,
that even in the necessary and lucky exchanges of
pollen which preserve the world yesterday robs us
of tomorrow.

So that we must destroy our lives because life has
destroyed us. Burning ways random as our unknown,
equivocal desires through time, that abyss of silence.
Imagine it, through time!

I can spot where the bees are at work in the hollow tree
finishing their graywalled, goldfilled
catacombs. The thinning coarsened foliage dies out,
stiffens, blackish/green. In expectation of the suns
of coming years, our cousins the living things have
increased themselves and multiplied. Now they
halt: they will wait, without the vanity of hope: and
they will survive their own deaths. But we, driving,
driving, do not slow-although when we are gone,
in a month, in a year, who will claim the strange
harvest of this incessant wintry assault upon ourselves?
One could not want a clearer season, when things age but
   do not grow, time fit for true meditations
the stained white house thrown up by summer's storm, stranded,
   abandoned on this crisp crackling backwash of brown leaves
all the birds asleep, huddled away from the frost owl, or flown
   whence their seasonal imperatives direct
and that gibbous moon, gleaned of color, dull as the rimed stooks,
   rocking on a porch of Prussian blue.

I, however, do not sit in the dark looking out at this
   transparency, this quasi-philosophical Kodachrome,
but by a bright light ponder, considering next week's lectures,
   and think what I shall not say:
supposing Poe sober-sane, Hawthorne utterly mad, both, like myself,
   uxorious, in love with necessity
and up against it, its rigors and crotchets, etcetera, baffled by
   will and desire, baffled oh by right answers.

But it is very hard to think, because the flies have gone berserk,
   buzzing buzzing buzzing
they beat against my clean ceiling, where in consternation have
   they come from! and bash bash bash
indiscriminate, even for Musca domestica, beating about the bulb,
   caroming off the shade,
like spitballs whizzing, hopped-up like protons in a cyclotron,
   they crack against my face -- and cling.

Ugh! it's not just the October chill has set this fly circus
   aswarm in crazy orbits --
their controls are shot, reckless senility misguides them,
   desperate, into these centrifugal throes:
unpredictable even to themselves, how can one stalk October flies!
   chaos! it is maddening!
yet, with calculated indirection, rather nonchalant, feigning
   purposelessness, I hunt these distractions down.

What I do, I clap hands over them as they sit-Hai! Hai! with
   a kind of Zen finesse --
they fall, stunned it would seem into thought, moreover still
   sufficiently alive for it,
wherefore, much against my better nature, I pull the brittle wings
   to calm the last agony
indeed to help them through their black October passage in dry
   meditation, as it were.

And for myself endeavor to give thanks for this their pestiferous
   excruciation (oh it is a sign!)
because, reckless, jumpy, despairingly unpredictable and
   buzzing beating bashing
I too make myself generally a nuisance unto God Who in this
   same night of Fall sits, alone,                                                        j
pondering a sensible rhyme for His Own Name -- to give thanks
   I say, that, distracted, He clap not His Hands!
You! whom the aged brandy does not burn
Cold lecher forcing technical boundaries
Dayblind, nightcalm, though bubs and bellies storm
Last judge of international anatomies
And you! sublime tricks breeding such quandaries
Smooth contraceptive eye, knee, lip, thigh
All contestants universal beauties
Quarrelling fuel, frantic for light

You! angels abroad weathering those abysms
Beyond me far as I transgress my natural
Having mounted beneath that hail of kisses
On perpetual stairs (dismal after the funeral)
And you too, her sonorities, thought infernal
You demand the bridge-the bridge, not seamen
And men for those hips undismayed though autumnal
Long hair, long laughter, and her cruel pleased mind

You, fluorescent in midnight blizzard! I see, I know!
Orbed bane striding through slush, spiritual beast
Rings of violet flaming as eyes, bare bleached brow
Hungry mouth of blue teeth, those sucked'out breasts
Naked ankles strapped on killing heels, such slut's taste
Beaked nose, clanging wrists, and hands bejewelled
Gaunt in black crepe, a satin-sashed grim cocktail dress
You! ponderable there so terribly tall

Is it you? So, it's you! "Hag, accuse, bless!"
Silent on she comes pointing that harpy's manicure
The car stalls Drunk Igiggle and retch "Blast!
O you! Hybrid! Roar, bitch! Make me-pure!"
        He himself suffering and starved
        He did not rain bread on me
        In ignorance begat me
        Cursed each way each way enslaved

        Unborn my mother killed him
        As my wife who loves me now
        And I beget children now
        In silence like his so damned

        Denying not nor affirmed
        Father such deaths as men live
        In pain continue to live
        Unconsoled unreformed

        Blood consumed secluded heart
        Who fought joys calloused by love
        Who thought forgiving true love
        Forgive me my love you feared

        And believe your ravaged breast
        And forget our chains of hope
        And reconcile without hope
        And reside restless at peace
She sorrowed because she pleased
While spring gave no more than sons
Her terrors born at her breast
Lost pursuing her poor moons

She wanted no wish but love's
Betrayed by trusting that truth
His flesh hers now in us moves
Perfections unknown by both

She was strong without wisdom
Her sons would take light from God
Mirrors that folly lives in
Returning horrors for good

She fought hard but we broke her
For we proved human as stones
Her fouled thighs tremble in fear
And we shall preserve her ruins

She knew no bliss but pain's way
Though hate bonds too like love's vow
Love brings all strangers all joys
Neither love nor hate we know
Love here whatever love declares is love:
   Life undressed like winter elms is dressed like life
   Beauty preponderant yet masked by beauty
   Design made glad and doomed and mad with design
   Stones beneath snow, gray clouds above: beyond,
   the flesh of stars is stone
Flesh bitter as the sea though kissed and bathed
   by sweet flesh
Truth believed like death which lives betrayed by truth
   Unknown the seeker, who finds nothing but what is
   unknown:
She, she names me: I come, I pray, I know, I name!
   but is it she?

Drive north from the city two hours, 
past the appropriate ridges and through 
the obligatory tunnel that cowers 
under the mountain. Hawks that flew 
solicitously near the roadside mowers 
return to their own named peak to view 
without judgment your entrance. Ask the powers 
of light and shadow to reveal the blue onion bulbs of the true 
Ruthenian Church amid wildflowers 
and steep vetch. Wind back as if you knew
by heart Cyrillic names of miners -- sowers 
of canonized fern and weed, and renew 
the threefold Byzantine Rite, as summer showers 
stream down and a yellow halo of mist to surround
the town rises slowly from the burning ground.

The town rises slowly from the burning ground. 
Watch the vacant homes, unsellable now, 
freshly blanched with strips of siding, the crowned 
churches, their Babel of tribal Masses below the show 
of sunlight on gold and copper; and the sky, split 
by brittle steeples. It is little grown 
from the company town -- patchwork village by the pit 
with omnipresent monument, the Breaker, flown 
like a buttress against the black mountain -- 
this the shrine of the Holy Order of Anthracite.
Though odors of bottom damp and methane 
no longer reek into the streets and ignite, 
the underground tunnels burn, and each vein 
of coal, potential fuse, leads to another domain.
It begins around the 4th of July,
you can smell the bleenies as you drive
past the Tamaqua Coal Breaker, where trees
and brush grown awry begin to patch up
the damage done to the hills, where you meet

head-on, vast troughs of lard set
on two-by-fours, tented, hoarding the cross streets.
By the Feast of the Assumption it all fires
to a feverish pitch (townspeople lined
for tickets, more pushy, prayerful,

beseeching than for the state's pick-six lottery.)
As novice priests don canvas aprons,
quick to be tainted by sizzling grease,
and (Ecce Homo!) they serve them up
in stacks of three, these wafers so rich

and life sustaining, only a Byzantine
god, forgetting his grief, could have divulged
the exact mix of ingredients. Though a certain nun,
peeling potatoes at devotions

claims the recipe is there to be heard:
When voices blend in polyphonic hymns
and the Mother of God takes the sweetest part.
We have a saying in Old Church Slavonic --
Preparing for a Feast Day is the highest Art.
Deep into the side of the mountain
we tunnel down, timbering the shaft
as we go. And when we hit the slick
black vein that straddles, upside down,
the town of Ashland, and masses up
in the convoluted bulk of Buck Mountain,
we let down the gallon pail
and rob a tiny bit of anthracite
from the hundred mile hidden spread
of the Philadelphia Coal and Coke Company,
sole owner of every foot of ground we walk on.

We are not the only ones. Holes proliferate
like minefire. The hill is covered with a pox
the company men are helpless against.
(We are all company men), brazen enough
to hitch a mule to a junk car,
weotug it uphill, park over the hole.
lacked up, the winding driveshaft
pulls up the laden bucket, while the lookout
sits inside in comfort. The old Pocono hills,
vacation land to the rest of the world,
give us back a little, what everyone else takes.
The day Christ rose from the dead
I drove upstate to the anthracite hills
out past Minersville, Coaldale, Slabtown,
till I spotted the golden cupolas
of the Lemko Church in Shenandoah:
blinding nuggets pressed from the carbon landscape,
rising atop homes and churches
of another ridge town, diminishing
and lungblack, scrubbed immaculate.

Over millennially blazing coal pits I drove,
through granulated hillsides,
by ruddy creekbeds, steaming rivulets
of the hidden Schuylkill,
vales of choking men
and a miner's bestiary: Bull-
dozers, Yellow Scoops, Longnecked Cranes,
Graders, Backloaders, Hoppers,
silenced by this day of denial,
I drive through the underworld out of which
a fossilized Christ so often rises.

And searching for the golden domes of the Lemko Church
and its icons -- yearning-eyed, idolatrous, and maternal,
I wended my way through the town's attempts at purgation:
taprooms, luncheonettes, bingo halls, polka dances,
which He, though not one to give faint praise or join in,
surely must have smiled at, secretly, amid the solemn Mass,
amid the uttered sighs of his leisurely stroll past:
Friday's suffering all but forgotten,
the taste of coal dust
barely a tickle now in His throat.
You are right, Lev Nikolayovitch;
that's the sad part of it,
sad from the very beginning.
Even as a melancholy roustabout
soldiering through the Caucasus.
Mare's milk may cure some bodily ills,
but what of that chronic disease
of untransubstantiated flesh,
which craves a vodka's nurture
or the flagellant's soothing caress?

Are the tiny notated moments --
scything through a field of rye,
cuddling children on the stove-shelf
of a peasant hut -- worth it all?
Interminable train rides, coughed up
secrets, moment's calm before
an old love makes thirst
unquenchable, only to be right
again and again, bearded and bast-sandaled
venerable and cranky.
Yes there is death and resurrection.
Yes there is change and constancy,
the gamut of gossip and gospel,
ask any old, deaf, fiddler.
The Maestro struts on stage in tight
black pants, he tips the hardware store
stool he's settled on, the score
of ocean pitches forth the night.

And helmsman, sailors, and their girls
carouse (right after lunch) and laugh
at sturm und klipp welling from staff
and line. The Maestro rashly hurls

himself into a sea that Wagner'd
have us drown in. But with a gasp
he stills the waves enough to grasp
another ship, upstage, anchored

to gloom and death and lost salvation.
He calls the whole thing off. Too slow,
he shouts, for this diminuendo.
The deathship that destroys elation.

Take five. We don't know why you're cursed,
doleful Dutchman, we've come mid-act
like you -- why nothing will distract
you from your role, too well rehearsed.

The Maestro's from Milan my box --
mates claim. The chorus finds his silly
faces charming. I think, South Philly,
catching his fingers pat the buttocks

Brushing by of lovely red-haired
Senta, whose faithful love alone
can lift the Dutchman's curse. Viols groan
regaining tune. We're unprepared

when her soprano surges to
a crest. The shock waves ripple and rake
the grand Academy, they shipwreck
the free-floating qualm that urges to

deny, deny, that we are saved,
like rescued sailors hauled to port.
I join musicians, bobbing apart,
they leave their watch, no more enslaved

to score, baton, or measured phrase
as Senta, warding off a cold,
halts her aria to unfold
a handkerchief, and so delays

this afternoon's one last refrain.
Whatever chance there was to lift
some curse now sinks or goes adrift
as horns' and woodwinds' waters drain.
Almost twenty years since my girlfriend's sister
ran off, we had to wade through a pre-dawn
spate of bodies -- fringe, leather, and sweat,
Hindu oils and acrid smoke, to ask
an ex-high school math teacher peddling
LSD, and then young runaway hillbillies,
Irish factory girls, and blacks whose
astrological signs served as names
for news of her -- cribbed-in, as we were
between highrises, the Art Alliance, Ethical
Society, Curtis Institute, funnelling breezes
into the crowded square, backdropped as if
by a huge wraparound poster
an artist of the times might have conceived.

Tonight, in the center of the square,
where in weeks a bandshell might rise,
I recognize a man I've seen a thousand
times on comers, squares, every block
party, celebration, museum terrace,
free concert, I've wandered through these twenty years.
He hasn't changed since I first spotted him --
picked out among the celebrants as not
one of the fleeting participants of the city's mysteries.
He limped, one leg shorter, and wobbled recklessly,
bulk threatening to topple even when he sat
on some bench or townhouse stoop, forever silent,
agape mouth like a text, divined, awaiting
codification: He looked lost in those
familiar places, having lost even
the reasoned sadness that released him, set
him free to scour the city. He noticed me,
I'm sure, each time. I thought him middle-aged,
though he'd transformed so little in those two decades,
I'm no longer sure he is not the reflection
of myself, caught obliquely in shop windows,
projected -- after some original astonished
glimpse of him -- out of some initial fear
that he saw me as tortured and alone
as I saw him -- or worse, that passersby,
so breezy in their elevation and style,
brushed by interchanging us in view.

Now, as dusk hardens into night,
he stands in the thinned-out park, not one of the
innumerable saviors of the universe I first
thought him to be, unpropped by the empty fish
pond and police hut. When he turns his head to face me
his whole doughy body follows, split-
second behind, and with a gentle wave
motion, before averting his eyes in a manner
I'd be forced to call coy, had he been
one of those student cellists who passed by earlier,
stirred-up, soul less burdened after a Bartok
recital -- he begins to walk.in circles,
his short leg leading him to spiral in,
in circles concentrically smaller.

I remembered that summer at the Jersey shore,
just after my girlfriend's sister ran off
and my girlfriend forgot who she truly was.
I stood on the beach with friends waiting for the moon
to slip into the night's pocket -- after
a day fighting breakers, stenches of burning
flesh, scattered parts of Leviathan
chopped-up and strewn across the beach, the feast
in which I could not take part: I too began
to wander in circles, slowed down eddy of whirlpool,
convinced, as I paced, each step, inches smaller
and angled in, that as my circle closed
upon itself more tightly and I approached
the sacred and hidden epicenter
into which all life resolved
I would no longer be visible.
Though it saddens me and causes great shame
to walk beneath the Frankford El,
I do it often now, as I did ten years ago.

And I am still an easy mark
for pigeons roosting in the bolted crevices
of the El structure, squat as the wives

of new Russian merchants blocking doorways
to fruit stands or hoagie shops, although they,
of course, are not a cause of my shame.

I remember when I first entered the canopy
of the El structure, not caring
about the subway train, here above ground and always

moving on. I sat, that first day, on the concrete
stoop of the Fidelity Bank
and spread notebooks and sacred texts

around me. I was writing a saga
called Fishtown, a piece that lacked,
unlike the El, the spiritual underpinning

capable of supporting and transporting
the living. It was then the pea-green slime
dropped on my head. In my innocence

I suspected not the doves, but the sloppy,
scaffolded painters coating the girders
that straddled Kensington Avenue. And I was outraged

that no one paid attention
when either nature or the working class
dumped on me. Although I have since

learned the difference between pigeon shit and paint,
there is always something new from the same vatic source
waiting to defeat us when we feel most sure.

Like Mrs. Sophia, the cardreader, rocking
behind her picture window, or the parading
school girls from Frankford High

or Little Flower -- named for the more delicate
Teresa, so meek and humble, whose ecstasy
never came; not from heaven, not from me.
Between the Allegheny and Tioga stops
of the Frankford Elevated Train,
a miniature mock-Georgian mansion
sits on the third story
of tarpaper and sloping asphalt fields
of unoccupied rowhouses.
The owner is never to be seen
in his split-second passage across the window,
though what little we know of mankind
shows that he raises doves or even chickens
and knows nothing of the silvery train
that rattles his coops, cracks his eggs,
and at ten minute intervals, slithers by,
attempting to shake him from his nest.
The view into the city draws us more
than the view out. Downtown riders cram the right
side, home the left. Even third floor apartment dwellers
on the west side of the tracks add to the imbalance:
spraypainted messages, flags, curtainless windows
with waving hags, propped-open exhaust ducts.
For the east is something other; past the cluster
of sandblasted churches, past refineries, docks, drawbridged
river; past reclaimed Jersey swamp, lie pine barrens,
gambling casinos, an ocean of adolescent summers,
wholly other than the city to the west;
whose alleys made labyrinthine by row homes
are brushed by the windows -- this view the child
longs for, so small, so long denied
the tops of things.
To understand the city
an archeologist would have to dig
up, through the layers of cheesy air
to find the coppery drainpipes, the not-yet-looted
shards, still intact, impossible to decipher
from the street, barely readable between stops,
the signs that have never changed. De-coding them
he'd find a different city reconstructing itself:
lush union halls, starry-eyed ballrooms, giant milkbottles,
pony stables -- place-named fish-town, fair-mountain,
hunting-downs, harrowed-gate. An archeologist,
a traveller, an artist, would have to dig upwards,
pass through the turnstyle and ride endlessly the El,
to realize how little
an angel or other functioning deity
knows of life in the city.
Next block a man bullhorns his Rosaries,
Hail Mary, full of grace crackles through
the alleyway. Drenched in their own sweet dew
the neighbors sit on stoops, await the breeze
that never stirs. And from the boarded store,
huge boxes blare Break on through, as shirtless
boys exchanging taunts without success
slurp, then stack by the gutter cans of beer.
The boredom grows more great along the block.
The toxic stench from Bridesburg incinerates
the air, now fully marbleized from pig stock-
yards. A child's punished cry lacerates
the frail gardenia stem my wife just potted.
Before I sleep I hear Pray for the Brokenhearted.
In Harrowgate tonight
I passed a bunch of kids
hanging on the steps
to the chocolate factory.
A girl's leg was dangling
from the concrete steps
and as I neared the place
the kids all squirmed about
and tucked it underneath
their own and sat unusually
still and quiet for this
uncooled weekend night.

A car pulled up, a woman
asked about her daughter.
-- How should we know, they say
collectively, and fidget
like some nervous bride
out of Lo Sposo Deluso,
new to the act of deception.
-- What's that? the woman sparks
catching a gleaming toenail
the audience knows is there.
But she, unschooled in farce,
does not leave her car
to lift the tablecloth
or fling the arras back.
-- Oh, that's not your daughter,
they say, sure she's fooled,
-- it's just her best friend Donna
sleeping off a drunk.
The woman drives away.

They know what all kids know,
that cunning masters force,
they've learned the rules of farce
from the cynic hanging on the corner
who laughs himself to death,
and when the street is clear
they reconstruct their plan
to drag her by the legs
behind the pizza parlor.
Only when her head
flops from step to step
and bruises paint her thigh
I order them to stop.

For she is just the age
of a medieval bride,
her sodden hair a spill
of knotted wilting jonquils
splayed across the sidewalk.
Her stomach is atwitch
though the rest of her
lies all motionless
and won't be roused by touching
sweet-talk and promises
her girlfriends sing and coo
into her jeweled ear.

The ruse is incomplete
but still the kids relax,
they think the girl will live
although they scatter up
and down the unlit street
into yard and alley
peeking out from bin
and dumpster, silent, shy
when the ambulance pulls up.

Left alone the medic bends
above the body, his fingers
playing up and down
the fretboard of her spine --
like Rigoletto presented
with the floppy sack
into which he thinks
his enemy is stuffed --
the neighbors all seem pleased,
exchanging nod and smile,
until the mother rounds
the block, escapes her car
left gunning in the street,
and dropping to her knees
just like the hunchback jester
out for his fool's revenge,
recalls some small prophecy
about this flesh and blood
halfheard and overlooked.
Let us be early Medieval of late Renaissance,
spike-featured Norman Christ
or bone-faced Dureresque peasant,
skeleton staining the flesh.

let us descend the granite steps
and gather at the river's edge
for today is an Eakin's day on the Schuylkill:
boat races, festive crowds, spontaneous celebration.
See the strong young men lift their sculls
from the racks and carry them overhead
like slender polished beetles
to the murky and opaque waterway.
See the girls sleek and oiled cheer them on,
the losers as well as the winners.
See the geese that summer and winter here
spring up over the island. See them sport
with one another in raucous feathery
gaggles and announce to the daily horde
the absence of human frailty.

For all seems well under the cutting sun:
Joan of Arc is heroically bronzed
though even she cannot halt traffic along the drive,
and Mad Anthony Wayne rears on his horse
with the famed golden testicles.
How miraculous we seem to ourselves on this fair mountain
as cyclists weave round us, in and out
of joggers and strawberry mansions.

There is more: deep in the earth
an orchestra plays something lush,
romantic, called back and tempered
by the limping Hungarian.
There on the bank I see
an old Black man --
fishing for catfish -- stepped from a genre painting.

But remember we have come to watch the boat races --
the crews in their sculls on the Schuylkill
2-man, 4-man, 8-man and coxswain,
barking his rubbery lips, stretched
over a frighteningly oracular beak:
Stroke! Stroke! Stroke!
and the coach puttering around
effortlessly in his motor boat,
looping lazy figure-eights about them
as they rain sweat, snap ligaments, and groan.
But this is only practice,
the race is soon to run.
Only then will these young oarsmen show
an old and tired Charon the ropes --
how to run his ferry faster
on this one of many rivers,
stroke by stroke by stroke.
I've waited so long for this, said Zosia,
at midnight I checked my drearnbook, my sennik,
and what it said of rushing waters was true --
more suffering and tragedy. The river
beneath the street rose up, it flooded
the intersection up to the stopsign,
it carried me all ten blocks to church.
So many people were waiting outside.

Czerw the kielbasa maker, the red coat lady,
the German forelady from the mill, my daughter
in her first communion dress all lace
and beads and sequins, seven yards of material
at least, even the Archbishop wearing his miter.
But they wouldn't let me enter the church,
like the time Ukrainian policemen
and their German bosses blocked the doorway

to my cousin's hut. This is also explained
by the sennik -- no answer will be found.
My insides ached all night, that's nothing new,
my daughter dead, one of my sons in jail,
my father living in a shed, he writes
another harvest will fail, my husband, what
can be said of him, he'd have me starve
or freeze to death and still he steals my food.

When I was married the whole village came
for one whole week. Grass still does not cover
the patch of ground out back where couples danced.
It was the first wedding after the war.
The night before my vows I dreamt of water.
My mother only laughed and tied the wedding cap
more tightly. My brother clubbed the pig to death
and slit its gut, scalded it with water.

I don't believe in dreams. When I planted
some myrtle by the grave of my daughter
to remind her of her difficult task ahead
in Purgatory, the monk scolded me.
I think he took the steamed barley I left,
or last week's rain washed it away.
In my dream she cried from hunger or thirst.
I don't need my sennik to tell me that.
I think of wandering through Poland,
walking into the fields,
sidestepping elaborate swirls of cowshit,
eating tiny strawberries
I bought from an old peasant woman.
She overcharged me -- knowing there are things
for which I would pay any price.

I wanted to buy beads for Teresa.
An old man had dozens
dangling from the top of his stall.
I thought of Reymont's novel,
when, in the Jew's marketplace,
old and proud Boryna meets
young and beautiful Jagna,
and buys her love for a string of beads,
a few acres of land.

Later they marry and she betrays him,
making bloody love to his son
behind the desperate and beautiful haystacks.
Teresa would not understand --
fathomable smile, shallowness breeding pain.

That was in Przemysl,
where I walked along the San River
through endlessly plowed fields.
I watched a man in white robes
holding a net on the end of a long pole
by a sewer that let blood from the slaughterhouse
to the river -- fishing out chunks of lard.

Afterwards I sat by the cows
and thought about war and love.
You can't have one without the other, I realized,
picturing the old woman with whom I was staying.
That night she enacted the fearful pantomime
of her. brother's death, handcuffed and shot
against a brick wall in the town square.
Hitler's armies on one side
of the river, Stalin's on the other.

I think of wandering through Poland.
A pigtailed girl leads the cows home.
An old man from a neighboring village
fiddles in the marketplace.
Men pass the day
rooted in front of the roadhouse,
drinking warm beer, gazing
at the cheekworn mountains.

Later I lie on the dusty riverbank
watching smoke from the peasant bonfires
echo through the hills, blanketing the evening,
knowing I could kill for love.
The fanfare from St. Mary's towering crown,
cut short for the thirty-thousandth time this year.
Long since the Tartars, shot the trumpeter down.
At five p.m. the riot police appear.
Inside the church homeless women shiver,
and workers' mangled knees whap the marble floor.
Sermons that the priest may not deliver
keep them lining up, coming back for more.
When I am stopped the policemen are polite,
visors raised, billy clubs encased. In pairs
they stand or stroll, one fiddles with his flashlight.
They might be shopgirls admitting their own affairs,
arm in arm, voices shrill, full of their own
importance. Turpitude on loan.
Be suspicious, I'm forewarned by the young poet,
of any writer who's managed to live here so long.
Since the fifties thaw, he means, on the first floor
no less, while he awaits eviction
from a fifth-floor walkup under a leaky roof.

Don't be fooled by his work with the Partisans,
his Home Army commission during an earlier occupation,
when he was barely as old as the young poet
is now. He can't be counted on, which is,
I'm instructed, different from being trusted.

But the old poet, son of a village organist,
looks like a hawk stripped of its urge
to prey. Gracious as an old bowtied hotel waiter.

Every word, gesture, thing, in this part of Europe,
chides the young poet, is political,
pointing out the precious gap, cloying and boisterous,
between my words, almost and free,
dangerous, unbridgeable, into which
one's friends might one day disappear.

What right have I to rummage through the past?
writes the young poet. He believes, he tells me,
only the language of bargehands, words to deliver
the tangible smuttiness of coal, flirt
with the young panienki selling trinkets below
Wawel Castle -- language that won't give
itself to any other abusive master.

And the old poet who emerged almost intact
from the failure of civilization with his friends
to become hopeful children in a new order.
Teach us how to live, they pleaded, step by step,
from the very beginning, how to eat,
how to build, how to love, how to write.

His poems, however, always whisk him back
to the harvest: Mother with an apron
full of feathers, where cows thrash about
in the sagging barn, and men shout
across fields grey with flax and rye.
Where everyone's invited to the wedding,
and only mouldering haystacks at night
watch and comment upon your nightmare cry.

I am helpless here. Lightheaded, inflamed.
After the requisite vodka, toasts,
and handkissing, we manage a slow descent.
Halfway down the well goes black.
Fearful of our steps, forgetting how to count,
my wife runs her fingertips along the walls,
searching like a censor for irregularities
in the crackling plaster. instead of a light switch
a doorbell is pressed. Some beleaguered poet
or his widow, charlady or porter,
is roused halfway to dawn. Like prankish children
we flee. A flutter of suspicion, accusation
rises up to the mouldy vault, its short sleep
abandoned -- for a more familiar perch.
Bluster of cold. The city's fortress walls
show ice in bleeding cracks and I'm alone,
though streets and cellar shops have teemed all day
with wildly gesticulating vendors. And everyone, it seems,
has something dear to sell -- radishes
and brooms, amber strands and ration clips.
Ideas. Complaints. Vestiges of fate.

And it is quiet here -- battering ram walls,
blanketed doors and racks of smoke
bulging to the ceiling's stuccoed vaults.
Two men I always see debate pre-war
disputes. A father late from work
works to charm his moping woolen daughter,
who tugs her braid and dabs it in some cake.

So I am free in here, where no one looks askance.
Everyone, it seems, wants to have
the same. Until they come -- the city's
deaf and mute contingent, silent mass
herding itself inside. Only a Gypsy
band, packed across the threshold of a restaurant,
can cause a greater stir, though the city's
Gypsies, dark with the grimy swagger of restraint,
know how to stir the soul. And these others,
who wear the leather boots, painted curls,
sheepskin vests, and oriental scarves,
fashions that identify the modern
youthful Pole, they are more than different.

They raise in me flutters of unease.
Their mimes are too extravagant -- simple
points entail the beating of a breast.
Grunts and snorts sound too much like the words
approximate. I know at once
who loves whom and who despairs of it,
who has funds and who must turn to beg.

Everything is clear, complex and full
of hurt that is adult, impossible
to soothe, although the gestures and the groans
bespeak an infant's needs. How little that I say
is necessary. How much less I try.

A woman enters, tall and grand, young
enough to know her looks will get her what
she wants. She will, I'm sure, walk out
at once, into another world, where beauty
strives to stay unmaimed. She will, at least,
have her cup across the street, away
from these, wholly content in their otherness.

Who barely know or care I'm here, inches
away, coffee gone, frantic markings
that scar the page. I stop to gaze at her --
beauty that stands her utterly apart --
while she, true to form, stares up and past,
ignoring my glance, and seats herself nearby.

A feeble cry, a bold decisive forearm
swat, she grapples with the smoky air,
hails her tribe, affirms their wordless rampart.

                I've heard this is how all stories end:
                a guy drives home through the snow
                while the woman dances in a bar. His car
                has one headlight
			  and a heater with a tickle
			  in its throat. This doesn't have to be
                a story about loss or love. We've all heard
                about the boy who saves a snowball
                in a freezer until school's out and summer
                cracks its knuckles one finger at a time;
                how he removes it with wool gloves and an opportunity
                for revenge. He misses his target:
                the classmate who teased his lisp,
                and his planning becomes cobwebs of snow
                in the wake of a passing truck.
                Love exists of its own reticence and
                memory too. I once loved a woman in winter,
                the first snowfall of inches we wrestled
                in the powder, cold moisture skiing beneath our clothes
                until the streetlights exhaled their breathy light
                and neighbors stretched their necks past window curtains
                to witness her snowball kiss my face. Sometimes
                I can still feel the burning welt of ice
                rubbing my cheek. At the end of Modern Times
                the Tramp and the Gamin walk along a road
                until they become silhouette--faceless, nameless,
                you, me. This must be a function of remembering.
                The first grade girl a six year old longed to hit
                with a snowball in July grew into a teen he desired
                and she sprouted up again like a storm front as he knelt
                by his mother's grave in late November
                forty years later. A galaxy of flurries
                falling from the garden of sky. The bar bands
                might jam all night, and the woman will keep
                dancing dancing		dancing while I try to decide
                between a U-turn and the drive home.
                Again, an evening of snow, the roads slick
                as a seducer, slick as the hair of my early teens.
                Tonight I read Gerald Stem while my speakers pulsate with the bass
                of Steel Pulse, and all I want is a plane ticket or a car that can make it
                all the years back to my adolescence. Maybe
                I'll hitchhike: drop me off in Greenwich Village
                or by Madison Square Garden, I'll walk the rest--
                I've done it before: December nights,
                snow melting into rain at the roofs, the buildings
                becoming walls of a wind tunnel for the wailing bay winds
                by the Battery. I've seen skyscrapers sway during storms
                reminding me the world spins. I saw a grown man
                cry and kick at the thick air while cursing the breeze
                that kited his cardboard protection among the pigeons.
                I remember--it was 1984 and I wanted to put my hands
                on his shoulders, say sentences full of consolation
                and understanding, and maybe give him some dollars
                or my hat. I wanted to... now it seems so futile;
                now I can pity my inability to help him;
                now I can think only of the pigeons of that city
                so different from the pigeons of Kalamazoo
                or Chicago or Detroit. On the streets of New York
                in the tiny parks and squares where old Jewish men
                and old Italian men play chess, on the rooftops of offices and brownstones,
                amputee pigeons squander their months, hobbling
                one footed and broken winged; the beheaded bird at the ferry terminal....
                Back then the way its body still rocked and pitched
                on its claws fascinated me, and I stood transfixed,
                curious because energy can't be created
                or destroyed so where did the charges locked between the synapses
                of that bird'snerves escape to? No one knows.
                That was April, 1984;
                that was the year my mother wrote her children's book,
 Petey the Pigeon--who had one foot and lived
                in the ferry terminal, the year the body of a jumper
                landed inches from my big toe. That was the year
                I loved Sherrie from Negril and learned
                her brother wanted to break my neck because I was white
                or punk rock or for no reason. That year Steel Pulse
                vibrated the Beacon Theatre, Peter Tosh skanked on stage
                at Radio City and I wrote poems for girls in school,
                took them to concerts and tried to seduce them later and failed
                or succeeded, I can't recall. That was the year my last umbrella
                whipped inside out so I flipped it in a garbage can
                and chose to ignore the Jamaican and Korean sidewalk salesmen,
                chose to ignore them for good,
                chose for the wings of precipitation to strike me
                as they fell, failing to defy the gravity of the world.
                On the bus stop where I once stood
                daily, I notice the exercise place
                has closed; no longer
                can I watch women in tights
                shimmering jello-like in its windows
                one flight up. I don't mind. Heading
                uptown to meet a bus that'll never come,
                I walk back the calendar to days I could watch a woman
                each morning, workbound
                and was unable to say anything
                about wanting: my words were buried
                in the sand of my throat as my pick-up lines crashed
                against beach-wall teeth.  I can see these strangers more clearly
                than girls I dated. And isn't doting
                over women I desired and never took out
                somehow American in the same way
                the boy who tugs his mom by the hand,
                finger-pointing through a department store
                after Christmas is American. And my father's father
                coming to this country from Italy
                discovered the streets weren't paved with gold, weren't
                paved at all, and, as an immigrant,
                he was expected to lay asphalt over cobblestones.
                His disappointment and his willingness
                to work were also American. His dreams
                were bags full of Coney Island and the Brooklyn Bridge.
                Here, in that city where I no longer live,
                I've learned the stores I shopped, the clubs,
                the old acquaintances, the women
                I loved or didn't love and wished I had
                are gone, and the gap their absence creates
                can't be stuffed with letters, photos,
                phone calls. I march streets of strange landmarks;
                my memories make turns: years pass as storefronts
                and when I choose to forget the bus,
                wedge my way through vacationers and business throngs,
                I see two women in a boutique's window
                changing a mannequin's clothes: cotton pastels
                despite the January date.
                That five year old, having unwrapped
                the new year begins writing a list of birthday wants
                four months away. It's made of race cars
                and electric trains like the set my grandfather gave me
                which never worked
                which rusted in the corner as I played
                with dolls, holding each fate that may have been.
                Forgive me, I was only learning
                the lives I might live.
So I took her to the river.
                We strolled west along Christopher Street
                beyond the brownstones and sex shops and piano bars
                where drag queens sang torches that weren't for she or me.
                Beyond even the West Side Highway we walked
                onto a concrete pier that stretched like her boyfriend's accusatory finger
                over the Hudson, and the lights of New Jersey
                burned low one at a time, so that the other couples who held hands
                like drowning men, recognizing their despair
                without comprehending it, they seemed larger, darker.
                We clutched each other closer
                and tried guessing which window in one of those buildings
                would go out last. When neither of us were right
                we laughed, and that laughter pulled us tight
                and the sound of our clothes rubbing seemed loud as a car wreck
                but there were no cars
                nor a moon
                incessant, incensed by a scow moving its cargo of refuse;
                only our tongues and a desire we couldn't refuse.
                only wavelike ripples rapping the pier,
                It was the feast of Saint James
                and I could hear the ancient bell of a neighborhood church,
                cranky as a crone; she led me from the water
                past the brownstones and the piano bars and the all-night cafes
                where oldermen seduced young women or young men
                depending on their fancy; she led me, both of us young
                and full of chance, up the stairs of a walk-up to the roof
                where I took off my boots. She took of her dress.
                I removed my belt and watched the glow of a street lamp
                rise above the edge of the roof. In that light her hair became a thunderstorm
                and we felt like rain. I could hear the church bells barking like market sellers,
                and I knew of her boyfriend whom she'd call tomorrow.
                I knew too that I didn't love her
                despite the lightning, despite even this poem.
                From that roof I could have seen that pier and its fistful of lovers
                and the Hudson with its barges and garbage scows.
                In New Jersey one lit window in a building dim with contentment.
                Like platelets the road crews ride the avenues;
                truck backs open, they sporadically stop
                to scab a pothole with hot asphalt and back up
                traffic for five minutes--
                				    one guy sliding from the cab,
                cigarette between pinky and ring finger,
                a shovel pivoting in the other hand.
                Scoop   Drop   Pat   Scoop   Drop   Pat Pat Pat
                Such a simple process.

                Two or three decades back and still in some films
                convicts did this work, but since Checkered Cabs closed
                and with the paper mills slowly donating
                less and less saw dust to the sky, it's become a wage,
                a way to buy another pack of Marlboro Reds
                and another Bic the last one lost a couple miles back.

                Why do thirty degrees in April seem warmer
                than the same thirty degrees in February?

                Every love I've lost I lost in spring
                or in some bar or classroom.

                Scars on my back from passion scratches,
                scars on my arm from knife wishes, the white line
                along the back of my hand where I slalomed
                a razor between hairs
                and spent the next seven minutes watching blood clot--

                I can't imagine anymore the soldier's life
                I once wanted, can't imagine the boredom of waiting
                for action, the cold nights of bunkers
                wanting only to smell the flowers of home: pansies
                and creeping phlox which might, just now, be blossoming.

                Early April and I'm still impatient;
                waiting for a day not impregnated with mow, a day
                when I'm able to take Alex to Milham Park
                for more than half an hour.
                                             Only last February I watched a man
                standing at the rim of ice before the warming mud
                of the playground. His daughter swung oblivious
                to anything but the sun which held her hand
                like she wished he would.
                And oblivious to even this wish.
                                                  That year winter left early,
                an insulted dinner guest no one missed,
                and that man stood there, grateful
                he wouldn't be called to salt the roads that night
                while the cigarette burned like the desire to be nothing
                like his father.

                What I think about now:
                                         slam dancing those nights
                when 300 of us massed in the pit our bodies red
                and ripe with adrenalin and three chord guitars by bands of initials:
                X, DOA, TSOL.
                               The old Rock Hotel on Jane Street
                right by the Hudson and the drag bars. I once rented a room
                four flights above the stage
                and spent the night staring at the shadowy barges on the river
                while cockroaches played fag in the bathroom
                and a young woman lay passed-out on the thin mattress.

                When she woke the next morning she asked if we--
                before she finished but
                said nothing because I had wanted to.
                That night was the last night of shows at the Rock Hotel
                although we didn't know it then. Some neighborhood group
                closed it down with complaints
                about the proliferation of graffiti on nights bands played:
                I shook my head
                spray paint cancer of New York Hardcore and
 Black Flag and illegibility--a pseudonym,
                a chance at immortality.

                The lattice work of cracks on a windshield
                --a shard of gravel jumped from a road crew truck
                then bounced
                             and bounced again onto the car hood
                before mating with the glass, an embryo for the shoots
                like the body of a crushed roach, its eight legs sprawled
                or a band's atlas-the towns of its tours
                moored to its home city by lines of black ink.

                Out of town the silos have all shrunk:
                                                       grain levels lower this April
                than history. On the road shoulders

                possum corpses, raccoon pelts, sometimes a house pet or strayand always
                the puddle of dry blood.
                Some days road crews come and pull these
                from the highways, other days a group of boys
                too old to play war
                                    too young for bars
                take them, shoving all that matted fur into a brown paper bag.

                And later, for fun they'll throw the body back and forth
                in their school's parking lot
                or in the long cool field of a city park.

                Thaw:
                the time of year for construction
                and destruction. In Kalamazoo three buildings
                are going down.
                                 The crews don't use dynamite
                or a wrecking ball like the crowd anticipates, but

                the way steam shovels and bulldozers attack
                makes it more melodramatic--
                                            with every hit rises a geyser of dust.
                Did the Rock Hotel go down this way?

                My last visit driving the West Side I saw
                only a vacant lot in its place. I had to pull over
                and walk Jane Street again. It was only then I noticed
                the spray paint fading with age on neighboring walls;
                a galaxy of phlox and mums straining in the filled-in foundation.
                Despite seeing them all my life, I couldn't recognize my fingerprints
                if you carried their whorls and swirls to me
                having found them on a glass or on a woman's body.
                I'd have to believe their cursive signature,
                finger the ridges I've touched all these years and try to decipher
                their script

                             like the psychic I visited
                who grasped my wrist and fingered the lines of my palm
                annotating a stranger's biography. He had me ringered for a painter,
                said I suffered some blow to the ego, believed I should work
                with my hands seeing an absence
                of calluses and blisters. Remember the lemon juice writing
                I learned in fifth grade magic books
                or the black light ink some clubs use
                or the braille typewriter in the library where I worked--
                how I could never read its pellets scattershot in lines on the page.
                I can't reclaim what else he said
                so contained was I by thoughts
                about the signs we carry in our pockets or might see in the sky.
                Was he right?

                Three years later it seems insignificant
                or indistinguishable as braille pages held at arm's length.
                Perhaps Garcia Lorca could tell me if the gypsies really know,
                but Garcia Lorca's dead,
                and no one foresaw the revolution, his murder,
                and the wind above his grave is dry and quiet
                as the wind running the streets of Kalamazoo
                or the streets of Staten Island.
                                                  The wind always wordless.
                The wind.

                          I've heard a woman once heard voices in the wind
                and tried locking it outside, stuffing old underwear
                into the cracks of the doors and around windows.
                For nights her fifties stereo rattled the house with song.
                Then silence. Neighbors began to miss her

                standing among the weedy lawn; all the curtains now shut,
                they couldn't see the platoon of cats
                she barracked.  Finally some teenage boys found courage....
                The smell in the foyer: cat dung and something staler,
                more pungent. They'd never smelled decay before.

                That was on Ross Street by the store where I bought comics;
                the cops came, the paramedics;
                the photographers from the papers flashed her walls of red paint words
                and paperboys delivered them to the neighborhood
                with daily installments of her diary entrees: cats and nonsense words.

                Whether these stories were true I'll never know---
                so many unanswerable questions. I know friends
                who can go to sleep with a stray inquiry roaming the alleys of consciousness
                and wake to it tamed by an answer. I knew the definitions
                to the scrawled glyphs on handball courts and subway walls
                Now the language has changed. I believe some people
                can read cards, I believe some people know the dialects
                of the dead, the statements backwards masked on old L.P.s,
                the tongue of the breeze which even now howls

                through my driveway, its volume loud
                trying to make itself understood.
                I believe in the curse of 1940.
                I believe in the stone stumbled over that starts a streak of bad luck,
                how we try to trace our days back to it, following
                our misfortunes the way we might follow a spiral of crows
                down to the corpse of a small doe at roadside. And my brother

                can't watch a Ranger game anymore
                without wearing a fifteen year oldjersey, its tattered stairwell of letters
                up the front now dull, the once royal blue more peasant-colored,
                washed out

                like the face of a young woman who's been crying off and on
                for the last forty-eight hours. Her boyfriend stole her checkbook
                and credit cards while leaving his identity behind.
                She's so embarrassed
                that She's called no one but her mother and the police

                answering their inquiries with yes or no and sometimes
                only shaking her head. When the phone rings
                she crosses herself and the seconds before she lifts the handset
                from its cradle become an interval of hope.

                Then time goes awry,
                and the moment between the first trill of the phone
                and the next is room enough
                for their seven month relationship:
                their initial meeting in a laundromat one block
                from where she now stands, then how she sawhim again
                at the newsstand in the building where she works. He asked her name,
                offered to pay for the paper, and finally
                mentioned dinner. He was a restaurant critic


                so their meals were free
                although now she can't recall ever seeing his name
                in print. She suddenly realized he never paid for anything.
                Anything.


                Tomorrow she'll call the papers in town....

                What we discuss when we discuss luck--

                how my family divvied dollars among the lotteries but me; I looked, instead,
 to get lucky, smoked Lucky Strikes and stubbed my cigarettes silent
                then relit them to please the divine: a sacrifice
                a ritual of singles bars and punk bands. Why? I can't say,
                but my mother keeps playing birthdays and anniversaries
                for the lotto, Michael still hand-washes that shirt after each loss,
                as if detergent could remove such a stain.

 You don't understand, I saw thirteen games in 79 wearing thisjersey, and they didn lose
                one. They tied two. They made it to the finals.  I know it crazy to believe,
                but you don't understand.

                But I do.

                as does that woman who, up late, has stopped sobbing and regained
                her wonderment with the world. On the news
                the sportscaster flirts with her
                as he scrolls through the scores,a roll call of leagues
                and seasons, all this time freeing memories because he didn't like sports.
                She becomes a tomboy again. She's able then

                to appreciate her mother's support, and can hear her mom
                cluttering the kitchen with sound. Distraction and distance must
                be close: all this action helps her forget.

                Then the phone rings again.

                                          ~

                The miles home become months of my life,
                become nothing. Along the highway, raptors traipse skyward as I approach,
                singing their chorale of caws and complaints.

                Sometimes I make each traffic light
                right before it blinks red or as it just shines green, so I never have to brake.
                Such days I know my fortune's good--

                I could talk my way out of a traffic ticket,
                find a ten spot in a pocket or in the parking lot--

                but tonight the signals all wink their yellow eyes,
                letting me know my home will roar hollow with a televised crowd eight hundred miles away
                and I have no jersey to wear, no protection whatsoever.
                I draw hard on my cigarette and ash it out.

                Light it again.

                In her apartment of noises that woman crosses herself as the telephone sounds.

                We do these things for luck.
                My son loves me.
                An address book full of friends
                and lovers who some nights call my name.

                A few Fridays each year I suffer
                through bad hands of seven card stud, the freak
                four kings that demolish my full house,
                and I shake my head later in the rear-view mirror.
                Would I be happier if I won?

                No. I long for the unmitigated grace
                of the squirrell balancing on the phone wire
                or on the thinnest branch of the backyard sycamore.
                Now I want the ease of that branch’s sinewy movements
                in the easterly breeze of evening.

                No; I want nothing less
                than to be that wind, empty and entirely of the world.
                What it had to be like: Shackleton and two of his crew
                facing the glaciers, the crust cracking
                beneath each step, the gale's mouth spitting
                a spackle of sleet and hail. Fifty feet of rope

                tethers them together. They've driven screws
                through the soles of their boots, makeshift cleats
                No maps. No paths. Only duty, a fine drape of snow
                and South Georgia's alpine geography.

                Hungry and hallucinatory, they know they're the only hope
                for twenty-two crewmates marooned and counting
                penguins on another stony island: they must continue,
                Shackleton leading until he steps into the limbo of air

                beneath a sidewalk of ice. If the world is similar
                to cartoons, he may have hung there a minute
                in mid-air, spinning in the grip of cold wind
                like a nine ball spinning in the space above the pocket

                before dropping.  The other two follow, dragged
                through twenty feet of air and prayers to mountain side
                on which they slide--a 900 foot toboggan ride,
                their ragged coats and pants their only sleds.

                As usual I've begun in the story's middle
                despite the new year and talk of new beginnings.

                Here, the heater stutters its one forgettable line
                and neither of us wants to walk to the car, storebound.
                The wind mutters like a young schizophrenic who would just as soon threaten
                as bless you with the mercy of his savior,
                but truly all he says is this is the coldest winter in history.

                On the west coast the fault line shimmies, and on the bible network
                another mouth of apocalypse
                reads the weather report of ages.

                The inexact sciences: physics, emotology, meteorology.
                How the innocent attempt of a penguin to fly
                influences rhe inflections of the wind a hemisphere away and the wave-size
                at the ocean's far shore. What I know

                This frost can slur the world's axial fluency,
                the traffic slows, honking the slush, and in frozen rivers
                ships mimic The Endurance
                barnacled by ice among the floes.

                1914. Antarctica
                Its crew works for warmth, daily shoveling ice
                from the hull; still, it creeps back each evening
                like a nightmare Shackleton brushes away
                harking orders or reciting Shelley, Byron, Keats

                ~

                and same days Dante to his men, the darkness now
                twenty hours long, so cold they almost expect shadows

                cast in the dim glimmers of the galley to freeze and the smoke
                climbing the ladder to heaven from the stove to get stuck

                somewhere above the rigging and the masts.
                Winter cast? its phenomena of cold; Shackleton records the past

                months in his journal. Soon they must abandon ship,
                the crew salvaging supplies, making camp on an ice slip

                surrounded by wreckage, dead seals, the Antarctic Circle.
                Worsley and Shackleton surveying this ghetto could well be Dante and Virgil

                at Circle Three. Months later, orders to trudge the slushing
                floes, their flotsam melting into the camp's ice, the men mushing

                the dogs that must someday become dinner, the sledges useless
                for pulling their salvaged boats--vessels of a fragile promise:

                rescue or at least dry land. They're heading: barren Elephant Island
                One hundred miles due north. Thirst their biggest threat and water all around.

                Perhaps what they missed the most:
                the swell of a woman's breast in winter,
                her skin almost colorless hut for the shade of her bodice.
                It's at this moment need and desire blur,

                an hallucination of want made real by the two of us.
                How easy it is in the solitary confinement
                of ego to lust, how easy to forget
                pain and tenderness and the temptation

                of the blood.  But outside the pulse of the wind
                rushes, adrenalized and loaded with lymphocytes of snow.
                If we were other people or younger we might
                drop in the drifts, side-by-side

                and leave in our wake the hollow shell of angels.
                Instead we do nothing. The civilized world glows
                saffron on either side of the street, and one of those lights
                sneaks inside to throw our mortal silhouettes on the wall.
                Last year a youngman forgot to look both ways
                when shortcutting down the ravine and across the tracks
                and he was smacked by a train
                although I don't believe an Amtrack could actually sneak up
                on anybody. I wonder what he thought the tremor
                of the rails was; the steady clack of those four cars

                might have become the whirr of a june bug
                strafing the roof of a childhood porch
                and amplified by years and a phobia. The one he recalled
                flew big as an ear
                and he stood there for only a second
                loking at the bug light which soon became the sole eye
                of a diesel engine, and he survived.

                And nine years ago I might have stood one footed at the sight
                of a rat on a subway platform, could hear more of them chattering
                late nights after CBGBor the Mudd Club
                waiting for the six train below Bleecker Street.
                And when it arrived, Mark and I would scan the cars
                for our graffiti; perhaps he'd produce four colors
                from his knapsack, and we'd paint our tags through the tunnels,
                one of us checking for transit cops.

                That time he tried to cheat a fare at Twenty-third Street
                we were both chased
                until there was nowhere else to go but down
                so we did. The dark air around us
                hummed electric, and the occasional express
                fumed sparks as it passed, lighting our way
                for a moment. Then I tripped

                and in a second of instinct I tried to grip
                the third rail to break my fall.
                I failed, spraining my ankle on a cross tie.
                With me crippled the rest of the way, we'd never make it
                to the next station seven blocks South
                before the next local accosted us.

                All the emergency exit Signs died of loneliness.

                That day we discovered the Eighteenth Street station,
                long abandoned to the homeless and the few teens
                who thought it was a great place to bring a girl
                or a dime bag. While the next train chanted by,
                I sat with Mark, both of us panting, our hearts
                restless birds beneath our rib cages.
                If this is the only foolish thing I've done, I'm blessed,

                but even Christine who tunes her mandolin in the next room
                knows it's not, tallies my mistakes and misdemeanors
                in a notebook and reminds me of them when we fight.
                I try to understand this as I understand why Mark
                didn't part with a buck of lunch that November afternoon
                why that kid paused

                atop those rattling tracks,and why we have totake
                the shortcuts sometimes, despite the danger,
                despite the voice within us saying, There a safe route, please take it:

                we got to test the angels that save us.
                I can't see them behind me though,
                see only the sparks of iron wheels against rails
                burning the dark air briefly.
                His cobwebbed face exhales and cumulus
                puffs of carbon dioxide explode in silence
                within the arms of arctic winds. He stands

                still, head raised, gazing for the Northern Lights
                tattooed on the February sky. A few years back
                he might have counted the constellations, recognizing them

                on his fingers, Orion, Draco, Ursa Minor....
                Last night the swollen moon burned sullen,
                painted shadows on the street dark and long as if

                it were morning, and he stared at the black form
                unfurling from his toes onto the fading asphalt.
                It's name sat at the edge of his tongue

                like the name of another who's long gone
                and whom he imagines he saw one day among the faces of pedestrians
                in a crosswalk far from this suburb of cyclone fences

                and pedigreed dogs. Tonight, those names
                are pointless; the hypnotist wind beckons him,
 Forget.... There's a treasure buried above the clouds--

                he can still envision the almanac pages for today
                even if he's surrendered the titles of the stars
                their fanciful rage, even if his shadow has left him

                there's still this curb, his house behind him
                with its windows lit by end-table lamps, the photo albums
                beneath them suffering their comas of disinterest. Rings of breath

                stagger from his mouth and dance the stage
                of atmosphere below the streetlamps.  He can almost see
                a name spelled as he exhales,

                he can almost hear it whispered into his ear,
                the cool tongue of wind licking his lobe.
                The breaths rise into the dark sky
                                                   then dissolve.              
                That year, the city finally silenced
                my adolescence by downing the power to stages
                all over New York. The clubs darkened, and bands
                parked their vans in front of rehearsal spaces and allowed them
                to rust away or be stripped by vandals. That year

                I squandered hours befriending whiskey sours and imported cigarettes
                at the Cherry Tavern with its jukebox of Jamaican reggae and ska,
                and its dollar-a-rack bar table--a thin green sheet of felt
                stretched transparent atop potholed slate.
                My faith in fate can be traced to that table
                and the eightball I bet my wages on there; the dates I met there
                after signing out.
                                   How I slipped the silver moon of a quarter
                into the juke and called forth 165-the sole record
                with a scratch, entrapping the bar crowd
                in the same three chords until someone kicked the machine, frustrated.

                Was it me?
                           I think it was
                                          the night Laura stoodme up. I think
                it was the night my angles weren't right,
                and twice the eight ball balked at my orders,
                my cue rebelled and stole the fold of bills from my wallet,
                dispersed it among my opponents and the waitress, a veritable car bomb
                of generosity. There's a ferocity in fortune turning its back to you
                a rage so great you have little

                but the echo of your own footfalls in the hollow
                canyon of a Lower East Side street, in the cantankerous fluorescence
                of your building's corridors. Oh spirit-who-flips-the-coin of chance
                and skill, of love and disappointment,

                I lit the novena of my cigarettes for you, sitting on a fire escape
                following the movement of gulls above the East River
                as they fell toward the grey canopy of water, cawing with vigor
                and summer lust, the heat rising from Manhattan
                                                           splaying their gray feathers
                and holding them aloft.

                                       No signs. No phone calls bold with apologies
                or explanations. Nothing but a crumple of bills
                left on an end table,
                and the crooked legs of stubbed out butts
                in an ashtray. Not even a band to play
                one song to give me back that youth.
                At seven when I moved to a block full of Irish
                and Italians, their houses brilliant with middle classness,
                brilliant with basketball hoops and swimming pools,
                I wanted what mom couldn't give, and who doesn't want
                what's out of his grasp--Tommy Tierney, the Crupi brothers, Trisha McKeever
                I laughed at their Polish jokes and Black jokes
                and my Eastern European roots
                and the Jamaican friends of my old neighborhood,
                I just forgot.

                ~

                               I saw a UFO once. I remember it.
                I sat on a parked Volvo, avoiding our empty living room;
                late Saturday night, no babysitter;
                I was nine, and above the woods up the block
                a flat green strip of neon like a wayward bar sign
                hovered, and I stood on that car's hood to get a better look.
                Then I ran to get binoculars,
                but when I returned it rocketed heavenward while I remained,
                shaking because I believed I saw it, just like I believe
                an angel fluttered in my Chevy once

                when it rode a flying carpet of ice through an intersection.
                I just watched the woman's face in the approaching car
                as it changed from singing along to astonishment
                and then shock at impact. My body tried to escape
                the seat belt, and my head pivoted--something small and white
                flipped in the air. I know it was a styrofoam coffee cup
                somersaulting, acrobatic and hot,
                but at that moment, adrenalin erupting into my blood,

                it seemed alien, it seemed too graceful;
                it seemed personal, protective, judgmental.

                ~

                To count my sins should I begin with the skin's
                or the spirit's? with abundance or want?

                In the cemetery around the corner lay my mother's father,
                and in its courtyard we played baseball,
                the Crupi brothers always captains. One afternoon I stayed with their sister;
                she dared me to kiss her breasts.
                Sweat abandoned my nine year old body;
                as she brought my head to her tits I kissed them chastely,
                mouth unopen until my penis stirred its preadolescent smallness,
                and she squeezed....

                                     That night I moved among the mausoleums,
                restless and rustled with lust so even the sculptured Mary,
                granite white in the moonlight, was sexy.

                The cemetery I haven't mentioned
                buried only blacks, lay buried for the neighborhood kids:
                the secrecy of prejudice. Tommy always rattled the phlegm
                in his throat when we scuttled by a Black man on the streets,
                one of the others might've muttered, Nigger or Afroturf
                an old joke, so everyone would laugh
                and I wouldn't look at the passing man
                out of embarrassment.
                One morning we saw a hearse followed by its battalion of mourners,
                mostly Caddies or jalopies, motor into the Frederick Douglass Memorial,
                and we decided to spy, struggling through the wrought iron,
                down low behind headstones and statues until we were close
                to the pit, close enough to see the family,
                a handful of whites among them, close enough to see no one

                wept as the reverend spoke in a voice soft as siren lights.
                Then everyone sang, and it shocked us,
                this collective voice of love for life; I leaned closer still and noticed
                a girl my age, her skin the color of the overturned autumn earth,
                her eyes spotlighting the entire cemetery
                until someone behind me summoned up spit, someone else sniggered
                but before anything could be spoken or done, I hissed, No, she's beautiful
                or wished I had because nothing mattered

                but the girl, the marble angel looming above us,
                and that song ascending from our grief.
                I believe the world is small. Look
                the stone I just kicked down this street
                has gotten further in its journey;
                before this it was pulled down the road
                by the skid of a car
                and earlier brought by dump truck from a foundry.
                It jumped off here, in Constock, by either bump
                or its own gravel volition.

                There must be another guy my age
                kicking stones in his path even as I write this.
                This poem is for him
                and the person he loves who isn't
                with him. He might be anywhere

                on either coast. Overlooking the Pacific
                a young woman putters in her kitchen.  In New York
                my mother shifts her typewriter to capitals one more time.
                I want to hug them both but can't:
                no matter how small I believe the world to be
                I'm smaller, and even the extensions of telephones
                makes them impossible, at times, to hold.

                Last time I was in New York, Kermit and I laughed memory
                and college stories until I missed him
                and missed all the names we mentioned.

                This poem is for everyone I've loved.
                This poem is for no one.

                It's for the teenage boy who washes cars
                each day for a Dodge dealership in Akron, Ohio;
                he walks along a state road for half a mile
                to work and kicks the loose stones sometimes.

                Listen, gravel scatters on the surface of the small world.
                The ghost of my adolescence dyed
                his hair blue and grew it long and heavy.
                He hovered by the garbage cans, scavenging
                like my mother's insane brother
                who picks through dumpsters for stale bagels,
                who stole into my father's office years ago
                asking cash and later tried
                to set the building on fire with a mouthful of gasoline
                syphoned from a United Parcel truck.

                I saw the ghost of my adolescence pissing in an alley
                off Grove St.  I didn't think he saw me.
                He pissed, zipped up and disappeared into the darkness
                down the way, maybe looking for the Rastaman to score
                coke. Later, I heard him laughing
                with a brunette girl I'd never seen before;
                when they surfaced in the orange aura of New York nights
                --his arm around her shoulders, hers a python
                at his waist-they whispered to each other
                and kept laughing. It shocked me, such intimacy.

                I heard him again beyond the window separating a friend's place
                from the persistent conversation of Seventh Avenue.
                She and I'd been lovers once, five years before,
                but that night we lay on her mattress fully-dressed,
                and as she papered the walls with wants and mistakes,
                I stared at the book titles on her shelves
                until they became headlines or bold new constellations
                of letter-stars. I believe that ghost wanted me
                to want her again as it watched through the glass,
                squatting recklessly on the fire escape,

                but in the end she and I just lay there
                in the memory of our own respiration until she moaned in the voice
                of that ghost, possessed by what I used to be,
                what we used to be: this city, 1985.
                And if I believed we could converse then, this ghost of me
                and me, I might have asked how I could free it
                from this island, from sanding the floor of a boarded up brownstone
                each night as he trespassed and slept on East Fourth Street.  We said nothing.

                The blue and red tears of an ambulance entered the room,
                high-lighting the biographical spines of fascists
                in its glow; below, a radio danced its hip-hop,
                and when this passed we heard only the whispered sentences of traffic,
                her breathing, mine.

                Then the clatter of the ladder
                falling to cement, a tympani of garbage cans:
                the ghost of my adolescence sprinting,
                each square of the sidewalk another calendar day backward,
                the stars rattling in the wake of the spirit's exhaust.
                The way the stray fragments of asphalt ice
                grasp the filaments of street lights
                as if they were the only means of preventing thaw

                might well be the emberous tip of a birthday
                candle's wick after the wishing and the breathy push
                of hope. On my sixteenth birthday I pocketed

                my hands and desires and dined alone. I didn't feel young
                or old; I felt just the dull pulse of adolescence
                which beat its drum like a shaman in the distant

                prairie of my unconscious. Later, I followed
                taxis by foot and when I lost one to velocity or traffic,
                I chose another, and in this way I unwrapped the neighborhoods

                of Manhattan, one unfamiliar block at a time,
                rows of shops darkened with steel grates and early hours,
                stunted saplings bent under night's dark thumb.

                And the people--a beat cop, a woman walking
                her Golden Retriever, a couple holding their bodies closer
                than usual. It was a cool evening for August and the earth

                already lusted autumn's erotic touch.
                No, I didn't feel lonely or sad
                but I believe I might have said something about melancholy

                which means I lied or didn't understand,
                which means, really, that I hefted an adolescence
                similar to millions in this America, where the ice currently

                is abundant but melting, where a young girl
                struggles above the sixty-fourblack-or-white squares
                of a chessboard before deciding to move her rook,

                the piece she believes looks like an ashtray.
                She has no opponent. She sits
                with a strategy book, its spine broken

                so the cover remains forever open in mute surprise
                or indifference. Some people might call her attractive,
                even lovely. If there are spirits that watch over

                the young they must blink their eyes rapidly in the night sky
                and repeatedly. They've been spying us for millennia
                and witnessed this world when it still lay shrouded

                by clouds and dust. They don't tell us this. They don't whisper
                to that girl, push the pawn.  No, their voices are more quiet
                than a windless day on an abandoned blueberry farm where I dreamt

                I stood: the black sky a chalkboard for lessons
                I forfeited when I turned away to face the silent flatlands
                and the column of flailing red lights atop a distant radio tower

                on the dusty horizon, warning airplanes away
                and letting me know other people were out there,
                waiting at home, tuned in, and wanting for news.      
                As sea water freezes, the salt flees
                erecting itself a ladder toward some unseen landing,
                seven or seventeen feet above the impatient ice.
                Angels might climb to it. In the fading sunlight
                of a two hour day, you can see them through the scaffolding of snow,
                pirouetting and coiling on those saline sculptures,
                                                             Jacob's dream gone awry.

                ~

                The first sprig of spring-like weather
                and I'm tethered to IV tubing, a new scar
                extending across my abdomen like an unfinished turnpike
                through the hills and curves of flesh. Outside, the main drag

                unspools like a long grey scarf a child dropped
                and I watch it spill beneath a rag of cold in the distance. The traffic flashes
                its gold teeth in the sun of its business while I whittle
                hours into syllables until little by little time regains definition.

                ~

                And in the mirror at night
                I see a younger me, one who doesn't want
                to look me in the eye, a spiked prairie of hair
                all he'll show.

                                The reluctance of nostalgia or regret--
                I think of Jo who wore one of these green backless gowns
                just four months ago, how the nurses searched to find a vein

                sturdy enough to support a needle, the nourishment of tubes. By the end
                she must've been straw frail, pale as that nurse's skirt
                but stained with scabs and lesions.

                Jo who fired artillery with her eyes
                armed with desire, her pink hair like a struck flare
                in the strobes and floodlights of the Mudd Club,
                gorgeous but for the garden of violets that blossomed on the stems of her arteries,
                the needles she kept taped to a looseleaf binder.

                Had I known, nothing would differ.
                Had I returned and learned she was renting a bed
                at St. Vincent's, her only conversation the IV pump's hum
                and the old community volunteers with spun sugar hair, I would have visited,
                the whole time thankful with guilt that we hadn't fulfilled our adolescent lust.
                But no, just a phone call late,
                a remnant's voice muddy with long distance lines saying only pneumonia and services.
                What went unsaid was a wind from the Northwest Territories.


                Outside the snow falling like angel suicides.

                ~

                If it's true--no two snowflakes are alike
                and the helix of DNA forbids the duplication of fingerprints
                then no reflection in a mirror can truly be me.

                I saw a young girl lying in a backyard, her legs
                spreading, then closing, arms arcing
                                                     overhead before sledding back to her sides.
                She did this a dozen times, imprinting a platoon of angels--
                no two of them identical
                but close enough for her human eyes.

                An hour later how she's changed,
                unaware of the chapped skin of her cheeks and fingers
                as she stares from her window, those figures glowing in the porchlight's glare.
                And although she believes them perfect, she won't recall them

                twenty years hence, won't even notice
                the impression she leaves on the sheets of a lover's bed.

                ~

                53 Degrees.
                             76 Degrees more than a morning only a month ago.
                On a day like today I first saw Lake Michigan gyrating its hips,
                the force of melting ice a kind of intercourse
                between the seasons, and I saw water and frost to the earth's curve; that's all.
                The scent of sand, the breath of fresh water, the sweat
                of my own weakness rising.

                And Grand Haven's great concrete piers vibrated in the waves,
                like blaming fingers toward Illinois
                while the one light house erect, watchful,
                and obsolete, stood firm--perfect for postcards and photos
                in the manner of lighthouses seeded along the Eastern Seaboard
                and the Pacific Shorefront. Still

                water is different from other water; no two bodies the same--
                
~

                I only kissed Jo once.
                                      Tompkins Square Park. Early Spring.
                The drums of handball games a few yards away--
                four rubber balls meeting a concrete wall rapidly
                and out-of-rhythm
                                --could've been my pulse.

                ~

                How long might one want for a body,
                years? decades even? Behindme there's just a series of calendar squares
                like a sidewalk I've traveled.

                The horizon all shadows and cumulonimbus like the abdomen of a procession.

                Even the best of men second-guesses himself. The prophets.
                Crane in the water, his lungs fighting, longing for the Lower East Side again,
                or Shackleton, below deck on the Endurance
                which lay shackled by ice to the Weddell Sea: did he wish the ship
 had been commissioned to beat the U-boats
                rather than this failed transantarctic trek.

                Spring in the Northern hemisphere, already winter
                by the South Pole, bay water freezing and the ice...

                A garden of gargantuan crystalline chrysanthemums.

                ~

                No, those salty growths from the ice floes
                aren't attractive: gray masses mostly, although when the crystals
                collect the doubled light of sun and sun-on-ice, even a place abandoned
                by grass, city lights, and lovers may seem full of grace.

                And as the silver shroud of evening gets pulled across the sky
                what an improbable museum those salt sculptures must make--
                a brigade of Lot's wives.
                                          Lot's wife
                whose only sin was looking back.

I have awakened her 
when the sky was at its blackest, 
all stars erased, no moon to speak of, 
and led her down the front path 
to our dock, where we'd swim to the raft, 
finding it by touch 
fifty or sixty strokes from shore. 

And sit 
listening to things, the movement of water 
around us drawing us closer, a hunched 
double knot of child and father 
hearing all there is to hear, 
close beneath bats who see without sight, 
whose hunger is fed by darkness. 

The neighbors see her often in the woods, 
on hands and knees, smoothing the moss 
where it spreads in the shade, marvelling 
at the tongues of birds, the stained petal 
of the dogwood, the vein of color 
skirting the edge of an upturned stone. 

This morning she awoke to the first flash 
of the magnolia, and will save the petals 
as they fall, their purpled lids 
curling white on the lawn. 

We meant to tell her how the rainbows come, 
how they close into shadows, 
how we would be there nonetheless; 
we meant to tell her before 
they arrived at supper this evening, 
rimming everything in sight.

She wonders if we see them 
cupping the stars, the kitchen lamp, 
each other's face, and we say 
we do.
The thud always awakens her 
where she sits at the living room window 
gathering a shawl tight at her neck, 
her fist a pale brooch, 
its veins hard and swollen. 

She has heard it every night 
since he went overseas: 
the muddy jeep backfiring at the curb, 
his flag-wrapped body bumping to the ground, 
stars flicking light on the hedges 
as he rolls toward the house. 


  Her cane finds the corner of things 
  and she makes her way to the veranda door, 
its screen speckled with bugs 
lured by the pantry light. 

At the top step 
she shakes her stick at the darkness 
and mutters a private curse; 
she leans on the railing and takes 
each step as it comes, swallowing 
quick gulps of air and straining 
to see the lawn. 

On down the walk she goes 
to the far side of the hedge 
where the streetlamp lumps its shadows 
on the leaves. 

She pokes at the bushes and calls him 
in the voice she used above his crib 
three wars ago, pleading for her bambino, 
expecting to see him young and warm 
in his bunting, longing 
to feed at her breast. 

She unbuttons herself to the waist 
and probes among the brush, 
disturbing nothing but a squirrel, 
stiff in the leaves, the mouth 
dried open in its fur.
He is barefoot in the creek again, 
wandering between his house and the next, 
not fully awake from dreams of grenades 
blown orange. 

Clad in summer pajamas, he fondles himself 
for slivers unable to rust as they rise 
from the streams of his flesh: grey hairs 
refusing to bend. 

He enters the tunnel beneath the road 
and squats there; the cannon of his voice, 
reaching both flanks, commands the neighborhood 
to take cover. 

There are no replies from the ranks; 
the years have covered them with grass grown wild 
in memory. 

His fingers continue their search, sensing movement 
within, and succeed at his left wrist 
where a steel pricker stands rigid 
-- a miniature soldier -- the point of its bayonet 
piercing the skin for escape. 

He draws at it with his teeth and feels it 
give way; with his prisoner pinched 
between finger and thumb, he crawls with the current 
toward light. 

Caught in the death of his squad, leaving 
only the moon as a guide, 
he questions his victim, frantic to learn 
the invasion plans of those left behind 
to drain his heart. 

In the blur of morning, he watches his enemy 
twist once before curling dead 
in the palm of his hand. 

Giving him now to the stream, using a leaf as a pallet, 
he kneels to the dead man's voyage.
Drawn by a distant warmth, 
the Monarch unfolds herself 
from the silk of her sleep 
and stumbles the length of a branch 
before learning to glide 
to the darkened window 
of a grey-stoned building 
silenced for the dying. 

Unaware of glass, 
she floats through it 
and settles on the gentle rise 
of a wrist where pale tubing 
weeps within a threadlike vein. 

Lashes flutter mildly like wings, 
and the butterfly goes to them, 
landing softly on the bridge 
of the nose. 

She discovers her own image 
reflected beneath the lid, 
and passes through the eye 
to find the soul's wick 
flickering in the last 
of its shadows. 

She fans the darkness into light; 
cold ashes whirl away to memory, 
and the tip of the child's tongue 
drifts like a leaf 
to taste the sweet dust of wings 
fallen iridescent on her lips.
I. CATHERINE ANNE HANLEY

They knew scarlet fever when they saw it, 
and they saw it on her neck and arms, 
could feel it in the pulse she gave off 
as she lay in fever on her bunk twisting 
the blanket to her face, a headache 
wishing her back to Dublin, to her own 
bed, her own window where the breeze 
brought the garden inside. 

In three days it would be her ears; 
in a week she would let go 
of her fourth winter, her parents' faces 
blurring away, her sisters' eyes turning 
into stars as she eased out of pain, 
wrapped in their blankets, surrounded 
by everything she'd touched, swirling 
with her in a weighted sack, to the floor 
of the Atlantic. 

II. JAMES EDWARD HANLEY

They were told to return to steerage 
where they belonged, but stayed, 
the father's eyes ending any argument 
on deck; a tanner by trade, his hands 
were mostly leather; the arms, massive 
as country fence posts, curved 
around his family bent at the railing 
in prayer. 

In time, they asked for more blankets 
and took the children below, 
where they lay broken in the first grief
they had ever known, their mother close 
to the father, speaking in whisper, 
learning again that his strength was only 
partly his own. 

III. LAURA MARIE HANLEY

The child's third night was fitful; at dawn 
she awoke in chill; by noon the headaches 
began, the spots scattered themselves, 
and the countrymen nearest her bunk 
turned their faces to the wall. 

They were five days from shore; the hospital 
could save her; fresh vegetables and milk 
would be waiting, clean linen and gargles, 
warm baths and oils when the peeling began; 
she was less frail than Catherine, older, 
and had never been sick before. 

IV. ELIZABETH CARROLL HANLEY

She would bring her daughter through; 
after eight weeks of living in stench, 
eating like beggars, sleeping in straw, 
they would be in America where Uncle Patrick 
held a parcel of land in their name. 

She would see to it that Laura Marie would be 
with them; she would wager her life on it; 
through day and night she stayed 
with the child, keeping the others away, 
restricting her diet to soft foods, listening 
to advice from the curious and bereaved 

Until her own eyes burned, even when shut; her throat 
closed beyond words, and she lay back 
on her bunk, rubbing away the strawberry rash 
that was forming on her arms. 

V. LIZA, MARY, AND KATE HANLEY

They stayed below with their father when the men 
took the others, the men in thick masks and gloves 
who said kind things to the stretchers they carried, 
and told James to come back in six weeks, that all 
would be fine by then. 

In three hours, they were on land, walking ahead 
of him, trying not to fall down in the crowd, 
feeling his hands urging them on, steering them 
wherever the signs told him to go, his voice 
telling them all the things they wanted to hear. 

A man with a badge gave them white cards to hang 
on their coats; their common code, Han-14, 
would get them together if lost; on to the end 
of the ramp where doctors worked in rooms 
with ceilings as far back as you could lean; a man 
just ahead had his card torn in half and chalk 
scrawled on his sleeve; they took him 
out a different door. 

They held hands outside and followed their father 
to the trains; once aboard, they felt sure of things 
and fell asleep, leaving him to watch the buildings 
give way to trees; by morning, they were there. 

VI. MRS. JAMES EDWARD HANLEY AND DAUGHTER

A prayerful six weeks passed slowly in the house 
in upstate New York, but the time came to bring 
the rest of his women home; he would travel alone, 
leaving Liza in charge, and Mary and Kate 
would obey her as they would their mother, 
or he would know the why of it. 

The trip to Ward's Island was long, but he ran 
the gravel road to the hospital, stopping 
out of breath at the desk to be told 
the third floor office would have that sort 
of information; it did: 

Two entries. December, 1850, six days apart: 

                Cremated due to contagion 
          Elizabeth Hanley, age thirty-four 
          Laura Marie Hanley, age six 

The road to the depot was spotted with snow, 
his hands raw where he wrung them, each knuckle 
white at the bone. 

The last car was empty, its windows heavy with soot; 
he saw trees hardened with ice, and a sky going grey 
without clouds. He pulled the shade to the sill.
He'd learned to survive, 
but lately had taken to staying on 
after his nightly novenas, 
to kneel slouched in the front pew 
to stare up at the dead man 
screwed to the windowed wall 
and think fondly of the grave. 

He half-expected the body to move, 
the flick of an eyelid, 
a twitching thumb, a groan 
rising from the throat, maybe 
even a word, his name, something, 
anything he could hang on to. 

They took him that way; 
before he woke from his trance 
they were peeling off his socks 
for a black wad to jam in his mouth; 
he felt his shoes dangling 
around his neck; saw his undershorts 
soggy in the baptismal font, 
his cassock a costume for the one 
called Sonny, the soutane sleeves 
flapping as he whirled away 
to the loft to slash the bell-rope 
and watch it fall: a stricken snake 
coiling on the wooden floor. 

They cracked him to his knees 
and bound his wrists behind him, 
lashing them hard against his feet, 
causing old prayers to form on his lips 
to be knocked away by fists 
pulling steady on the rope they'd hurled 
over the center beam.

And up he rose to the plaster face 
where they left him upside down 
to circle the air, blood dripping 
from his nose, his stole of shoes 
bumping the silent chest, 
its painted veins swelling in votive light, 
his own beginning to pound 
in his temples; the gathered candles 
bunching his shadow on the stationed walls, 
heavy breathing and a strangled voice 
blurring in his ears, lost 
in the slow dark turning toward dawn. 
I knelt at the stump 
and kissed its inner circle 
before standing to undress: 
the sandals of vine, a robe 
the brown of aged trees. 

I saw an open place 
where my lips had been, 
like the mouth of a chalice. 

I felt its width and depth 
and went to my hands and knees 
for twigs and bits of earth 
and dropped them in the hole. 

I scanned the forest 
and lay across the stump, 
my body balanced, shaken 
by spasms that left me limp. 

I arched my back until my hair 
met the soles of my feet, 
the trunk fused to my abdomen. 

I felt my hands rise, 
fingers fluttering 
in a green blur; my head 
bursting into growth, 
hair trembling to leaf, 
flesh curling into bark; 
bird songs filling the air; 
a rush of wings 
sealing my lids to sight.
They've allowed her to stay the night, 
to sit in a metal chair 
and guard her husband's sleep, 
to watch the gauze darken at his throat, 
the hole in his neck 
rising pink around the rim. 

Sometime near dawn, she leaves him 
and heads for the double doors 
at the end of the hall; 
once inside, her fingers fly 
over the operating table. 

On the floor 
she crawls in small circles 
about the center of the room; 
she is sure she will find 
the patch of skin they took. 
She will know it by the stubble 
left on the outer side 
when she shaved him hastily 
herself this morning. 

When she finds it, she will go to him. 
She will hold the wafer up to the window, 
up to the cleansing sun; 
she will lick the edges and secure it 
to the sides of the hole 
healing open like a nostril.
Barebacked and handcuffed to a post 
in the village square of another country, 
he is about to be short-whipped a dozen times 
as she stands with her father who insists 
on pressing charges under Canadian law. 

She looks younger than she did last night, 
but older than the sixteen years he now knows her to be; 
there is time to remember it all: 

The swarming goldfish 
looking more like orange peels thrown by workers 
years before the quarry sprang a leak 
filling itself to the brim, leaving a train 
loaded with rock to rust on its tracks 
now blurred far beneath the raft 
gone lopsided by his weight. 

Before he was dry from his swim from shore, 
she was lifting herself aboard, tanned and untouchable 
as any goddess rising from the sea of a dream. 
A fish nibbled at her toes, and he shared her surprise; 
they propped their heads on their hands 
and talked for the moment it takes to know 
that there are no words. 

Lying together in the dusk, he ran his hands 
through the water, teasing the fish, her fingers 
finding his, her arms wet still and warming, her back 
stretched like young leather, softly oiled, 
her legs straight out and inching toward his until 
they gave heat the length of his body. 

They slid from the raft and swam in silence 
to the farthest rim where the pines had spent years 
preparing the shore. 

He lifted her weight and laid her down at his side 
to watch the fish pucker their mouths and turn 
from his fingertips, her eyes explaining that she'd been 
where he wished to take her, and that she knew 
he would make it seem that she'd never been there 
before. 

The only way out was the way they had come, 
back across the dark water, talking unheard, alone 
-- the beach long empty of swimmers. 

The squad car was perched like a cat in the dunes, 
hidden, until its white eyes opened a path in the sand.

Barebacked and cuffed to the post, he can see 
that the short-whip, curled loose in the sheriff's hand, 
is as tan as her legs set off brown and bare 
against her father's creased white slacks.
A fondness for birch trees 
found her poised in a patch of shade 
where the wind stays broken 
and the ground holds damp 
in a lingering fog. 

Her flared nostrils steamed 
as each sound cleared itself 
in her mind; it was here she learned 
to live-out the seasons, waking 
in half-sleep to her own bleating, 
rising from the residue of a dream 
that has her leaping a cliff, 
falling it seems forever before 
impaling herself on a branch, 
blood blowing like the rapids 
that roared up at her, until she wakes 
unharmed, unsure of things, even 
the grass where she lay. 

It was no dream that brought him to her 
in the midst of that frozen lake, 
four mongrels yelping from shore 
where they gave up the chase, the doe 
sprawled on the ice, her year-old blood 
leaking from a leg snapped in half 
when she leaped for water and found it 
gone, landing on something harder 
than the paths she'd known through woods, 
her good legs spinning her crazily 
toward the center of things. 

The ramshackle door made a raft of sorts, 
and he skidded to her side, working a rope 
for a noose; her sound was that of a child 
shaken in the night, the eyes stunned open 
in disbelief, the voice rattling 
through the windpipe, stopping in time 
to be garbled by the lips. 

He told her things she had to know 
how the rope would seem too tight, how she 
would bound on home before the morning 
even spent itself away. 

The noose settled about the neck and sent 
a shudder down her back; he moved 
as shadows move -- his hand ungloved 
and gliding toward the leg, tangled in rope, 
to set it free, to let the tug-o-war begin. 

But she had other plans, her eyes tight 
on his, a new sound snorting from her throat, 
her lunge crashing short against the door, 
giving too much weight 
for such a mild-wintered lake, and the world 
gave out beneath them. 

It was then he knew he cared only 
for himself, his wife on shore, his children 
at the window, their grandmother talking 
his death away from an earlier grief still 
thundering in her soul, his parents far 
at home, their phone readying itself 
to ring-in the news of his drowning; 
those friends feeling the Sunday air changed 
about them, the reason less than an hour off. 

All that, beyond reach, where he stood 
shoulder-deep in the shallow hole 
of a broken lake, climbing the brittle rim 
only to have it cave-in, dunking him
as often as he tried into water colder 
than he ever imagined water to be, knowing 
he would faint dead away in it, to sink 
where he had floated warm in the sun 
of past summers, alive as any man had ever been. 

And then, as though in dream, he saw his wife 
closer than before, a rope in hand, the lake 
splintering beneath her, risking all she had 
to risk, her eyes meeting his in prayer, 
the rope whirring toward him, a neighbor lugging 
a ladder, gambling his weight and age 
on the groaning surface, the long pull to shore, 
the doe left behind for those with boats 
to axe their way and save her, only to find 
her needing more than they could give, 
hauling her past the crowd, to the inner edge 
of her woods to die -- to take a single slug 
below the ear, her blood run out too far 
to claim, the freeze too deep to thaw.
He stands, greasing himself 
for the hardest swim of his life, 
the jar on a log, its cap 
fallen upside down in the sand, 
flicking splinters of sun 
on the house, all but hidden 
in the dunes, where his wife, 
his son, his daughter lie drugged 
from too much summer. 

If they were to waken 
to the quick licks of light 
playing on the walls, 
they would find him hip-deep 
in the sea, listening to the bell 
tolling from its buoy, marking 
the first leg of his journey. 

He turns and waves 
to the empty windows, ignoring 
the pain lumped hollow 
under his arm. 

He takes a last look 
along the shore and sets out 
through water colder than the lakes 
he grew up in, thicker somehow 
and darker, even the sand 
ribbed like a washboard 
seems closer as it deepens, 
his long arms churning the surface 
as though he were back home 
in the faculty pool, matching 
stroke for stroke with his office 
mate, far more than the game of it 
pushing them on to the tiles 
and back, head over heels in turns, 
neither admitting to keeping score; 
his record growing worse 
during the last of winter 
and all of spring. 

He can't help looking back 
and sees the roof silent and dry, 
its shingles shrunken now to one, 
suggesting the pace he has set 
for himself; he slows and stops, 
allowing his legs to settle 
beneath him, the buoy in sight, 
a few more football fields away. 

He imagines throwing a pass 
and watches it sail the distance 
before striking the bell, breaking 
the steady beat of it, the gong 
making the water tremble; 
he feels it across the shoulders 
and down through the groin. 

The water on his lips tastes 
more like sweat than he remembers; 
the mouthful he takes, the same 
as the gargle he used as a kid; 
he swirls it about 
and spews it out like a whale, 
lying on his back, wishing already 
for a glass of water; better yet: 
bourbon and water on the rocks, 
all on a foam tray he could push 
ahead, all the way out. 

He laughs aloud and takes 
to sidestroking his way awhile, 
easy, almost like lying adrift 
in his father's arms, learning 
to float from his fears, 
knowing vaguely his need for water, 
the clean full feeling he has 
whenever near it or in it. 

With every pull of his hand 
he can see the buoy, 
left hand passing its measure 
of water on to the right, 
the right scooping it on to the feet, 
smooth and steady until 
the boredom of it all starts 
to get him, as it always did, 
those long hours 
in the high school pool: lap 
after lap, the lungs lasting 
longer than his patience. 

In front of him are terns 
searching the waves for breakfast, 
diving straight into the sea, 
disappearing to rise empty, now 
and then a fish small in their beaks; 
eating on the fly. 

No boats returning yet, 
no one insisting he climb aboard 
and tell his tale of shipwreck 
and survival, no one ready to believe 
he could swim from shore.

On his back again, right, left, 
reaching far overhead and out, 
feet doing their work, 
leg muscles loose, no sign of cramps, 
no fatigue; left, right, left, 
just like the old days 
in the senior aquacade, the fancy moves 
showing style and endurance; 
he tries them all: the glides, 
the circle rolls, the egg beater, 
ending in the butterfly, 
both arms jacking him out 
of the water, his shoulders 
feeling the strain, too much, 
the sockets grown rusty. 

He treads water and finds the buoy, 
closer than he thought, and decides 
to race the rest of the way; 
one gulp of air and he's off, 
slap after slap, breathing 
only when breath is gone; 
he gives it everything he's got 
left, glancing ahead, 
keeping his sightline, 
the bell louder and cleaner 
all the time; he glides 
the last few feet 
and touches the casing, barely 
able to hook his feet in the rings, 
his fingers tight on the seam, 
and squints back toward home. 

He begins to shiver, convinced 
he cannot return, that the change 
in his marrow may never be known; 
he hangs on and weeps, pronouncing 
over and over the names of those 
waking on shore without him. 

He closes, at last, his eyes, 
the taste of blood draining 
from his gums, a trace welling 
in his ears, almost 
aware of the bell tolling 
softly tolling, as he slips 
back into the sea.
Two geese joined at the neck 
refuse to go the other's way 
and become themselves 
and then doorkeys 
in search of locks across the lake. 

An arrowhead has missed 
the dog's spine 
blown sky high 
and scattered among fish 
and one prehistoric bird, 
thick-winged and silent, 
owning the sun. 

The long-limbed fox is opening 
a kangaroo's pouch drifting 
ever closer to a turkey, 
one leg kicking 
at a possum in pursuit. 

Off to the west, far from fox 
and dog, fish and geese, 
the crab with transparent pincers 
floats after the wingless sparrow.
I am a beachdog dragging my notebooks 
empty across the sand. 

The palms are hung high with vultures; 
they are soundless, these birds, 
hunched and wary of any living thing, 
save the dying. 

They have blisters for eyes, and helmets 
of grey skin wrinkled about the head. 

Patient, they wait to dress the trees 
with flesh torn hot from those 
left dead in the tourist sun. 

Memory is full to boiling; 
I have come too far not to rest 
awhile, just a little while, 
in the dazzled shade of Maracas. 

The leaves move as though flexed 
by muscle; they dip 
like the heavy shadows of wings.
In the middle of the yard 
he sits on a bench 
and bangs his fists 
on the picnic table, 
pleading with closed windows 
to "call the cops call the cops 
call the stinkin' cops." 

Children from adjoining lawns 
come closer to see the beer cans 
jump like toads, leaving puddles 
that spurt under his fists 
like the spittle of dogs 
shaking their heads. 

He goes on banging and sobbing banging 
and sobbing, flailing his arms 
at the children, searching 
their blurred chests for badges, 
their heads for hats, their hips 
for guns -- something, anything, 
to save him from the banging 
of his fists. 

And now his wife appears, 
strutting like a matron, 
to unlock the garage, to crank-up 
the mower, to drown him out 
with a full tank of gas, driving 
the children back where they belong, 
where parents crane their necks to see 
her tightening her circle, roaring 
closer to the beer cans leaping, 
the fists falling and rising, the mouth 
howling without sound.
Please do not call me at home 
or expect me to drive to yours 
at any time of day or night. 

When you sit here in my office, 
please do not smoke or tear 
items from my magazines. 

Neither talk to my receptionist 
nor whistle, hum, stomp or tap 
to the piped-in music. 

When your name is called, move 
quickly to the appointed room; 
do just as you are told. 

When I enter, be prompt about 
any complaint you may have; do 
not attempt to amuse me. 

Listen to what I have to say 
so I need not repeat myself; 
then dress, taking all belongings. 

Please stop at the desk and pay 
your total bill in cash; checks 
are not welcome here; 

But you are. 
I hope you are feeling better; 
come again when you are not.
I passed your office six times today 
wanting to turn up the broken walk 
and slip inside to wait at the coat rack, 
hoping your nurse would say: well 
as long as you are here I suppose -- 

But I only looked in, recalling 
your leather table and knives, feeling 
the lump on my arm, rubbing it 
hard to make it go away. 

You will find this note when you come 
outside and will check the back seat 
and floor for me and drive off 
in the dark, your mind racing, your wife 
alone at home, miles away. 

Picture me now, my breath hot 
on your kitchen window, my eyes 
sweeping over her like a tongue.
Uninvited 
and unannounced, obsessive fears would take his head, 
causing him to whimper for hours, doubting 
the diagnostic measure of his curse. 

He grew unsure 
of the restraint they said he had by the very nature 
of the malady that seemed perpetual in its motion, 
as though a sack of unborn spiders had absorbed 
his brain. 

He was afraid 
he might do things, strange intricate things, bizarre 
as a web would be if found spun across his open eye. 

As a child 
he'd touch the handrail twice on the way down cellar 
to keep things even and never once stepped on a crack 
because he feared the certain breaking of his mother's 
back. 

He was well 
into his twenties before the vile thoughts began forming 
on the crust of the sack; it took years for them all 
to die. 

But now 
it is mostly the past twitching like the leg of a spider 
will do when pulled from its socket awhile before it dries 
to dust.
From the bus stop he goes straight 
to the closest hardware store; 
he likes hardware stores, always has; 
something to do with the iron and wood 
of the place: hinges, bolts, axe handles; 
nice to touch, to rub. 

He fondles a work glove and lays it aside, 
enjoying the smell it leaves 
on the tips of his fingers. 

He reaches a back counter to find 
three types, but sees at once the pair 
he needs; they have short rubbered-grips, 
and in the crotch, just above the connecting bolt, 
a circular section, a half moon 
on each blade; when open, the mouths 
gape at each other. 

He hands them to the clerk and waits 
for the change to come back across 
the thick wooden slab worn grey 
by a lifetime of Saturdays. 

He leaves the store and crosses 
against the light, stuffing the empty bag 
in a litter basket screwed to a pole. 

His mind goes prickly, as it always does 
in new towns, this close to action; 
he palms the cutters and walks the three blocks 
-- nodding as he goes: here to a shopper, there 
to a child on his bike, an old man rotting 
on a wooden bench bolted to the sidewalk. 

He slows his pace at the walkway, takes it 
in stride, and enters the vestibule, moving 
respectfully to the parlor on his left 
where clots of mourners ignore him. 

The rhythm in his chest picks up, his mouth 
dries out, he kneels -- crossing himself alone, 
and takes what he has come for.
Its nail needs trimming 
but if I pull the scissors 
from their case I will surely 
ease them in under the nail 
spreading a sleek white path 
back through the quick 

A week ago I slammed it 
in a door it pulsed 
and bled in my mouth 

Last night I lay for hours 
with it tucked under its hand 
flicking it out from hiding 
to flex it adjusting to the fact 
that I might someday remove it 
by the drop of the kitchen cleaver 
without a thumb a hand is less a hand 

They tense up sometimes 
as though they need something 
to do as though they might 
rise flapping from my lap 
like wings of restless birds 

On elevators I am afraid 
they will go to someone's throat 
in sleep I keep them jammed 
between my thighs and awakening 
often in the dark soak them 
long in the bathroom sink 
the coldest water turning them blue 
each finger a fish jerking 
on its hook.
He has spent another night 
walking through waves of nausea, 
balancing the pain behind his eyes 
to keep it from falling 
through the roof of his mouth 
and out onto the rug, 
showing itself to be the walnut 
he pictures growing 
in a fold of his brain. 

His coveralls will make him 
a keeper of the grounds, intent 
on doing battle once again 
with the filthy brood of pigeons 
that has called the height its own. 

He will set up housekeeping in the air, 
above the campus, where the tower's view 
of Texas is grand and clean. 

A footlocker, salvaged from a tour of duty 
still active in his mind, will contain 
provisions for the rest of his life: 
ammunition to last the day, 
rimmed by canned meats and fruit 
and a rolled towel standing white 
beside a spray deodorant. 

In the shade given back by the wall, 
he will lay three pistols, empty 
and cracked open, next to a pair of rifles 
soothed in oil, their telescopes hanging 
ready in leather sacks. 

He will give what he has to give 
to anyone in sight, 
completing the lives of fourteen strangers 
and changing the color of August 
for the dozens left to bleed. 

When it is finished, 
when his captors unfurl his towel 
and wave it above his death, 
he will join those dead as they rise 
from their scarlet shadows 
toward a dream he sent his women to: 

Where the broken bodies of mother and wife 
will mend themselves and drift in clouds, 
whispering their love for him, 
their fingers longing to soothe his brow 
still barbed in pain.
John rocks in his steel crib 
and remembers the battle plan 
that lost him his legs 
and arms and voice. 

John writes with a bulk-pencil 
strapped to his chin. 

John wanted pity at first, then 
John wanted love, then 
John wrote his ex-boss asking 
for the position of Chief 
paperweight. 

John has a page-turner now; 
better than the nose-method 
he'd used for the first five 
years; it was donated. 

John listens to the volunteers 
for just so long these days, 
and then burrows his head 
under the pillow, and comes up 
waving a small American flag 
between his teeth.
He sat in the tub, dry 
in his undershorts, his 
shirt and trousers neat 
on the toilet lid 

A new blade in the soap 
dish, a can of Drano 
in his left hand 

On top of the faucets 
the bread knife he had 
bought that afternoon 

He reached a bathroom glass 
and filled it half full 
of Drano, added all 
the water it would take 
and stirred it well 
with his finger 

He drank it down 
and nine times 
put the knife into 
his belly, next 
the razor each wrist 
often 

He left a trail to the hall 
where he crawled for help 
to live to die again.
He has taken to weeping 
while finding his way 
back to his room. 

By noon he curls up 
in a knot and squints 
himself to sleep 
for the rest 
of the day. 

Sometimes he has toast 
and milk before bed 
so he won't wake up 
in the afternoon. 

Often he showers 
before drawing the shades 
and removing the phone 
from its cradle. 

Once, unable to sleep, 
he scrubbed the floor 
with a washcloth. 

Last Tuesday, a man told him 
no one would ever hire 
anyone who wore a sweater 
under his sport coat. 

Yesterday, a man swore 
he would hire him 
within the year; he even 
put his name in his desk. 

But they can all read his face; 
it tells them what they know
already: he has gone too long; 
they are right in turning him 
back to the street.
He saw the cardinal, 
perched like a fist of blood, 
fall through his mind 
to the ground 
where the girl's body 
worked with the wind 
to form a curled drift 
that kept the river 
from rising to claim her. 

She lay as though in bed, 
one arm bent across her brow, 
the moon shading her lips 
and left shoulder. 

Puffs of snow 
had settled on her eyes 
like gobs of cotton 
younger girls use 
to shield their lids 
at summer shores. 

She was nude, 
save a stocking 
the color of sun-tanned legs 
knotted 
around her neck 
much the way she might 
have worn a scarf. 

Her hair 
flecked with night snow 
was frozen to the skin 
of a bulging root. 

Kneeling to learn her face, 
he found only frost, and rose 
to dress her warm 
in a garment of green branches.
The chapel doors are chained 
and the parents cannot get at the poet 
to stop him from reading to their daughters 
who have rented him for the afternoon. 

One woman swears she saw him 
carrying a suitcase crammed with poems, 
some sticking out of the corners 
like underwear. 

The parents have rimmed the building 
and pound it with their fists, 
growing louder by the hour; and now 
the stained glass windows are crashing 
open with borrowed books and shoes; 
but the poet will not stop reading. 

The coeds climb one another 
to shield the poet who wants to read 
his whole valise of poems. 

Parents have reached the ledges 
and are poking at their daughters 
who moan in unison, 
straining to hear the poet. 

He goes on for still another hour and stops. 
He packs his poems and puts on his hat; 
he steps to the nearest window 
where a girl smiles and opens her legs for him; 
he wraps his arms around his poems 
and crawls through her before dropping 
to the lawn where he waits for the parents 

To notice; they do and beat on him 
until he opens his case 
and gives them each a poem; there are not enough 
and he takes out pads of yellow paper 
and squats at their feet, writing more poems 
that are snatched away. 

The first readers are finished 
and rip the poems into flakes 
that settle about him like moths; 
they want more, and he writes them 

While their daughters take turns 
putting their fingers in his mouth, 
their bodies writhing in ecstasy 
as they feel the movement of letters 
closing into words.
I.

The one on our right is tuxedoed; 
the other is wrapped in a sling of burlap, 
pinned low at the hip; both are bald, 
neither is tanned, though summer is just over; 
most certainly they are brothers. 

On a stretch of bamboo, some well-used 
paraphernalia: a two-foot run 
of garden hose, a larger cut 
of steel rod, the antique thumbscrew 
seen in the advertisements, 
& a helmet, its iron straps 
crossing like the weave of a basket. 

At the back wall of the stage, hung 
in black scrims, are four shapes; 
nothing is said of them, 
but we do learn from the diapered twin 
that the brother is mute; 
we respond with applause, & the mute 
bows, extending his hand to his brother 
who affixes the thumbscrew & leads 
him to the footlights. 

He asks the front row 
to note the pressure of wood on bone; 
it is a young woman who winks 
at her companion & stands, 
giving the knob an extra turn; we stomp 
& whistle for the mute 
who is dancing on one foot, trying 
to loosen the screw that squeaks 
in its socket; he tosses it off 
to the lady who presses it hard 
to her lips. 

His brother is calling him back 
to center stage where he is struck 
on the swelling thumb, across both thighs, 
the face & top of head, the hose 
leaving welts to last the matinee. 

He limps upstage, smoothing away 
his bruises, & removes 
the first black cloth; we see 
a roughshod contraption of four legs, 
a comical horse's head 
& a backbone too sharp for sitting; 
we are told it is The Timber Mare 
of dungeon days. 

The mute drops his pants, & mounts, 
awaiting his brother's climb; 
we admire his pain, & clap till our palms sting, 
his brother balancing & leaping up 
& down on the mute's pale shoulders. 

If he could make a sound, 
it would be now, but nothing comes 
from the open mouth, and it is over; 
he is on one leg again, pulling 
his trousers on, as his brother skips 
to the second cloth, giving us 
The Rack, its huge wheel glistening 
like a spool of thread used up. 

The mute is fitted to the bottom ropes 
& cuffed to those above; he is 
asked questions of faith, & nods 
his head in answer, but none will do; the stomach 
skin stretches, the jacket slides 
up, the shirttail comes out; 
but the brother is tired of turning the stile; 
the ropes sag, the mute slumps, 
the curtain falls. 

We hurry to the lobby 
where the twins have promised to mingle, & find 
the mute somehow refreshed, the other, 
sullen against a wall, promising more 
than our money's worth once 
back in our seats. 

II. 

The houselights blink & the performers 
leave through a side door to the alley, the mute 
patting the other's back, trying 
to lift his spirit, but he'll have none of it. 

The stage looks the same; there are 
new costumes; the mute: 
leather trousers & vest, mountain boots 
laced on hooks. The other wears faded dungarees. 

Falanga is first -- the steel rod glitters 
in the mute's gloved hand, & already 
it is clear his brother 
is a poor sport; seated on one chair, 
he complains as his feet are forced into the slats 
of another; the soles face us. 

The mute begins by tapping, but now 
he is whipping, studiously, 
the rod whirring in the air, the brother 
biting his tongue, waiting it out; we count twelve 
strokes; the mute dislodges the feet, 
& the brother stays put, 
soles too puffed to stand. 

Beneath the third cloth is The Chair, 
four-wheeled & homemade, its power drawn 
from the car battery bolted to its side, two clamps 
as large & as red as needle-nosed pliers 
are attached to the skin of the Adam's apple 
& the slight roll of fat at the waist. 

The mute flicks on the head-high electrometer, 
with numerals large enough to see, & from behind 
The Chair, he eases a dial from zero to nine; 
the brother glares above us; twenty 
gets a jump, back to twelve, up to thirty-five; 
the brother braces himself, pants for breath 
when he sinks to ten, & is jerked from his seat 
when the needle hits fifty & falls; his curse 
tells the mute he has gone too far; he 
reminds him of the evening ahead on The Rack. 

The Helmet is a thumbscrew for skulls, 
& the brother adjusts it to size, his spirit 
lighter, explaining the headaches pagans 
were given; the mute smiles & takes a card 
from his vest, unfolding it for all to see 
its word: Excedrin; we applaud as he tightens 
the nut with a common wrench. 

The brother has said "enough" four times, 
but the mute is turning toward his own idea 
of enough, & the brother pulls 
at The Helmet, letting words fly unrehearsed 
through the darkened theatre. 

Now the mute glides to the last cloth, 
removing it as one might take a shawl 
from a birdcage, & it is that, exactly: a huge 
barred cage, the padlock hanging open 
on its ring; how strong the mute must be; 
he has his brother in his arms, like a child, 
knees to face, arms pinned; he sticks him 
in the cage & secures the door. 

There is much complaining, begging the mute 
to remove The Helmet, but the mute is fumbling 
with a switch; the cage starts to revolve, 
its turntable gaining momentum, as a music, 
heard often at carnivals, flows to the ear. 

The mute is bowing & clapping, leading us all 
in applause, stopping to point at the brother, 
as a conductor points at a star; spinning, 
spinning, the merry-go-round tune 
too loud to hear; we rise to our feet, 
as the curtain descends, the lights come on, 
& souvenirs go on sale in the aisle.
The drift he slams into swallows the hood; 
he rams the gearshift into reverse and listens 
to the tires burning themselves bald, the wind 
sealing the road behind; there's no going back. 

He turns off the ignition and laughs; already 
late for supper, he allots two hours for the plow 
to make its way to this back road he took at whim, 
another test of his mettle; every day more proof 
piling up, giving him strength to go on, 
surviving on memory alone. 

Forty, greying, he stuffs his pants cuffs inside 
his socks, zips his jacket to the throat 
and slips on his racing gloves, the leather 
matching his leftover tan as it shows through 
the patterned holes; he steps out into the snow, 
knowing what to do: 

The trunk opens easily, the tiny bulb giving 
light enough to work; he unscrews the spare tire 
and lays it flat on the roof, talking to it, 
explaining what it must become, his pleasure 
more proof helping to ward off the trace of panic 
he knows drifts like a shadow at the edge of the road. 

The sun visor breaks off neatly, making a scoop 
to scatter the snow from the hood; he opens it 
and unhooks the gas filter cup; he carries it off, 
chuckling, pleased, stumbling ahead to the dashboard 
where he shoves in the lighter and waits for it 
to pop. 

He pours the fuel on some crumpled paper and pokes 
the orange-coiled lighter at the center of the tire, 
pulling back at the whoosh of flame; he controls 
the fire: large enough to warm the inside of the car, 
small enough to conserve the burnables he has piled 
on the front seat: glove compartment maps, credit card 
tissues, six or seven old lists, a driver's manual, 
last night's newspaper, and two man-sized Kleenex 
he stuffed in his pocket at home this morning. 

Already proud, his lips twitch as he realizes 
there are yards of cardboard lining any car's 
insides; he thinks of the look his insurance man 
will have on his straight-lipped face when he sees 
the car in the morning, destroyed for salvation; 
the papers will surely do a story, pictures, quotes. 

He dismantles both headlights, leaving their wires 
attached, and props them in the snow, aimed skyward, 
and gets back in the driver's seat flicking them on: 
high low off on, a perfect signalling system for any 
snowmobilers, roaring drunk through virgin drifts 
laced with fence posts and abandoned jalopies; 

He knows the papers will set his next move in bold 
type; off comes the oil filter, on goes the lubricant: 
face, hands, back of neck, deep into both ears, 
explaining aloud to tomorrow's reporters the need 
for layers of oil, how vulnerable the hairless human 
ear is to chill, the fragile pink fading to swollen 
grey, yellowish white. 

He sees a quarter-page photograph of himself 
in a ridiculous hospital gown, pillowed-up in bed, 
smiling faintly to his left; again the visor 
shoveling snow high against the wind, leaving only 
his door open a crack to keep the lock from freezing; 
back inside he flicks on the dome light and breaks 

The rearview mirror with pliers, close at the edge 
so it splinters, giving him three thin blades 
to strip the ceiling, allowing the tire's heat 
to come in; he slashes holes in the back seat, 
enough for feet and hands, another for shoes 
and socks; he waits until he warms, pleased 
with everything he's done. 

But he knows there must be more to do; he studies 
every inch of his room, trying for the extra touch 
that will give the newspaper boys a headline, 
a handle for a feature; he smiles and begins ripping, 
wielding the glass like a scalpel: 

Floor mats, lining, seat covers -- and fashions a suit 
of clothes: mittens and hat, scarf and shawl, pants, 
boots, all jammed full of seat stuffing, tied loose 
with seat belts and shoelaces; he will explain he was 
about to make a pair of snowglasses out of the back 
directional cups but they found him too soon. 

He dresses and goes outside, removing his hand-guards 
to feed the fire another slab of cardboard, recalling 
the way he dropped envelopes by the dozen 
into the corner mailbox three weeks ago, almost late 
but close enough for Christmas; close enough 
is the way he likes it, always has. 

He refuses to look at his watch; he knows 
it has all taken too long -- clever but not clever 
enough to take up the slack between the car and plow; 
he curses the driver perched on his stool in some 
two-bit diner, sipping coffee spoiled with milk, 
a greasy doughnut ringing his finger, his boots 
running snow, puddles forming on the linoleum, 
streams wider than the shoelaces binding his leggings, 
twisting toward the door, urging him up and out. 

He hears him brag on about the weather, the way 
he blasts it off the roads, how he's beaten his own 
record already: only five back roads to go, 
and the snow coming so fast he may forget about them 
and start over from the beginning -- no one in his 
right mind would travel those others on such a night 
anyhow. 

He tastes a second cup of coffee hot in the back 
of his brain, trying to suck it down; he moves his eyes 
to the rearview mirror, hoping he is wrong, 
planning to see the glaring lights of the plow picking him out 
of the night, but he sees only a few flakes of glass left 
on the flat tin backing. 

He leaps within himself, remembering the car top, 
clawing the air toward the tire, finding its blaze 
dead, its ashes wet and done for; he gets back 
in the front seat, turns the key hard to the right, 
hears a rattle and remembers the hood wide open, 
the motor, the battery covered with snow; he says 
nothing, but takes the tire down from the roof 
and puts it back in the trunk, still open, its snow 
swirling up at him. 

He decides to leave the headlights where they are 
and gets back inside, locking the door behind him; 
piece by piece by piece he pushes all the stuffing 
he can find back into place, regretting the damage 
he's done to the cushions and walls and ceiling. 

He sits behind the wheel, and for the first time 
becomes aware of snow leaking in where the vent latch 
is gone; within the hour, frost starts forming 
on his cheek, flakes fall on his left shoulder, the bulb 
overhead continues to fade. 

With fingers strangely warm, he pulls the headlight knob 
and lowers his foot to the pedal: on-off, on-off, 
imagining the beams changing their tilt 
somewhere beneath the snow.
I rise from the sun-deck 
to enter the thicket 
in search of a bouncing ball, 
and find instead a grenade 
rolling toward a thatched hut. 

And I go deep within it: 
my eyes dropping to a sling, 
hung from criss-cross poles, 
supporting a child, sleeping 
above the settling ball. 

The concussion blows the roof off 
like a puff of dandelion fuzz: 
gently, not to waken the infant 
wrapped in flame and floating 
slowly, head over heels through leaves. 

I watch until he burns away in the sun.
A man just died under my nose; 
he sat down on the pavement 
eleven stories below 
and tried to hold his heart 
in place, as I leaned out 
to watch him die, careful 
to clutch the sill 
so I wouldn't beat him 
to death in mid-air. 

I closed the blinds, 
but not in time to keep 
his wife and children 
from screaming 
in the center of my desk.
The dead rise in memory to fix 
their eyes on rooms gone empty 
without them; they swell like balloons 
on the airy lips of children. 

They will find you alone, at night, 
seated in darkness; say nothing 
save their names; no greeting, 
no words of disbelief, only the names. 

They will sense your trust, 
taking the breath from the walls, 
tasting the carpet for salt 
left from the tears you spilled. 

You will hear them behind the chair, 
parting the fabric, arranging themselves 
in the stuffing, sitting atop one another 
in your position; the slightest pressure 
beneath your legs, against your back, 
will tell you they are there. 

Speak their names soothingly, time 
and again; by dawn you will feel 
frantic motion and then nothing at all. 

Turn all lights on; open all windows; 
look for the yellow taint of heat, 
the slight marks where the cloth 
has been fused. 

On the third day, inscribe a thin cross 
on the seat cushion, and bum the chair 
where it stands, intoning the names 
as softly as your voice allows; watch 
for shapes in the flame, in smoke. 

Only then will you see them clearly, 
bursting a moment beyond recognition.
He once dreamed of burning this house 
       rather than bicker with his sisters 
       over the relics of her life. 

But she had her way, as mothers do, 
       and he followed her shadow 
       through endless rooms 

All the while digesting the words 
       that described the last remains 
       her daughters must share with him 

Like mice sniffing their larder 
       in darkened pantries; 
       there's a hutch 

For a breezeway, the dry-sink 
       for a cluttered kitchen floor, 
       a kidney-desk and wing chair 

Waiting like tombstones 
       to crowd a pitiful living room; 
       the spoolbed, the sleighbed 

The chest of drawers ready to warp 
       and flake in the rafters 
       of a desolate garage. 

When she's gone, they'll be back 
       to handle things 
       and claim her 

Lefthand diamond, to lock the house 
       and remove those 
       crystal doorknobs.
She was eager to be heard and nibbled on memories, 
while I listened to the mournful chewing, and 
scraped the last puddle of vanilla ice cream 
from a deep-bottom dish with a silver-black spoon. 
The wool-wrapped legs barely showed but bulged 
beneath uncountable layers of arctic skirts 
safety-pinned each day against the imaginary freeze. 
There were always cookies in the pickle crock 
and Pepsi in jelly jars during those hours together 
in that fear-fed neighborhood on the fringe of Lake Erie. 

I remember her padding blindly about, 
in her frayed maroon slippers, pressing dustballs 
and giant hairpins into the silent carpet; 
a copper-colored gas heater pumped itself year 'round, 
and the temperature held to its constant eighty-five, 
having leapt there once many years before. 
The sun would sear its way through two paper shades 
that were drawn and tacked against the eternal glare, 
as I'd read to her from the accumulated mail, 
a slim stack forever staling in open envelopes. 

And then the men came -- 
they tapped at the windows, 
took the tacks from the shades, 
broke the ice cream bowls, 
hid her slippers, 
unpinned her skirts, 
stole her mail, 
and sat on the table-top to taunt her. 
Only finger-tip tall, they were never seen, 
but she assaulted them daily, fiercely. 
In the end, they went away, leaving her alone 
with the fear that they might return. 
She died in her sleep without them.
Those eyes refused to stay indoors; 
instead, they rode their own cataracts 
and washed ashore at the foot 
of San Juan Hill in time to watch 
eighteen hundred men lace their boots 
in Grandma's darkened sunporch. 

From my vantage point 
on Great Uncle's lap, I heard 
General Shafter address his troops 
and lead the attack. 

Uncle Steve followed him and left me 
alone in the lowlands, 
already cluttered with legs 
of understanding relatives 
and a green hassock, frayed but firm 
enough for a warrior's foothold. 

Grandmother took my hand 
and hurried out of the war zone, 
as Uncle Steve ranted on and rode off 
into combat somewhere near the front 
door shining with its double lock 
of inescapable security.
There is no hi-hat, but he finds one 
in the air around his knees 
and keeps the offbeat 
while his supper tray jiggles on his lap, 
taking the beating he gives it 
with crossrods from two wooden hangers. 

They keep him downstairs 
so those wrapped in silence 
along the upper walls won't complain 
about paradiddles accompanied 
by the rudimentals of ma-ma-da-da 
and the barefooted thud tap thud, 
thud tap thud, of a man 
at work. 

A radio drifts in from the ward 
overhead, and wood takes on straw 
as clothesbrushes move across plastic, 
scratching a chee-chaa from the thirties. 

He watches his face in waves of glass 
and smiles through stubble; he sees 
his nursemaid swallow her laughter 
and tuck him back to bed 
to watch his life spin across the ceiling 
and down the wall, finding itself 
again in the cracked and shadowed 
mirror.
An hour, maybe two, was all he had 
before he left; he wouldn't look 
at any of the things he'd made 
from dreams before it all went bad. 

He wanted to know: 
would we replace the wooden icebox; 
might the cabin become another house; 
were we able to close a place for winter. 

He taught us to cut limb-poles 
big around as an upper arm, 
and prop them in under joists, 
over the main floor beam, to keep 
the roof from caving in. 

We learned to make shutters 
for the drifting snow, and how to nail 
higher windows shut against hunters 
looking for a stopping place. 

We wouldn't have thought of mothballs 
for the floors to ward off mice, 
or antifreeze for the sinks & bowls & tank, 
or screening for the drain hose 
where bugs swarm throughout the fall. 

Before he left, he pointed out the spot 
where we might chain our own canoe 
upside down under the cabin, 
where it would wait dry for the lake 
until it finally thawed somewhere in spring.
It was more like a dream than an ending, 
the lawn chairs adrift on the grass, 
the elm trees parting politely 
so that ladies kept waiting might pass 
before Bartlett returns from the pantry 
where he's won some affection at last. 

They enter the lake without Bartlett, 
and settle down in the sand; 
the windows are closed, except Bartlett's, 
the handle comes off in the hand; 
and Bartlett goes right on romancing, 
knowing that they'll understand. 

They sit as they sat as they waited 
for Bartlett in fine livery 
who's taking them all Sunday driving 
and bringing them back for tea, 
but Bartlett has conquered some virtue 
and lingers inside wistfully. 

And now though he's diving to find them, 
and even holds open the door, 
there is little to say of his sorrow 
as he floats them each back to the shore 
where the others have come to verandas 
to see the five ladies once more.
We'd hitch out from town, 
over the bridge and across 
the island's baking dust to the dockside 
tavern where we'd see, 
through rusted screens, the same lost men 
bent at the bar, their day's ration 
of coins spilled before them. 

They'd watch us strip to our trunks 
on the pier, plastered 
with no-swimming signs, cursing 
our miserable youth to themselves, 
treading their way toward dusk, 
a swallow at a time. 

A riverboat of sorts was marooned there, 
a hideout for rats, but we'd take over 
the second deck, standing three-high 
on each other and topple as one 
into the dark Niagara, coming up 
draped in garlands of slime. 

Adrift in memory is that faceless man 
who set aside his beer 
and mumbled onto the dock to climb 
to the highest tier. 

We knew the black water 
like the inside of our mouths: 
the cable-locks and every underwater 
point where holding-piles grew 
like stunted oaks. 

We yelled our warnings and watched 
him leap, tumbling like a bag of bones. 

He hit six inches of water, 
forty foot of wood, hooked somehow 
by the seat of his pants 
like a bar rag ready to ge wrung out 
and carried back inside 
where it belonged. 
He hanged himself last night 
       quiet in his own cellar 
       while his wife tidied up 
       the kitchen overhead. 

She called his name softly, 
       aware of the pain 
       that had hung in his head 
       since the fall last spring. 

She called a second time 
       and dried both hands 
       on her apron as she pattered 
       down the stairs to find him 

Swaying from a nylon cord knotted 
       hard against the sewer pipe; 
       he must have stood there 
       silent on his toolbox 

And kicked himself free, plunging 
       feet first into darkness, 
       flushing the ache from his life 
       like a house-moth caught 

In the swirl of a bathroom bowl.
The papers report 
that you have been found 
drifting and bobbing 
fifteen days downstream 
from where you broke 
the November silence 
and slipped 
from no one's sight. 

Heavy with death 
you rose from the riverbed, 
layers of fish parting 
to allow your passage 
through their gaze 
before giving you up 
to the eyes of a man 
facing his Sunday alone 
along the shore. 

You are landlocked now 
in dry clothes and candlelight 
close to those you leave 
to drown 
in the wake of your going. 

Tomorrow, the hole in the Hudson 
will heal.
Arnie, you were just too short 
for your own good; 
nothing could make you tall: 
not the extra heels nailed 
drunkenly to both shoes, hidden 
by dungarees dragging the floor, 
your chef's hat rising a foot 
overhead, that bowery face 
somehow always in pain, 
those snakes curling their ink 
the length of your arms; nothing, 
not even the milk crates 
you walked like a bridge 
in front of the stoves, tending 
the burners like a man 
too tall for such a bend; 
nothing did anything, Arnie, 
but remind us that the inches 
you mourned were somewhere 
beyond that mountain 
hell-hole of pots and pans 
where you always came up short.
When death comes, it will find them 
here where we tucked them away 
like used kleenex, she in one wing 
he in the darker, she to a suite 
of carpets and drapes and her name 
on the door, giving a confusion of home. 

His room is as grey as mouseskin, 
the warped linoleum adding only 
a trim of blue-black flowers 
to the bottoms of walls; 
the windows are sealed 
yet the screens are intact 
in this ward for the terminally ill. 

Her hair has been cut 
to suit the fashion of the place; 
the clothes she came in 
have been washed and laid to rest 
on a shelf she can't quite reach; 
she obeys like the others 
and wears the pantsuits she found 
swaying on velveteen hangers 
in her closet of gold-rimmed mirrors. 

His wardrobe is his own: 
the same flannel shirt tucked 
in dark green trousers, the 
cigarette hole at the crotch 
still light around the rim. 

She eats her meals on her side 
of things, with plush pile chairs 
and tin chandeliers and fourteen 
plastic flowers all in a row. 

He dines at the end of his hall, 
raising his hand for service 
or a push to the lobby to meet her, 
his slippers dragging ahead 
of the wheels. 

She has permission to leave 
her sector to join him, and does 
most days, taking her place 
at his side, where they wait 
watching the door.
He feels the catheter as penis, 
is pleased with its sudden growth, 
and goes to great lengths fondling 
what he can't raise his head to see; 
"Pinocchio" says I; and the urine 
trickles to its holding bag. 

In a haze that won't describe itself, 
he sees the bottles above his head, 
and wonders what good they do; 
"Oil change" says I; and the drops 
fall to his arm and in; 
"Smart Ass" says he; "You bet yours" 
says I, and the toes of one foot 
move the sheet in pleasure. 

They like him here; like his bark, 
the way he tells them why 
they feel so smug, well enough 
to baby him, reminding them 
they'll be in a crib some day; 
"Time's coming" says he. 
"Whatever you say, Henry -- whatever." 

"Damn right" says he. Cancer or no, 
he says it out: the chaplain on rounds, 
gold watch and fob and vest, 
comes puffing in to ask How-are-you-doing- 
today-Henry? "Dying, thank you" says he. 
What-is-your-line-of-work-Henry? 
"English professor" says he. Oh-I'd- 
better-watch-what-I-say, he says. "All 
self-conscious people say that" says he. 
Well-have-a-nice-day, he says. 
"Amen" says he. 

He still has his own mustache, and wants 
to know what the plastic one does; "Oxygen 
without the tent" she sings; "Enjoy it 
like a breath of spring." -- "Awful" says he. 
"Behave" she says. "Beat it" says he. 
"Please leave for a while" she says; 
"I want to do his bedsores." -- "Live it up" 
says I. "Smart Ass" says he. "Yours, 
at the moment" says I. "Bet yours" says he; 
and she rolls him off his rubber ring. 

          The lounge is empty, the magazines 
older than a barbershop's; nothing 
changes -- faces smile and frown, open 
and close; gossip and death survive. 

Now he is propped on his side, his rump 
healing in open air; the phone 
rings from Alaska; the voice is hard 
to place, but her name makes the catheter 
jump on its hook. "She doesn't know" 
says he; "It's been years." -- "I'll write her" 
says I. "Leave her be" says he. "Like hell" 
says I; he shakes his head 
in mock dismay, and sleeps in snow 

For a matter of minutes, waking 
in an old dream with three women naked 
on a parched lawn, holding him down 
in a shallow pine box; he's cold 
and yelling for help. "Why 
wouldn't you come; where were you?" 
"Right here; it's all right, 
I'm right here." Again sleep, longer, 
deep enough to send me home. 

Route 59 is slurred with rain; cars dead 
along the curbs; the stink of the ward 
hangs on. 

The clock on the mantel clangs time 
and again, the phone wakens the house, 
a nurse talks from his room: he's confused, 
thinks he is lost, would I talk him 
back to sleep, do what I can. 
"It'll be okay, Henry; it's just 
a dream, like the box on the lawn; 
the nurses will get you blankets, 
and tuck you in, get you more milk, 
one of those whopping pills; let me talk 
with her again; you'll sleep, 
you'll see." -- "My ass" says he. 
"No thanks" says I; "I saw it this afternoon."
He has chosen fifteen 
from the side of the track, 
and now the sixteenth; 
he shakes them 
in his cupped hands 
like a man rattling bar dice 
after his money is gone. 

They are all about the same: 
grey, smooth, just as they were 
a year ago when he'd run 
four miles before breakfast 
-- in rain, snow, summer heat, 
no matter. 

He watches the runners, 
different yet the same, 
sweatshirts wet on their backs, 
legs pounding the stones in place, 
a sudden burst of speed 
as they pass by, nodding his way 
with the nod a newsboy gives 
with change, cautiously, 
making sure his fingers don't 
touch your palm. 

He's wanted to come here 
to the grandstand, stark 
in its concrete 
and bolted slabs of wood, 
and the stones -- most of all 
the stones; 

He remembers how he'd fondle them, 
flicking one away each time 
he finished a lap, running 
flatout with the last one 
tight inside his fist, 
keeping it, storing it away 
with the others at home. 

The runners are at the far bend 
and coming hard -- they will pass him 
again, where he stands aside, 
feeling the stones tumbling 
in the dark 
he has made of his hands.

He's made the flight before, 
but never in a wheelchair strapped 
back-to-back to the last seat in tourist, 
within earshot of a leggy stewardess 
complaining of a rough night in Cincinnati. 

The secret he's kept in his abdomen 
feels like a loaf of bread swallowed whole, 
deep in its wraps of flesh and blankets, flexing 
its tendrils from hip to groin, sedatives 
cooling it down. 

He's cold enough to be naked; sure enough 
that he's going to explode 
that he almost asks for help, but forces 
sleep instead. He wakens 

To a sinking feeling that takes him aground. 
And then a ride flat out 
on a canvas litter whose wheels 
squeal through the carpeted tunnel, 
clearing the way to the terminal with its ceiling 
wide as a ballpark. Outdoors they hit 
a wind worse than Lake Erie. 

Up a rattly old ramp to a hospital van, 
complete with a wall of bottles and tubes 
and a lanky bag of oxygen draped over its tank. 

The trip from LaGuardia 
reminds him of Verdun, the back roads, 
the afternoon of forest patrol in the Argonne, 
birds escaping like soot in the sky, safe 
from the low cloud of mustard gas sniffing 
at his leggings, finding the sweat it needed 
to bring him to his knees. 

The volunteer at his side looks more 
like a street-sweeper, white coveralls baggy 
as a clown's, but she knows what he needs 
to hear: Deep-breathe when the pain comes; 
Exhale it slowly away; Go limp at the bumps: 
potholes that could hold their own 
in a minefield. 

At dusk, they'd settle into the trenches, 
scraping hollows in the front wall, and sit 
with the war behind them, heads to their knees, 
helmets tilted back in case 
shell fragments caught them off guard. 
The thought makes him shudder, 
and he looks at the bulb overhead, wishing 
he could cup it in his hands. 

She wants to help and assumes 
it's a bother. She flicks it off, bringing 
the night inside; he takes it in both 
eyes, adjusting to it, anxious to see out 
the windows of the double back doors. 

There are punctual bursts 
of arc-lamps, truckers flashing their brights 
to pass, billboards lit up 
for late commuters. 

She is telling him what they will do 
at the curb: the unlocking, the lift, the cold 
air and nurses waiting to lead him to a stall, 
the questions they will ask. She warns him 
of the entryway: heaters jutting 
from the tiles, an unearthly orange glow 
everywhere. 

She is calling ahead, giving 
estimated arrival time; she spells his last name, 
his first, and remembers the PH in Stephen. 

The roads curve more in town, just as they did 
in Verdun: three weeks in bed, 
pampered and groomed. This 
will be a shorter stay: The end of the line, 
he says to the hand at his face. 

The van stops, lurches once 
in each direction. The motor runs on, feeding 
exhaust through the floorboards. She is up 
from her jumpseat, putting a shoulder 
to the door. 

The blankets are olive drab to his chin. 
Strangers take him up and out, 
held for a moment 
on a rush of cold air 
before turning headfirst 
into a corridor of orange light. 
He remembered to ease back on the key 
before turning to the left.  It clicked 
open and the tin weatherstripping creaked 
as he stepped inside.                      

Something rushed over him; he went to his knees 
and found himself making the sign of the cross: 
forehead, breastbone, shoulder, shoulder. 
It was as though he'd tried to take a breath 
underwater. He stayed put 

And pushed the door shut without looking 
back. He was staring at the red-ribbed chair 
where his father should be, the slippers 
under the footstool, a brown cardigan laid 
over the armrest for a moment 
three weeks ago.  In front of him 

Was the blanket his mother kept            
on the davenport for the naps that gave her 
strength for lunch at the kitchen table. 

The door swung in at his touch, settling 
against the side of the stove. There were dishes 
in the drainer, and others left undone 
from that last breakfast: two coffee cups 
and saucers, a napkin folded at its place, 
a plate whose toast was gone.

The door to the back hall was closed, 
the skeleton key dangling on its rubberband 
from the doorknob. He opened it a crack 
and listened; the refrigerator hummed 
at full blast. Inside, he saw a half loaf 
of bread, some eggs in the door-rack. Three 
covered bowls held leftovers from October. 

The backdoor key was where it belonged, 
on the cuphook near the dustpan. He took 
the four steps down and started outside, but 
came back in and latched the storm door, 
leaving the other ajar. He went downstairs, 
flicking the switch with the jolt it always needed. 

Near the furnace, beneath the bare bulb, 

  he took out the list. At the washtubs, he pulled 
  the lightstring and squatted at the hot-water 
tank, thumbing the dust from the dial. 
He forced it left and heard the pop. 

There were three shirts and a nightgown 
on the clothesline that stretched to the fruitcellar. 
He dragged his hand across them and turned 
the handle of the door he'd helped build. 
It needed an upward yank. The high window 
was black with paint, but the ceiling switch, 
once too high to reach, sent light across the shelves 
of canning jars, their rubber rings dried out 
in open tins, pans, vases, trays, cardboard boxes 
wilting along the seams. 

He took the stairs one at a time, almost 
starting to count them, but picked up a clothespin 
instead. He carried it to the landing and set it 
down on the top rim of the milkchute. 

Out back, the garage door was locked, the key 
out of sight. The lawnmower was wrapped 
in oily canvas, the patio chairs stacked 
in the corner, the awning rolled, the chipped 
white basin still half full of sand for grandchildren. 
The red shovel, his own, there on its nail 
for fifty years. He lowered the door 
and headed for the house, wondering if anyone 
saw him, if he should wave.

On the sunporch, he opened the drapes 
and attached a timer to the radio. Two others.
One for the floorlamp at the foot of the stairs,
and the last, the guest-room reading light.
New bulbs for both.   

His parents' bedroom door was closed.
He wished he could keep it that way. Inside, 
the gooseneck lamp bent low over a saucer  
with a spoon upside down in a dried puddle.
A small brown bottle stood close to its cap, 
its label toward the wall.              
He made the bed and hung his father's robe
on the back of the closet door. The armoire 

Was locked. The strongbox was safe  
on the bottom shelf, its key in the sock drawer.                  
There was more than he'd supposed, but he took it 
all, filling the suitcase with deeds and stocks, 
wills and bonds. He closed 

  the double doors and locked them. 
He sat on the bed and started to give in 
to everything around him, but shook it off                   
and went to his mother's side of the room.  Things
were in order. She'd probably stayed awake
that last night, tidying and sorting, 
vaguely agreeable, unaware she was walking
through the house for the last time.

He could see the backyard from their window.
It was filling up with snow. He emptied both
drawers of jewelry into a second suitcase and sat 
on the bed. He lay back and let it come, all 
the summer visits he'd spent there, the talks 
with his father, the papers that would take over 
at his death: what would become of Mother, 
the house, the land. 

There was a washcloth next to the sink 
and he soaked it. He buried his face in it. 
He wrung it out and took a towel 
from the linen closet. He left the cloth to dry 
on the edge of the tub and dropped the towel 
down the laundry chute, 
wondering what would become of it. 
It fits his hand as it had his father's 
hand, extra lead stashed inside 
beneath a rubber-plug eraser; he'd worn it 
clipped in his vest pocket, its arrow, 
gold and etched, catching light 
as it came toward his desk. 

Stolen once from the mantle, 
by stick-burglars as we slept, it showed 
up at the local precinct, flicking light 

  from the captain's badge-pocket 
  as he leaned back in his chair. 

After that, it stayed upstairs at night, 
weighing lightly down the clean white 
handkerchiefs Mother starched and ironed 
and stacked in the chifforobe drawer. 

The vests are gone, left in plastic bags 
with their suits in the Salvation Army shed 
at the edge of town, but if the men 
who wear them now ever pull the pockets 
inside out, they'll find no marks; 
he always turned back the lead. 

In the strongbox, there are penciled notes, 
rough drafts to the bank and hospital: 
something about his pension, directions 
forbidding the removal of his larynx, and one 
which reads in part: 

"If I am the first to go, Kathleen, 
it is important for you to know, 
that we haven't any debts 
other than the normal monthly bills. 
We have no debts of any kind. 
I have not authorized 
any delivery of goods or services."
It is always the same: he is far upstate 
where the roofs and lawns 
are collecting snow. 

The sunporch light 
is holding his father's profile 
to the window. His mother 
is turning away 
from the oval frame of the front door. 

He hurries away unseen, 
feeling he has business farther down 
the block, but stops at the edge 
of the next driveway and goes back, 
taking the privet hedge 
in one leap, dragging the left foot 
as he used to do in the high hurdles 
at the cinder track 
on the other side of town. 

He lands close to the drain vent, its cap 
an inch or two above the grass; 
he kneels and sees it is the same 
perforated lid he scarred on Saturdays 
with the handmower. 

He taps at the window 
next to his father's chair and reads 
his lips as he mouths the nickname he used 
for a lifetime. He puts his hand 
flat to the glass, expecting his father 
to do the same, measuring hand 
to hand, but his hand is alone, the fingers 
feeling the grit that swirls in the air 
in that part of the country. 

He looks deep into the house. The rooms 
are empty. His father's head is cut 
from cardboard and stuck to the glass. 
A single dab of flour paste, still wet 
as milk, begins its run 
down the cold clear pane between them.
The fresh drifts slant like poured salt 
against the picket fence. Voices, 
familiar to the room, suggest 
an earlier season: 

                      There is a man bent to his garden, 
                      the first warmth come early 
                      to his back, muscular 
                      as the earth he kneels in. 

                      Across the lawn, her left hand 
                      cupped like a vase, a woman 
                      gathers lilies of the valley, each bell 
                      ringing to her touch. 

And then they are gone. Nothing 
but birds at the kitchen window, three 
of them perched in twin evergreens, 
fluttering snow from the heavy branches. 
He used to wrestle it up 
the side of the house with his son; 
leaning from ladders, hand over hand 
they'd go, a rung at a time, 
the bulk of canvas collapsing at last 
into its storage box for the winter: 
that warehouse coffin of a thing 
nailed to the clapboards and studs 
high against the outside wall. 

And then his grandson took his place 
while he, cardiac arms overhead, stood 
stiff on a patio chair 
beginning the roll, until he was left 
below, turning the air between us, 
the green cracked cloth getting away 
from him, the silver bars caging him in 
from the sky, the silver bars 
naked to the autumn heat come to tease 
him toward a season he would never need 
an awning for, an awning whose shade 
would be given away to strangers 
none of us would ever know. 
He dials his dead father's house  
where timers go off at noon, at dusk,
at nine, allowing the gooseneck lamp 
to come on in the den, the radio                    

  to sift through the kitchen walls 
  and awaken the neighbor's dog,    
who no longer waits at the side door  
for scraps.

Six rings -- Mother 
would have answered by now, 
but she's kept in a vest that is tied 

  to a chair in the rest home he chose 
  from a list when he was in town.

Twenty rings, and counting:
the pilot light flickers in the stove,  
a cobweb undulates                      

  imperceptibly above the sink, the crystal 
  stemware chimes in its breakfront. 
He closes his eyes and listens.  
He would like to say something,
but there is nowhere 
to begin.
O, Father, 
there on the tallest star, 
I promised you too much 
for my own good. I cannot go 
daily to your wife. 

I try, instead, to stop by 
once a week to wheel her down 
the double ramps in time 
for lunch, if I'm intact enough 
to get beyond my own impending age 
which closes in like winter chill 
about my legs. 

She is in great comfort: fed 
well, bathed lovingly, talked to 
and watched, given flowers 
to arrange and plants to keep 
alive. I am never 

Her son; sometimes a brother, 
a schoolmate whose name 
she can't recall, and once, 
a month ago, I spent an hour 
as her father. She thinks 
she is at home, that you 
are about to enter every door.
He backs out the nails 
but the railings hold fast, ingrown 
on the tracks of a ruined oak 
rising half dead on the moonlit side 
of the lawn. 

On a crisscross of scraps and tenpenny nails, 
he finds the initials they carved without him 
in the glare of a dimestore lantern 
long gone from the hook 
that gives way at his touch. 

He dismantles it all, piece by piece, 
sailing each hunk to the foot 
of the ladder strapped to the tree. 

The roof has worn away; 
only a strip of canvas puckers along 
its hem of tacks; he takes them 
one at a time. 

Finished, he climbs down and sits 
on the boulder he used to hope 
they would miss 
if they fell from their sleep. 

He looks up at too many branches, 
too much sky, and begins 
to do what he taught them to do 
when they begged for a place 
of their own in the leaves. 

He collects all the wood 
he can hold and goes back up 
to rebuild the past: each board 
falling into place, its nails returned 
without question. 

At midnight, he unties the ladder 
and lets it slide away to the ground; 
he lies flat out, extending his arms 
and legs, until he is touching 
the trunks of four oaks, 
spread-eagle in the middle of the night.
Supper tonight was served by strangers 
in a truckstop far from the kitchen sink 
where his mother stood watching him back out 
over gravel, too close to the oak he scraped 
more than once on those late nights they warned 
him about. Perhaps he's had enough. 

His room is fast becoming a shrine: clean linen, 
homework arranged near his books, fresh flowers 
at the door, new pajamas folded at the pillow 

  he should come home to, and the lamp: its limp Christ, 
  with a 7 1/2 watt candle in His fist, nailed 
to the window jamb. 

The father wakens in the night and carries a drink 
upstairs to disturb the room. He feels the bed, 
empty in the half-light. He flicks off the lamp 
and studies the shapes of his son's belongings, 
hoping to find things missing, but they are there. 

The B-29 they built together 
holds on to the sky by a thumbtack the size 

  of a button on a puffcoat, the one his son wore 
  the last time he saw him slamming out 
through the pantry, his answer cut off 
by the banging of the door. 

He needs another drink, but lies down 
instead, his head sinking in 
where his son's should be. In what approximates 
sleep, he hears a voice behind the bed. 
He rouses to speak his name, to coax him back home, 
but sunlight comes to wash it all away.

He scatters the homework and curses his wife 
and her fastidious shrine. Downstairs 
it is the same. No one will look at him. They know 
he's been drinking. He leaves them alone 
and goes off to his den, to his tall window, 
his son behind the mower, the hedge 
fencing him in on three sides. But it is only 
a tree moving in the snow. 

He hears his wife and daughter in the hall, 
their quiet voices keeping the walls from falling in. 
They shout Goodbye and leave for the day. 
He feels better already. He pours himself a drink 
and heads for the yard, in search of kindling 
felled by the winds that worked all night. He sets 
the empty glass at the edge of the woods and goes in. 

Loaded to the chin, he comes to the front 
of the garage and lays a fire as his son would 
have it: twigs tangled like a bird's nest, 
sticks forming an open box, and narrow limbs 
the size of rake handles to finish it off right 
in the middle of the driveway. 

Inside for a clean glass, bourbon, and ice. 
And then the flame: the first strike does it. 
The kitchen match goes white and orange and blue. 
But he is gone, back inside, 

Upstairs at the window, jamming the storm sash up 
as far as it goes. And now it begins. Here come 
the pillows and sheets and blanket. A shelf wrenched 
from the closet wall. The straightback chair 
breaks when it hits the cement. The desk 
is too big and takes the windowframe with it: 
glass and putty sailing like ice and snow. 
The single mattress bounces when it hits. The box 
spring cracks once and falls to its side. 

And now a wait while the rug is rolled 
and lowered by its fringe. 

Here, the pajamas unfolding. Homework flying 
like kites, books by the dozen flapping 
to the ground. The model plane is off its tack, 
heading for the fire. 

Drawers and their sweaters are on their way, 
a closet floor of shoes and boots, shirts, jeans 
by the armful, jackets and ties, two stereo speakers, 
a double rack of albums, lacrosse sticks 
and helmet, bedsides and headboards, a clock 
trailing its cord, a hockey stick and floor lamp 
with shade still attached, a calendar 
turning its month over at last. 
She felt the snowfield break beneath her boots, 
heard the boom as the fracture spread eight, nine 
hundred yards left and right across the ridge. 

She remembered to drop her poles and kick off 
her skis; she even tried swimming awhile, 
but started to gag and rolled herself up, 
her face tight in her mittens, the roar 
working to cram her mouth and nostrils full of snow, 
half the mountain slamming downhill, uprooting 
trees, boulders, line-shacks, turning the night 
inside out, over and over again, 

Until it all settled in the dark she felt 
coming to a stop around her. She remembers the chapter 
on Fright and Self Control, and takes tiny helpings 
of air trapped in the space her mittens made. 

She has no idea which way is up. It is 
darker in there than in the childhood dream 
where something white was always at the window. 
Now, there is no window, only tons of snow 
packed hard against her, front and back, 
like king-sized mattresses piled high 
for the storybook princess and the pea. 

She must not pass out; she knows snow is porous 
enough to keep her alive, but can almost feel 
the ice mask forming across her face, the breath's 
own handiwork of shallow sleep. 

If she is to survive, she must now force saliva 
between her lips. If it heads for her chin, escape 
is above; if not, she may panic and die 
upside down by herself, 
the acceleration of nerves, the state of being 
scared to death. 

She lucks out. Up is up! 
She tries to come out of her bend, 
and feels the slightest give along the curve 
of her body. It could be an air space. There are 
such things -- some the size of root cellars: hard 
slabs of snow tumbled together like a house of cards. 

She turns and finds she can move her head; leaning, 
digging with her elbow, she drops off 
to the left, like falling out of bed. 

She stands on a slanting floor in the blackest dark 
she has ever been in. She begins 
feeling her way around her cell, and something 
flaps across her face. She grabs at it 
and holds on, hoping it is still intact. It 
is the avalanche cord, orange and long, that unfurled 
from its cannister on impact 
when she belly-flopped at the top of the mountain. 
She is hooked to it and has to believe the other end 
is where it belongs: waving merrily above her grave. 

They will find her soon, she is sure, headlamps flicking 
across the terrain; they will tug at her cord, 
signalling as they probe and dig. She continues along 
the wall, getting the contour of the place. 
There are alleyways everywhere, but they may be 
dead ends; besides, she wants her cord 
to have all the slack it needs. 

On the nearest block, she finds a tilted shelf 
of torn ice, beneath it: a frond of hemlock; she eases it 
out, hoping it is still attached, but it comes off 
in her hand. She sets it aside and becomes aware 
of the fragrance filling the room. 

She squats and closes her eyes, as if 
she were in the forest after a good downhill run, 
and thinks: Perhaps she can tunnel to a tree; 
perhaps there will be a door there, hinged 
by elves. "Grendel" she says aloud. "Mab, Lizard 
Leg, Horse-Nettle. " 

But she has missed the password; nothing opens 
anywhere. She laughs at herself and shakes her head. 
What to do. Her rucksack is gone, ripped off 
up top. She could use something to eat. 
She has pockets everywhere, zippers, buttons, snaps, 
but she comes up empty, 
except for car keys and a penlight 
dead on its chain. 

She knows there is air for a day or more, 
and remembers the boy in Norway buried for a week. 

  She wants to eat snow but doesn't want cramps. 
  She wants to dig but thinks of cave-ins. 
She needs to scream but no one will hear. 

It's high in her chest, something 
like the ache from running too hard too long 
before you run through it and out 
the other side. She lets it come on. 

It's as though she's been scolded and sent 
to her room. She takes off her mittens and goes 
to her knees to fill each with snow. "Bad girl" 
she says and hurls her mittens away, starting to sob 
only a little, mumbling frightened things. 

And then the right foot. She stands 
and stomps the snow, running her fingers up 
the avalanche cord, still safe in the air 
where it hangs. "Mustn't pull. Good girl. Mustn't 
pull." And she starts 
reeling it in, an inch at a time, allowing 
the orange ribbon to slip through the roof 
like a thread from her mother's hem, 
curling at her feet, the last of it fluttering 
across her face and down her arms. 

She sits and finds the end of the cord. She puts it 
to her thumb and starts rolling it up, 'round and 'round, 
neat as a pin it goes, a giant thimble growing 
in the dark. But she tires of her game and crawls away 
in a widening circle in search of the hemlock branch. 
She buries her face in it and strips a handful 
of needles, rubbing them between her palms, inhaling 
the sweet sticky smear she has made of herself. 

She plants the rest of the branch upright 
in the floor, and lies down to face it, patting 
the snow, telling it things, crossing 
and uncrossing her legs behind her. 

She saw him arrive in a jumble of fire, a wee 
bit of a thing on the lowest limb. He wore 
a green jerkin with hollow stone buttons and knickers 
puffed to the bands. She started to hum 
to see if he'd dance in his circle of light, 
and the jig that he did made her laugh in a giggle 
inside. She watched him kick at the base of the tree 
and bark fall away from the door. 

With his hat held aloft and a sweep of his arm, 
he bade her Good Day and Come In. It was in half light 
she climbed, hand over hand, the elf 
urging her on from behind; up, up 
to the uppermost rung 
to a four-legged chair and a window of sticks 
tied together with vines, and a view 
of the snowfield below. 

They were there, starting the scuffline by moonlight, 
wands marking the turn where the ski pole appeared. 
She is tired from climbing and wants to sleep; 
she will call to them later, after they find 
whatever it is they lost.
The woman behind the loan desk says No 
for the last time and waits for him to leave. 
He stands and makes sure his sleeve 
brushes against a stack of file folders, 
leaving a clutter of paper at her feet; 
he doesn't look back.

Out on the steps, he hears the guard 
locking the doors behind him. Three o'clock. 
He buttons the only button left on his coat 
and straightens the paperclip he took 
when her back was turned. He sticks it 
in his collar, feeding it 
through the flap on the other side, 
twisting it back on itself, 
against the wind, before heading north 
along the tracks. 

The rain has turned to sleet, and he looks 
for a stopping place. A tavern roof rises close 
to the roadbed, but he knows 
he's not welcome there. 

He takes the wad of deposit slips he stole 
from the glass bin and lets it fly, 
dozens of giant flakes 
coming back in his face, a few settling off 
to his left, dark down the sloping gravel 
where the stagnant water waits. 

He's soaking through but can almost see 
the tunnel beneath the interstate; if no one 
is there, he can get a few minutes rest. 
It's no place to stay too long; beatings 
are as common as dogs. 

He tries taking two ties at a time, 
but settles for a shorter stride, squinting 
his way to the underpass. 

The walls are wet from seepage, but he's safe 

from sleet. He squats on the foot-ledge 
and pulls his arms close to his chest, blowing 
into one fist and then the other, his cheeks 
puffed and blotched, his toes working themselves 
like fingers in wet mittens, the girders 
rumbling overhead under the weight 
of holiday traffic leaving the city. 
He's tempted to stay the night 

But hears them in time to make a run for it, 
three toughs heading home for supper, shouting 
him out, swearing to take his shoes 
the next time they catch him napping. 

He stops beyond the bend and sits down 
on the track, the same roadbed, the same 
water, blacker in the dusk. He hears 
the train downtrack, the engine light closing in. 

He decides to get out of the way in time 
to watch the commuters 
dry behind glass. He feels for the largest stone 
he can find, and holds it lightly, ready 
to shatter a window, but lets it fall 
down the ravine, the caboose trailing 
its red lantern, pitching him back into darkness. 

He sits on the rail trembling 
beneath him, the sleet becoming snow. He curls 
out his tongue, allowing flake 
after flake to land and dissolve; others stay 
whole on his eyelids, closed against the sky. 

He wishes he had gloves 
and a pair of buckle boots -- the ones 
he had when he was growing up, when 
his mother would turn them half inside out 
to warm over the register. 

He can feel the flannel lining, the gloves 
supple and light on his hands, 
the new smell of leather 
that means everything.
He obeys his holy orders 
and parks at the convent wall, 
taking the path on the public side 
of the fence. Once inside, 

He heads through the trees 
to the chapel doors, where he uses the key 
that weighs heavy in his pocket all week long. 

He enters the confessional and waits 
for them to come: novices 
half his age, lastingly wed 
to their vows they seem 
anxious to pass their mild offenses 
through his forgiving hands, and to do 
what he says they must. 

He admits to having thoughts, but keeps them 
under control; he enjoys 
their supplication, rehearses what it is 
he says to them, but wonders 
if they ever wish they knew 
the man behind the cloth. 

He receives them each in turn, 
the youngest always last, innocent 
to a fault. He hears her leave in prayer, 
the residue of her voice filtered 
by the screen, the clean breath, 
the slightest touch of starch adrift 
in the dark 
his fingers long to explore.
At seven thousand feet, the underpinnings of clouds 
look more like wind-ice on a mountain lake, 
its mist working among the curls, the sun 
slanting its shadows toward Canada, as his last 
day on Earth opens its wings. 

His leather envelope made it through the gate 
with him; he holds it flat to his chest 
as the 727 banks hard to the left, avoiding those 
who hurt him most; he leans back, aware 
of the headrest crinkling behind him; he wonders 
whether the night crew changed the paper 
or if he's deep in dandruff or Vitalis 
or the female breath of hair rinse 
ready to fill his nostrils if he turns; perhaps 
a long blonde hair has already settled 
in his own; he keeps his hands to himself & sees 
the No Smoking sign still aglow; he smiles, 
remembering his room 

On West Seneca, the essentials laid out on the bed 
last night: upholstery thread tight on its spool, 
the plastic spoon he licked clean yesterday 
afternoon, two baggies of black powder, the socks 
they are flying in, & the ampule of mercuric 
fulminate that will blow them apart, but now waits 

  cool in its cotton mesh, safe in a Parker pen 
  whose sac of blue ink lies unplugged & limp 
in a dresser drawer he will never open again. 

His hands are on his lap, a scar 
on one knuckle where a hacksaw jumped his grip 
in his father's shop; it fades when he stretches it; 
he makes it disappear again before tasting 
the moisture forming on his palms: almost warm 
enough to detonate the ampule riding in his vest; 
he tries to recall the doubting Thomas who left 
a hand in Bomb School, but comes up with only half 
a name; he folds his fingers into fists 
& is bemused, thinking of them gone astray. 

He will distribute them soon, the brochures, 
simple in design: xeroxed back-to-back after 
hours, folded once, black letters on yellow stock, 
elite type, precise language; they will read 
how he learned as a boy in a cellar 
that chemicals do what they say they do; 
they will see the formula & wish themselves down 
behind trees or hillside where they might 
burrow & climb for their lives. 

By paragraph twelve he'll be holding the pilots 
at bay, having them squat at the cockpit walls, 
trying to find more distance from the ampule 
they watch slide from its pen to be lashed 
to the curve of the spoon, thread holding it open 
& bare for the heat his fingers & thumb 
are frantic to give. 

He wonders if some hero will make his move 

  & fail; the priest will mention Hellfire, a parent 
  her child, a son his mother dying in Sunnyside; 
some will say nothing at all as they read 
how the spoon will be laced to the baggies & stuffed 
overhead in the console 
to melt all controls to their pinnings 
when the ampule goes wild at his touch. 

The cabin sign is off; 
a stewardess is hustling drinks in First Class; 
he unbuckles himself & stands, 
adjusting the black powder socks that dangle 
from his belt; he unzips the envelope & removes 
the brochures; the stern man across the aisle 
accepts one & flicks on the overhead light; 
it is 8:13; they are due at La Guardia at nine.
The late June sun had come in the window 
over his mother's bed, and he used it 
to make shadows on the wall, but they came out 
looking like ropes, tight twisted things, 
wrapped around themselves. He flicked 
all ten fingers and closed them 
into fists, pressing knuckles to knuckles 
until they hurt, as they did 
when he'd fight in the schoolyard. 

They were big hands, like Grandfather Fitz's 
he'd been told, the man long dead, whose sepia eyes 
never closed as they stared him down 

  from the opposite corner, the oval portrait 
  leaning too close on its wire. 

He knew he shouldn't look below the frame 
at his sleeping mother, but he did, 
sometimes, and saw things. He did not 
enjoy seeing her nightgown hiked up 
to her hips when the sheet slipped away 
in the night. He wished he could yank it 
down, tuck it in, pin it tight 
to the binding running around the mattress. 

What he liked best was lying at first light, 
her long braid brown and inviting, 
almost touching the floor. But he grew 
afraid when once she half-roused 
and turned, a shoulder strap slack enough 
to reveal a breast, the only one 
he'd ever seen. He tried to remember 
nursing at it, wondering if he'd fondled 
the braid as he fed, if she caressed 
him in his nakedness. 


  But then he'd shut his eyes and turn
  to the wall, getting his face 
as close to it as he could, his left hand 
strained and flat against the cool blue plaster. 
Often, near morning, she would say things 
in dream, and he would cover his ears and hum 
until he heard nothing at all. 

And now, on this the last day 
he'd ever have to spend in grammar school, 
he lay awake in the room he'd always shared 
with her, and thought about 

His father far down the hall 
in his chamber, his bothersome snoring 
muffled from Mother's delicate sleep; 
his sister close on the other side 
of the wall, in the room he wanted 
for himself. He shut off the alarm 

Before it clanged and was relieved to find 
his mother wrapped, tangled, 
only a big toe jutting out for air 
in the narrow space between them. 

Downstairs, he smeared a piece of bread 
with apple butter and sat on the porch, 
remembering the summer morning his sister 
forced him to stay on the bottom step 
while she repeated the lie of a woman 
in a long black car who would soon be at the curb; 
she would wear a black dress and gloves 
and laced boots. She would take him away. 
He licked the last of the apple butter 
from his thumb and went off the back way, 
over the fence and down the path; 
he was late and stopped to get 
a scolding note from Sister Helena. 

When the last of all bells rang for the day, 
he opened his locker and stuck 
his copy of Ring magazine in his back pocket 
and took the leftover bottle 
of ink to smash against the brick wall 
rising high over the rectory window, someone 
yelling, promising there'd be hell to pay, 
calling him by name but in a voice that knew 
it was best to leave him alone. 

At the end of the block, 
he settled under a tree, the largest maple 
on the Town Hall lawn; he thought 
of it as his own and came to it 
on such days. He pulled 
his magazine out and uncurled it, Billy Conn 
on the cover, his cut-man taking the stool 
out of the corner, the ropes tight behind him, 
thick and twisted, wrapped in tape. 

The idea hit him like a quick jab: 
he could have a ring! The hardware store 
had clothesline. He slipped one inside his jacket 
and paid for the other two. And then home. 

No one was there, and he went to the cellar. 
He undid the clotheslines and looped 
the three ends around the first steel pole 
that supported the main beams of the house. 

And then the braiding: crossing the strands, 
as he'd seen his mother do a thousand times 
at her vanity, stopping
to straighten the snarls, to tighten
the loops; inch by inch it grew 
from pole to pole: the top rope 
of his own ring, his own place, 
the rope burns on his hands 
reminding him of the shadows on their wall 
this morning, Grandfather's eyes, 
his mother's long plaited hair 
half undone by sleep.

He wouldn't use tape; he wanted the strands 
as they were. The last knot tied, he slapped 
the rope and it almost sang back. 
He went to a neutral corner and saw Billy Conn 
coming at him. He circled to his left 
and kept away till the round was over. 

He stepped out of the ring and did 
some shadowboxing near the washtubs, 
banging away at the air, talking himself 
into a frenzy, taking a few shots to the head, 
the gut, moving away, jabbing, sticking, 
until he was soaking wet. 

The faucet squeaked when he turned it 
on full force, cold water drowning out 
everything, hands splashing it everywhere, 
his shirt and slacks and undershorts 

  peeled off, a bath towel stiff but dry 
  hanging from its nail near the stairs. 

Barefoot and naked, 
he stepped back under the rope 
to dry off in the ring, wrapping the towel 
tight at the waist, tucking it in, 
arms held overhead in victory. 

And then the army cot, folded 
within reach, to be snapped open 
and snugged up against the pole 
closest to the furnace, two full floors 
beneath Mother's bed. 

He stretched out on the taut canvas, 
his left arm across his face, 
the right finding the braided rope, 
curling his fingers around it, 
tightening his grip, running it slowly 
out and back as far as he could, his mouth 
going dry as he felt the strands rise 
and disappear in the palm of his hand.
His visits home are risings from the dead: 
the walk down Woodward from the depot, 
Kittie waiting at the doorstep, smoothing 
the clean white apron she starched 
and ironed an hour ago. 

There's always the unwinding, the hiding away 
of the suitcase as though he were going 
to stay, the toothbrush back in its circle 
at the sink, the hairbrush upside down 
on the shelf, the drapes thrown open 
in the far bedroom, closed off when he's gone. 

No matter the season, Fitz goes by himself 
alongside the barn to the stream he compares 
to a mile of track west of Galeton, the same 
dips and turns. He prefers the stream, 

But his crew's not there clearing the way 
for the 9:53 from Buffalo, waving it on 
before heading out to fix whatever 
it rattled loose 
between milepost #599 and #607. 

There'll be joints in need of shims, 
a dozen or more spikes riding up, a tie 
edging away from its stones; everything 
scrawled on a pad 
they hand him at quitting time. 

The stream is almost quiet. The rime 
that flared the willow is gone, the beards 
of ice thinning along the crags, one more winter 
giving up to thaw; it's good 

To be away from the gangshack awhile. 
He spends too much time in it 
staring through window dust, thinking
of his men, downtrack, taking a break, 
their tin cups in the canvas sack 
lashed to the handcar, the gallon of coffee 
tied thick with newspapers. He'd be with them 
if he could, but there's no going back 
from foreman to gandy. 

Sunday night he'll be back at The Inn 

  sharing another meal with boarders 
  he'd rather see passing on a train, 
and then the hours alone 
thinking letters he will never write: 

To Lyle at dental school to ease up 
on his work. To Kell at U.B. to lay off 
the parties. And Kathleen 
spending the last year of high school 
in an empty house with her mother. 

A small shelf of ice gives way 
at his feet. He watches it turn in place 
and head downstream. 

The night has come cold. He looks back 
toward the house and imagines Kittie 
calling him to bed, the patch of ice 
lost in the current some thirty ties away.
Linen napkins, spotless from the wash, starched 
and ironed, smelling like altar cloths. Olives 
and radishes wet in cut glass, a steaming gravy bowl 
attached to its platter, an iridescent pitcher cold 
with milk, the cream stirred in moments before. 

The serving fork, black bone at the handle, capped 
in steel, tines sharp as hatpins. Stuffed celery, 
cut in bite-sized bits, tomato juice flecked 

  with pepper, the vinegar cruet full to the stopper 
  catching light from the chandelier. 

Once-a-week corduroyed plates with yellow trim, 
a huge mound of potatoes mashed and swirled. 
Buttered corn, side salads topped with sliced tomatoes, 
a tall stack of bread, a quarter pound of butter 
warmed by its side. And chicken, falling off the bone: 
crisp skin baked sweet with ten-minute bastings. 

Homemade pies, chocolate mints and puddings, 
coffee and graceful glasses of water, chipped ice 
clinking the rims. 

Cashews in a silver scoop, the centerpiece a milkglass 
compote with caved-in sides, laced and hung 
with grapes, apples, and oranges for the taking.
doesn't complain anymore 
about her husband's late nights or drinking 
or, most especially, the way he left 
his pajamas on the bathroom floor 
when he'd come downstairs, freshly shaved 
and showered, ready for his day 
at the office where he died. 

She used to wave goodbye through the oval 
front door, and trudge upstairs 
to see if he'd remembered. She'd pick them up, 
wishing he were still in them, shaking 
them out, scolding him 
in a voice no more than a whisper. 

She'd fold them and tuck them 
under his pillow in the big double bed 
they'd shared for thirty years in the room 
over the parlor and its piano. 

She'd buy new ones once a year, 
grumbling about him 
right there in the men's department, 
deciding on a style that seemed young, never 
grey, usually without buttons, and always 
summer-weight and tall. 

The pair she bought last Thursday had blue 
stripes. She had them gift-wrapped 
in the store's silver foil and took them 
home where she left them 
on the edge of the bed he'd slept in 
for the last time a month ago. 

After the local news and weather, 
she locked the cellar door and left 
the pantry bulb ablaze, 
to keep the shadows in their place, 
and went upstairs. 

The bedside lamp shed light 
on the box, waiting in its trim. 
She opened it and took the pajamas 
to her lap: the noisy sheet of tissue lost 
within the folds; sixteen more pins 
to add to the scrap of flannel she kept 
tacked above the sewing machine. 

She was pleased to find the inspection slips. 
Number four had checked the bottoms; number 
twelve had seen to the tops. 

He would have liked them. No buttons, bordered 
cuffs, four snaps on the fly, and enough room 
in the seat to turn over 
and over in his sleep. 

His pillow was where it belonged. 
She laid the pajamas full length along his side 
of the bed, the left leg bent at the knee, 
where she could feel it on her back, if he were there. 

Come morning, she will drop them 
on the bathroom floor on her way downstairs. 

The neighbor children won't notice her 
waving from the door, but when the school bus leaves, 
she will close the curtains and go back 
upstairs to find 
what she knows she will find, and take them 
in her arms.
The bottom sweater button 
is in the next to bottom hole, 
and his mother's fingers almost 
find it out, but climb instead 
to the polished head of a brooch: 
a maiden blushing to the left, hair 
falling across a shoulder 
bared in sunlight. 

Something about the eyes tells her 
she should know him, perhaps 
the young man who brings her groceries 
or Father Sullivan 
dressed for a day off. 

But no. The voice is more comfortable 
than that; it fits the neighborhood. 
His hair is going grey; tanned, 
he must spend time along the lake. 
The eyes react 

  as her father's would: cut glass 
  catching light 

Shed by a flowered bulb in the ceiling 
where they stand stopped 
in the upstairs hall, she 
at her bedroom door; her married son 
nearer the guest room, a step away, 
dressed from the shower 
hardly used since he lived at home. 

She'd like to have a towel 
from the linen closet, one of the long 
fluffy ones they used to save for company, 
and wrap it 'round his head, the way 
his mother must have done 
before he grew so tall. 

He seems familiar, 

  but she can't believe the name 
  he used for her. 

She takes his arm 
and turns his face up 
toward the light, as mothers do, 
and finally asks the question: 
Whose boy are you?
She wakens, to an attic room 
whose curtains have gone limp with rain. 
The rosary beads that helped her turn 
to sleep still lie half-said 
across her flannel gown. 

If she could lift her head 
enough to see beyond the sill, she'd know, 
she thinks, what place she's in. 
Which means, perhaps, she's not at home, 
for if she is where is the sash 
she pulls on when she needs to sit 
for meals or evening prayers? 

And what about the ceiling? 
Those squares are nothing like they are 
at home. Although she can't recall 
quite what they ought to be, she knows 
these aren't the same. Why, what if 
they begin to fall? What if 
she counts them, row by row, and has 
an extra number when she's through? 
Why would anyone paste a ceiling up 
like that? Where are the nails? 

It must be winter still. She'll ask 
for another blanket when they bring her 
toast and tea. Up on an elbow, 
her woolen robe just out of reach, she sees 
the maple start its contradiction: 
its closest branch full-leaf and bowing 
against the window screen. 

Back deep in her pillow, she decides 
to close her eyes to see if she can figure 
out how long and who and when and where, 
but drifts away instead to watch the specks 
dart beneath her lids. She moves her eyes 
from side to side and finds a summer sky, 
and sleeps beneath it. 
She doesn't hear her lunch arrive, but is shaken 
awake to drink her medication and to be cranked  
uptight for the tray; she bibs her napkin
and takes a spoon to her tea in near silence. 

She's hoped for purple finches and gets them, 
two by two at the window ledge, poking 
around in the spillage of thistle and millet, 
cracked corn and shucks of sunflower seeds. 

Then up to the feeder they go, held somehow 
to the glass, and she watches them holding on 
in midair, the others waiting in hemlocks 
on the far side of the wall. 

One finch looks in on her, 
tilts its dull raspberry head and is gone, 
its mate intent on the meal, a bold 
pale eyebrow underscoring the crown. 

She would like to see their nest: 
a scoop of grass and twigs, usually lined 
with hair, often her own, back when 
she'd yank the barn rope, rocking the rain barrel 
on its swivel, drenching herself 
in the afternoon sun, toweling and combing, 
brushing and drying 
on the wide flat lawn. 

There were hemlocks then, and willows 
along the brook, where the birds fed themselves, 
as they are doing now, newcomers, 
only an arm's length from her bed, 
where she strains in a harness of cloth 
to see them landing on the sill. 
He'd find them among fallen limbs and brush 
in the pitiful stretch of trees 
they call their woods: stones the size 
of grapefruits, lugged out to the driveway 
to be washed off with the garden hose 
and left to bake on the blacktop 
in the high sun before being tucked away 
in the trunk of the car, along the sides, 
some down in the well, snug against the spare 
held fast by the stretch-strap doubling 
as the tire-iron brace, a four-pronged plus sign 
looking more like a silver cross the way 
it is propped, as though its Christ had fallen 
off, perhaps still there laid out 
among the stones. 

Headed for Buffalo, the outskirts, 
the homestead where there were no rocks 
to line the rose garden, houses no more 
than a car's width away from the next, 
the narrow concrete tilting 
toward Bannigan's front porch. 

And his parents would be there, pacing 
the sunporch, waiting for the visit to begin: 
five days of clutter and talk, sleeping bags 
and diapers, suitcases, books, 
hanging clothes, shopping bags; space enough 
in the guest room. 

And then the stones, last, always 
last: a few at a time; each placed 
ceremoniously along the rim of the rose garden 
that curled against the side of the garage 
to the back picket fence, turning left 
at the Broderson's shed and back 
toward the house. 

Father is dead; Mother is gone, and soon 
strangers will be moving in. But the stones 
are still there, years of stones. Last night 
he went off alone to do something about that. 
He took only the three-inch paintbrush saved 
from his father's workbench, one 
of a dozen washed after every use, never 
to be thrown away, clean in its plastic pouch, 
the snap still intact. 

Seven hours by train, a short walk 
to the Delaware bus, twenty minutes to the city 
line. He gets off a stop early and crosses 
the street to the hardware store; the name 
has changed, common as a tenpenny nail. 

He chooses a gallon of black enamel 
and feels the plank floor shudder 
beneath him as the vibrator-stand 
shakes the can to a blur on the counter. 

        His mother's hands are shaking in her room, some 
        400 miles downstate; if she had lids on the cups 
        she would spill less tea on her sweaters and robe. 
        He may suggest it to the home. 

        Now, at 10:30 in the morning, she is saying 
        her first rosary of the day, the floor nurse leading 

          her on, bead by bead, as the 
  paint slaps against its lid 
          only a block away from the altar rail 
        where she knelt for half a lifetime. 

        She doesn't know 
        what she is doing; she is seventeen again: 
        Springville, her brothers bringing her candies, Papa 
        home on weekends from the railroad gang, 
        her mother, rosary in hand at bedtime, and Kathleen 
        sleeping with her own beads under her pillow, 
        the same rosary she holds in her grape-veined hands 
        this morning, a day's journey from where he stands 
        waiting for his twenty-dollar bill to be broken. 

        She is alone for the first time in weeks: 
        the nurse has left to check on a noise in the hall, 
        and Mother goes on inventing melodies and words 
        to replace the orthodox prayers once her own. 
        In her wheelchair, the canvas waistband tight 
        as a saint's hairshirt, she feels 
        the beads loose in her hand. She fingers them, 
        their roundness, small as pebbles, smaller 
        than the stones her son has gone to see again. 

        She is drawn to the beads, sensing nourishment. 
        Her lips are moving in prayers 
        never heard before; her tongue is extended, her eyes 

          closed. She bends closer to 
  the beads, accepting 
          them now like the host safe in her mouth, sliding 
        slowly as forgiveness on the same saliva 
        the aides dab away with tissues. 

        But now, it serves her well: for the beads 

          have slipped fully beyond the 
  lips; they could 
          be green peas all in a row tumbling from a spoon, 
        beginning their descent. No pain. No outcry; 
        she is deep in a tangled meditation; only 
        the crucifix is left dangling against her chin, 
        its small silver link holding fast to the first 
        of its fifty-nine beads. 

        Christ is in His diaper and the thorns are intact; 
        He is swaying slightly swaying, His features 
        rubbed away by Mother's mothering. They retrieve 
        the rosary and dry it well enough 
        for her to go on to the next decade, the connected beads 
        back where they belong: in the tiny palm 
        that waited like a cradle or a font 
        or a crypt dark behind a large washed stone.

The paint can is freed from its shaking. He takes 
the gallon as it is, swinging on its wire handle, 
and drops the change in his side pocket. 

The town seems almost the same: the village hall, 
the playground at the corner, Kay's Drugstore 
bought out and revamped from counter 
to name. The sun is hot as he turns down Lincoln 
Boulevard. The house is vacant; he decides 
not to use the spare key for any last look. 

The backyard is his grotto and he goes to it. 
The stones are still in their looped line 
skirting the edge of the rose garden. He stands 
frozen in place. He wants all of the stones; 
he wants to take them back to the ground he walks 
every evening, the frail run of trees 
that flanks his house. 

He feels for his rosary and finds it 
in his suitcoat pocket, kept there for good luck. 
He takes out the beads on barstools sometimes, 
to fondle them in the dim light, saying 
their prayers half in a trance, and in churches 
he needs to find when he is alone on the road, 
cities he doesn't want to see ever again. 

The stones must stay. And so he begins: 
within minutes they are laid out 
in a wide circle. Some of them tipping, a few 
already out of ranks, but each assigned a plot 
of ground: the paternosters, the aves, 
the tenth aves each doubling as a Gloria Patri. 

The shrubbery encircling the yard is thick 
enough to hide him from the neighbors. He stands 
at the back of the lawn, at the strand of beadstones 
which must stray from the others so that he 
might affix the crucifix-stone to its tip. 
He knew back home which stone it must be: 
the one with the purple vein running around 
its middle, and it is there. 

He loosens the lid of the gallon 
with the half dollar he brought from his dresser 
drawer, the chifforobe which once stood 
in his father's room and now holds his own socks 
and shirts and bonds and bills. The paint 
is rich, the brush still soft; he can smell 
the turpentine on the bristles, dry and stained 
deep with many colors far down in the base, 
each a different Saturday morning project done 
with his father on this property, before the stones, 
before almost anything. 

He kneels at the first stone and grabs too quickly, 
anxious to see the purple run of color, and jams 
his thumb, blood forming already beneath the nail. 
He replaces the stone and paints a rough cross 
on it, trying to leave the vein purple 
as a cinch for the stipe. He takes a giant step 
to where the next stone lies: the paint 
goes on with hardly a trace of dirt; another 
step and he is past The Lord's Prayer, onto the first 

  trio of aves: the Hail Marys, one like the next. 
  The black is as lush as the counterman 
said it would be. 

Another single bead, and he finds himself 
praying aloud, loud enough only for a stone 
to hear. Another space and then on to the flat slab 
of sandstone he knew he would use 
to connect the circle of decades. He gives it 
two brush strokes, unbroken, 
a child's attempt at the ancient fish, good enough 
for anyone who knows. 

Three spaces beyond the fish lies a speckled stone; 
it goes black, flush to the grass. Nine more 
go quickly, slopping the paint in a blob 
on top, all at once, scampering back 
and forth to smooth out the drippage, ripping away 
the blades of grass 
that are stained, stuffing them in his back pockets. 
He says the prayers as he paints his way 
through the next ten; one has a bit of moss 
from the shaded area along the spilloff spout 
on the garage roof, the others bare 
as the edge of grave markers. 

It takes three Hail Marys to paint 
a hail mary, the phrase "blessed art thou among women" 
the line that slows him down: he finds himself 
repeating it, remembering the pitchers 
of lemonade Mother would leave in the shade 
with chipped ice and a tall glass when he 
would use the handmower on a hot day. 

He is rubbing the grass now, the way 
he did when he was a boy, after cutting it twice, 
once fence to drive and, again, from garden 
to house. He would sit and sip from the sweating glass; 
the grass, the smell, the silent creatures 
he'd disturbed, all 

  holier and cleaner than the wood trimming 
  the stations of the cross in the church a block away 
over the back fence. He runs his hand 
across the grass until it hits his leg 
and wakes him to his task. 

Decade two. The stones are dusty and pitted. 
It all takes too long and he wonders 
if the weather will hold. He crawls on 
to The Lord's Prayer, three spaces away; he smiles 
as he comes to the words, "Those who trespass," 
and looks over his shoulder toward a space 
in the hedge, but knows that 
what he is doing is his to do. 

The third and fourth are almost too much. 
The paint needs stirring, the brush is filled 
with dirt; his time is running out. If 
he were to show anyone a decade, it would not be 
either of these. The paint is too thick, the grass 
too black, the stone-face showing through too often. 

He must finish and get away; he feels it 
in his wrists and ankles. He wonders if he should 
have come at all. His thumb, 
with its nail blood dried black, is numbing. 
He needs to be home, close to his own 
ring of stones at the far end of the property 
where he can sit and poke at the mild fires 
he builds there, feeding the flames 
with twigs and branches fallen on their own, 
the rocks large enough not to split from the heat, 
high enough to contain the blaze. 

But it is time for his best work. 
The paint goes on like cream, as thick 
as the cream that came 
in the bulb-topped bottles of the forties 
that the milkman would leave in the back hall 
during the war if they'd remember to prop 
the shirtcard cow in the window alongside 
the sign for the iceman and breadman, 

Smooth as the blade of grass he holds still 
between his lips, thin and slick, not a blade 
to crush between thumbs 
to make an unseemly noise, not one that would grow 
in a back lot, but one like all the others 
in this yard, planted by Father, tended 
by Father, watered by Father at dusk while other lawns 
went to seed and crabgrass and weed no one 
could name. It tastes good and clean and cool. 

And now it is done. The last beadrock black 
as the pieces of coal he was allowed to pitch 
into the yawning furnace, 
when Father would bank the fire, 
at nine-thirty every night, so that they could awaken 
in Lake Erie winters to heat rising from the floor grids. 

He looks back at the house, up 
at the window where the afternoon light 
is spreading its daily shadow across the corner 
of the small blue room he'd shared with his mother. 

He goes to his knees and puts the lid back 
on the empty can. He wipes the brush across the label, 
the brand name, the directions, the cautions, 
cleaning the bristles as best he can. He will 
finish the job as his father would have him do, 
but not here; back home, at his own bench 
in his own garage, where he belongs. 

He slips the brush into its plastic sleeve 
and drops it carefully into his inside suitcoat 
pocket and walks to the corner of the house 
where the same garbage cans wait hidden 
behind the spruce trees. He lowers the container 
far down inside the first and heads for the street; 
he does not look back. 

He has his wallet, his ticket home, 
his father's brush. He is listening to the angelus 
tolling from the parish belfry: six o'clock. 
But there is something else, quieter than the bells 
calling the villagers to prayer, something 
closer. It is his mother's voice, restored, 
the same voice that used to call to him 
from the kitchen window; she is obeying the ringing 
of the bells; she is intoning the beads 
he has left in her name beneath the Niagara sky: 
the threat of rain diminished, a healing breeze 
from the distant river 
drying the rocks where they lie.

No act so elemental: to climb 
in silence, watching the cloudy distance 
gather the waters into an accumulation 
like thunder. Sky flowers 
at this altitude of summer, while below, 
at the base of the tower, Jeffrey, 
age three, knows very well how 
at the center of things he is (but 
he can't see this arc of lakes and mountains). 

Were this another kind of tower 
the sparks which pass between son 
and father could set the blackest sheets 
of fire cutting toward the hills. 
Such a device burns prints of the shadows 
cast by its own light in granite 
and concrete, marks skin with a red 
tracery of flowers where dark 
kimono dyes transmit the heat. 

When I was a kid, each time we 
crossed the Whitestone Bridge and saw 
Manhattan's towers, I knew the fear 
of the bomb. Few in Hiroshima 
remembered any noise. At Asona Park 
that night, explosions from fuel tanks, 
mirrored in the dark bay like fountains, 
excited the grieving children, cheered them: 
this, the fatal saving grace -- 

to perceive amid wreckage the momentarily 
beautiful. No one cried out 
though wounds and burns were general. 
One old man, haunted by whiteness, 
an egg-like fluid melting down 
his cheeks, asks politely for water. 
A month later, radiation sickness 
taints their blood, while 
in the ashes wild flowers bloom.
Winter keeps us inside. My wife 
tells me she is terrified 
of death: how everything vanishes 
and nothing you do can change this. 
Then today, warm weather. In a 
friend's four-seater, we fly 
north to Rampart, a village 
on the Yukon, a ghostly airstrip, cabins, 

dark chips against the snow; 
banking, heading south along the 
pipeline, I ask for the controls 
and find my fear of the ground 
taking us higher, up 
to cloud-level, where, in luminous mist 
I yield, easing us back toward 
rolling ridges of spruce, thousands 
of black-barbed brush-strokes on white paper. 

Suddenly Jeffrey leaps from his seat: 
"Hey ... Hey!" -- knowing first flight. 
At home again I say the shape a 
life can take can make the end 
less terrible. She says the 
thought of dying brings a shock 
to her body so bad she can't 
sustain it, if you could hold 

it steady in your mind you'd go mad.
Sickened by the recent loss of his son 
strafed to death on a train, 
he'd traveled west from Vienna. 
Mittersill, Austria under U.S. occupation, 
and Webern, just past sixty, 
a small man with a precise 
concern for order, thoughtful, 
religious, minutely alone: beyond 

the determinate chaos of his age 
-- dazed armies dragging themselves 
away from defeat -- he struggled to 
slow things down by making them 
happen quickly and be over, 
as if the violence he'd never 
witnessed pressed upon some black 
future no one could long for. 

At the home of his brother-in-law, 
a man he did not know well, 
likely a Nazi, whom two GI's 
that night had come to arrest, the composer 
stepped outside to smoke and walk about the yard. 
And as they marched Herr Martel out the door, 
a scuffle on the steps, one jittery kid 
bumps into Webern, shoots him through the chest. 

Like the retrograde motion of a film -- 
steel bouncing around his lungs, a fuming 
cloud sucked backward into a beaker -- an 
infant numbness spreads about the will. 
To age slowly in the perfecting of your skills 
takes the kind of luck I'd wish for you, friend- 
reader, if you'll pray for me. Ten years later 
the kid who'd shot him drank himself to death. 

Tied to the self a man can never shed 
such terrors, but listen: along a shady path 
which winds about this formal garden, 
bushes tamed, flowers beautifully affixed 
to rich dark soil, where even the pebbles 
we walk on, fragile chips of comfort, whisper 
his colors -- in this muted hollow our harshest step 
evokes the dissonant flush of cinnamon from the earth.
Together we stare at the map, 
a land so vast whole herds can 
vanish; each lake a lung. Angry, 
he is my father and my other 

self: his face comes forward 
with its three days' stubble. 
By night, the differences are harsh 
layers of cloth between us. We 

sit in the darkened cabin, pass 
a jug, and put the stain of 
wine upon our lips. Thirty years 
a wife and son are missing: 

how fragile my disinterest 
in such matters. Caribou -- come 
dissonant reports from 
far-off valleys. Cartridges and 

thunder. We men without holdings 
have to follow over the blue -- 
and orange-flowered tundra, crossing 
borders, urgent into what future? 

At dawn on a farther ridge they 
reappear in thousands like a mist 
whose eyes sprout crystal 
lichen, small buds and blooms of whiteness. 

That night I dream: between his ribs, 
translucent like stretched rawhide, 
the heart too is a map. A scar-line 
like barbed wire rides across 

one nipple. He stands beside 
his tethered dogs. The herd's dry 
bones excite a fine white 
ash above his moss-packed roof.
The boy on the beach, maybe 
ten, watches the waves come in. 

He was there before us, we've 
been here an hour, and it makes me 
remember Kansas. There's not much to do in 
Kansas, so you learn to be patient, 

to sit there and look at the sky 
till it answers back with your name. 

Then the day takes you into its 
vast impersonal mill. The wind 
blows over you and the fields 
listen, until life fills you up. 

What you glean at that age 
has no name, but it stays. 

So, today, in Mexico, I can sit and watch the 
boy watching the waves, the changing 
light, and nothing is happening -- a tern, 
a lolloping gull-and out there beyond 
the sky, the spider spinning and spinning 

the life which is here inside, 
and you just have to wait for it!
A tiny black square on the map 
with greenhouse tomatoes growing 
among the weeds, and children's 
drawings tacked to every wall. 
My friend and I sacked 
out and held each other close 
in the partial dark. 

Dozing, I remembered that for years 
there'd hung above my bed 
a delicate brown wash in sun 
and shade: Bacchus and Pan, a small 
girl's dream of summer. Bouncing 
and bouncing till the springs 
complained, I played among them 
rising and falling, my gusty self 
awash in wind and rain. 

Ghosts, and the promise of a sea 
long since departed, relics 
in the mirror as I speed away. 

And then I slept and dreamt the world 
had come and gone, 
and came to where Pan's candied 
pipes were playing. There, 
a little girl in pigtails, rising, 
falling under his sweet spell 
until she tumbled in a heap, 
dropping on soft pillows into sleep. 

How do I know the abandoned house 
is me, the breeze within the dream 
carrying ash, the clash of a screen 
door shutting? Spooked out of 
the settling cabin, I remember running 
back to the river, back to our canoe, 
a vacant swing still swinging, 
loose voices singing in the storm.
Now that we're here I can't 
believe I wanted to come: his 
stone-covered ground at the 
Christ-windowed church by the trunk- 
rooted tree near the sister pools 
on this rainforest coast of 
Maui -- Christmas '78 -- 
our thirteenth anniversary. 

Superstitious? ... No angel hovers 
near the spot, just a white 
horse in the next field Jeffrey 
wants to ride -- no way -- and his 
disappointment seals our day. 
Quickly we pack back into the car, 
Messiah fading from the radio, 
tourists in this life and the next: 

What do I know? I know 
a child of his was stolen once 
and once he mapped the whole of 
Yucatan by air. Well ... I've 
been there. Whatever we hold 
of the past is passing. Mist 
and rain, and beyond the 
crumbling sugar mill's remains 

the still volcano rising.
The light six inches up 
hovered like an aura. 

Rising before dawn, you 
pinned a five-foot serpent 

with a shovel, I 
chopped its head off. 

Dead skin and rattles salvaged, 
the meat we fried in butter. 

We said, "It tastes like chicken." 
Some stories never end. 

Last night a plastic replica 
unfolded into life in a dresser drawer. 

I felt its muscular 
fanged pressure bearing down. 

Now, bolder and more primitive, 
I'm coming back to what I once believed: 

this whole vast world extending 
through space is nothing, 

just a bubble on a stream, wash 
after wash of matter dissipating. 

Lifting the poisonous visage on my 
shovel, I fling it off among cacti: 

loop over loop a headless 
body writhing in the dirt.
Stuck on a sandstone ledge 
where -- god knows -- I should never 
have been, I remember starting 
to slip. For three days lost 
to my body, I sank toward the 
bottom of a pool where gray shapes 
splashed around me near the center 
of a fierce design. Deeper down 
the pool became a room: 

did the mind exude that eerie 
soft blue flame by which 
the walls could be read, 
here a bone, a shell, there 
an odd repeating element 
like the sun. Meanwhile my body 
lay -- skull cracked, face crusted, 
front teeth gone, male nurses 
adjusting the needles taped 

to my veins -- unconscious, away 
where Christ's bloody effigy sagged 
on St. Joseph's wall. And as the last 
light started to vacate that hole 
I met another self, there at the 
center: he drifted under my skin, 
breathed through my lungs and dreamed 
himself into my wounds. Like brother 
assassins, meeting and parting, 

we float in this vacuum forever.
The Cessna that flew me in 
skimming the coast 
banked around those 
rocky points of land and 
moved in close 
where a dead one was 
its flesh thrown up 
by the sea. We'd 
hoped for tusks 
but this bulk without a head 
a white suffused with brown 
too much to move, too dead 
to eat -- what's to be 
done with it? 
                   Like a compact 
car, you can't tell 
front from back. Seagulls 
probe for entry 
into its rotting entrails 
and I am appalled by the smell.
At Wales, to the west of the weather 
the islands crowd toward tomorrow. 
My Eskimo host, the 
postmaster, sports a digital 
watch and smokes as he talks: 
"I collect records. You 
pick up the phone, call 
Anchorage and have the 
albums you want within six days." 
At the tarpaper shack 
where he works an arrow on the wall 
pointing west says, "Russia 
30 Miles." He wears a 
wispy beard, a black moustache, 
black shoulder-length hair like me: 
Wales, Alaska-99783.
Seal for dinner, and after 
when cranes in a lopsided "V" 
honk over, someone 
runs outside and takes a shot.
Eight calendars on the walls, no 
plumbing. The bathtub stocked 
with laundry, Pampers, a rusted 
two-gallon can, towels, rags, Friskies, 
and that fancy oval makeup box: 
"Cardin." Here you sit 
on the plastic "Honey-pot" above 
a disposable plastic bag; but 
there are amenities: two stoves 
in the kitchen, radio, 
CB. For reading, National 
Geographic, Ski-Mobile, Newsweek, 
or the current catalog from Sears. 
Outside, the kids play soccer, 
basketball, climb on the 
roofs. Inside, the Eagles gloat 
"The Greeks Don't Want No 
Freaks" on the hi-fi.
Walrus, whale, and seal 
vertebrae and ribs -- bones of all 
sizes going back 
to the sand. 130 people 
on a spit of land 
in an arctic sea: how 
elemental it must 
be when winter closes in. 
But August's dull, a rainy 
fall. Come January: dogsleds, 
skiing, skating, snow- 
machines. Chop a hole 
in the ice and drop 
a line. Vent 
a snow-tunnel out to the street. 
No fragile enterprise 
under cold, shifting skies: snow 
is the Eskimo's element.
In the next town, Shish- 
maref, some sixty miles off 
you hear they bought a truck, paid 
double the purchase price 
to ship it in. Then 
just last week the son 
of the village mayor 
who didn't know about gears crashed 
into the town hall -- bad luck. 
This winter flying up 
to Shish from Nome, Walter's 
cousin went down in the hills: half 
a dozen people killed, never 
found her body or her 
baby's. There's a lady 
in that town, dug in the 
mound behind the village, found 
carved fossil ivory 
worth fifty thousand bucks.
I find my moods are 
jagged as the rocks. Today I climb 
through tundra to the ridge 
two hours toward the sun. A blessing 
on you snowbirds, arctic hare. There 
on a farther ridge -- radar -- 
a disc of silver rivaling the 
sun, staring at its double 
like a loaded gun across the strait. 
On a boulder I sit and muse. 
Away to the north a lagoon 
lies flat and gray. Those 
water-borne cliffs to the west: 
Siberia. Awed by this place 
the top of my head comes loose 
and tears assault my eyes. Hairy 
with impending ice-ages 
I see the past arriving at 
our shore: mammoths, mastodons, 
and man. All 
times are crowded into this 
small village, its 
magic, my privilege.
I stand by a tractor 
hitched to a flat-bed 
truck. On it a boat 
and in the boat brown 
plastic bags full of gear. 
Four people sit on the bags, 
two wearing holstered guns 
and one of them is White: 
someone who stayed. A large tan 
dog is hoisted up 
shivering with excitement 
at his luck 
as they drive off to camp.
I can name it: behind 
the Weyapuks' house, discarded 
among sand-grass, a large 
whale vertebra from that 
bowhead they got last spring. 
It must be 
twenty inches across the beam, 
a rich and creamy brown and 
nobody seems to claim it.
Next day, wind and mist. 
I lug my suitcase, sleeping 
bag, my whale bone 
to the air-strip. I seem 
to need another hand 
for this. Alone in the sheet-metal 
hangar I stand and wait 
listening through fog 
for the buzz of my plane 
two hours late. I love it 
here but I can't stay. 
My trip takes on a frame. 
I feel it going deeper 
like a dream, its 
salt in my pores. Flo Weyapuk said 
when I asked about that 
bone, a bit puzzled, a bit 
amused: "You found it. It's yours."
Climbing the ridge among cactus 
we watch the gritty town and gumball 
tourist cars. A man in that jail 
for a buck will give you a thrill, 
lurching from his cell 
with a drawn gun and a scowl. 

But my friend's young son, afraid 
of this tilted ground -- timid lamb -- 
holds out his stricken hands 
and shakes. Remember, Jon, 
that long unsettled night 
five years ago: we drank and talked -- 

what's friendship for? To move 
beyond the self. I felt 
you were a dying man. At four a.m. 
through empty streets I drove you home, 
and by the curb you held me hard 
and cried; unblessed by bourbon 

knowing that it was too late 
for sleep. Now it's your sweet 
blond diabetic son moves me 
toward tears, his frail-boned beauty 
like another of your heart-wrung 
poems, blood on a dusty street 

where the ghosts of men 
who could not name their fears 
so shot, each other down 
watch as the sun turns red and round 
and the cactus casts its thorny 
darkness to the ground.
    in my scraggly beard and the first 
sweat of the day glistening on my arms, 
I lay on a canvas cot, thinking of you 
and of another woman too raw for that land. 

Burnt flakes of shale, jeweled peppergrains 
of moletooth, limbbones packed in stone, 
a fence, a track through sagebrush, colors 
mute, regions of advanced decay: these 
inarticulate, inhuman cries are somehow mine. 

That August, back in the Village, 
an intimate catastrophe: 
your pale, cream-colored buttocks, lady. 
All the years haven't taken away 
what that day turned up missing. 

Given a life to spend, a bank of bones, 
two bodies tough as any blossoms, we 
took each other in hand. So this 
is what it means to live on earth: 

pressing warm skin within your skin, not 
tentative, not innocent, not knowing 

that would come later.
Chekhov, here's one story you 
didn't write: on a banker's 
estate, locked 
in one room without 
company, a man 
reads 
while outside 
the peasants grumble and debauch, 
the master gambles his fortune away, 
and so much blood is spilled 
the snow falls red 
all over Eastern Europe. 

                                  For years 
this continues: he reads 
the systematic philosophers, popular 
novelists of other centuries, 
lyric poets. Now the man 
is reading about beautiful women. 
He undresses and strides naked 
about the room, and as we watch 
he seems to age. His neat goatee 
lengthens, grizzles, his broad chest 
narrows, his face wrinkles, 
and his eyes grow round and hollow. 
Is this the parable: 
a man alone in a cell 
reading, while outside 
history 
chalks up another debacle? 

Fifteen years later 
bitter with what he's foreseen 
he renounces all claim 
and climbs out the window. 
Peasants are lined against the wall 
of the estate, and just as he hits the ground 
he notes a squad of soldiers aiming their guns. 
Crouching, he scrambles for cover. 
Now he stutters and falls, now 
he is crawling into the earth. I assume 
he had something else in mind. 
So many have died, are dying 
there are not enough stories to name them 
and those who are left could care less about such tales.
Its ice-cap, milky green, confirmed the name. 
Three volcanic cones leaned northwest 
from our camp. Soon we'd begun to dig 
and not long after reached stone. 
Here were plants, the fine impression of leaf, 
and the bones of cats. A strange animal 
culture baked in basalt. 

Higher apes had inhabited the island 
before musk ox, polar bears, and ice. 
Compasses began to spin. 
Two of our party went temporarily blind. 
One lost his mind for good. 
And lost on a glacier, looking for its source, 
presumed dead, our eldest son. 

That magnetic land, like nothing 
on the map, surnmerlong southern light 
glaring across its flatter regions. 
We brought a dozen 
frozen mammal specimens 
and minerals back to the coast, 
boarded an ice-breaker 
and crossed to Halifax. 
Last night, in fear, my breathing 
lost its rhythm. My lungs loose sacks, 
I lay among my ruin -- the yesterday 
of what we call "events" -- and saw 
myself, my wife and sons, this house 
blown terribly apart: the seeds 
of joy dry powder on the sheets. 

But when I woke, the look of things 
that change had changed, some magic 
in me boiling up again. I saw 
my room as a boy, the shelves 
of books, rocks, model planes. 
The smell of glue -- a strange delight, 
a sweet exuberant music filling my head. 

Not trusting happiness, my sleep's 
a laboratory with the scent of ash. 
Oh, Ben, your cries latch onto my breast, 
your silence attaches my heart. 
Because small parts can vanish 
in the night, the family is a chest 
of drawers I tuck my demons into. 

Three months ago, through gasps of pain, 
I watched your mother push you home. 
Awash with light, you blinked into 
this final state. You'd fallen 
through the ice, a simple corpuscle, 
agog with the palpable day, and wet 
with the dark inner life of the world.
A light with the richness 
of cream pours over the bar. 
Slack night. I sip a glass 
of beer remembering who I think 
I am and then forgetting. 
"Killing's more direct than talk," 

he says, says he could do it still 
but what's the use? His breath's 
a heavy metal stink about like dirt 
or the wide circles 
of waiting he pledged allegiance to 
before his birth. 

Camped in the Asian dark, 
sick on his first patrol, 
he tells me how they wouldn't 
talk to him, his alien platoon 
that first night out. Then 
something like a finger beckoning. 

He turns, hears in his middle ear 
a bird's frail tune, 
thick eons shouldering over oceans of recall. 
With hardly time to think 
he's off his stool, rolling 
in a fit of peanut shells and drool. 

The mind at war 
has got its reasons. Plunging 
in a sink of need, 
he's there as well as here 
hands tensed around his snub-nosed, 
sharp-toothed pet, 

and suddenly I could do 
with one less beer. Tomorrow 
if he lives he'll 
burn a village, be a vet. 
All wars are fought by country 
boys used to this long road.
One gray animal walked to the edge of morning. 
The moon was behind it and the road 
wound north, an infinite hill. 
And as there was simply no 
reason to proceed 
with the project it had set out on 
days before, it sat down. 

                                     Eyes 
are all I see of its gray face 
staring into the morning 
chilled past all desire 
having at last come to the end.
He holds round her waist, and runs 
past cream-white columns, down 
marble steps, this man who means 
nothing to her except escape. Her bones 
bend softly, her tongue a speckled leaf. 
Bright lumina surround her body 
like a sheet. Blood oozes from a V-shaped 
wound in her abductor's foot. Too wise 
to fight and too discreet, she 
watches it clot. And then a gap 
in the dream and years go by a blank. 

                        *

White sun invades a lazy afternoon 
as the tale resumes: the younger wife 
of an important magistrate 
she's stunned by the soldier's return 
who carried her off -- the stupid 
physical lout. Of course she's grown, 
of course he won't approach her 
on his own, but there can be no doubt 
(that V-shaped scar on his foot) 
and she finds she must have the man 
though it may mean her life. 

                        *

A smell of disinfectant over leaves 
where one sad girl has settled 
turning her body to the impossible 
earth. Molecules of air like mice 
come nibbling at her pores. Jody, 
we've never met, but I hold your 
book, its marvelous poems borrowed 
from grief. They whisper inside seeds 
where shadows are and know the universe 
which struggles to be free 
ends with the breaking of a single law.
The angles of his face tend toward dispersion, 
his ways are diffident, cold, unendearing, 

and you wonder about his childhood: 
how early this graceless scion of the gentry 
knowing that only his brains would carry him 
began to perceive those 
gestures and responses by which other people 
meet and get acquainted, gestures 
which he must study in order to know. 

It puzzles you how he managed to court his wife 
and what attracted her, whether 
it was despair 
or the thought that she (more fluent in gesture 
and in relationships) would eventually 
gain mastership in their house; or was it love? 

Probably it was love, and that thought 
makes you look again, 
noticing the cleavages in his face 
unable to soften themselves in any way. 

Would she say, "He is not easy to know 
but once you know him ... "? 

Now they have moved to Australia, 
and have left behind a cat ("Tiger Lily," 
mother of eight, who has moved into your house 
and keeps to herself where the warm air gathers 
on the attic stairs). Because of her 
you have recalled 
the isolation he must live with at every moment 
which the rest of us submerge in mere "relationships" 
until that time 
when charm and spontaneity can do us no more good 
and we must cast off, along with our confusions, 
the concinnity of features that was our mask.
Scouting the derelict station 
under Webster Avenue, the boy, 
just nine, enters a blind alcove, once 
the ladies' room, toilets and sinks 
removed. Soft boned and squirrel 

toothed, he thrusts his thin legs 
down through cracked concrete, twists 
into that honied clutch of blackness, 
rips a knee, grips at his arms' 
full length and dangles, then 

drops to the dank below. The flap 
of something venomous whirrs off 
into a corner. His eyes approach 
a thousand dead-end eyes and cut 
away. A giant crab from someone else's 

dream and all the shiftlessness of 
broken glass. -- Can't catch his breath. 
Hour after hour he watches the evening wane 
while trains sluggishly rumble their tedious 
freight of skeptical learning to the city. 

Past midnight, half asleep he asks 
for water and sees the hand of his mother 
reaching out a cup, which slips, falls free 
between them, wets his jeans. He curls 
around the stain, an utter fugitive. 

Straining into the dark, his 
eyes discern a series of points 
in space, a curving grid on which 
the world is hung. It seems to him 
that everything else is false -- 

what they say in school, at home. He feels 
older, almost grown, hears in his inner 
ear a vivid blues-tune rising. A sultry 
vibraphone plays moody runs 
as if that song is what he is 

when everything else is gone. Come dawn, 
he glistens with the wetness of 
that place and knows he must 
pile stones to make a stair. There 
on the ground beside him a silver 

dollar catches his eye, but he 
doesn't believe in money, won't 
take it up though it might get him home. 
This beautiful mischance has left him 
a finished thing. He starts to pile stones.
Glass from our broken car, 
and troopers taking it down. My 
bruised wife taken in by eager 
men, white coats under their parkas. 

Jeffrey leans beside me in the 
cab, his tiny hand in my hand, 
and, dazed and shaken, I'm 
surrounded by creatures from another 

time: three years ago, a 
continent away her labor carried 
deeper into pain than I could 
follow, her bleeding sat me dizzy 

on a stool. An inch of 
skull crossed with the black 
hatchings of his hair 
stood me up again, and then 

a face. Slowly his shoulders 
edging through a crack which 
opened from a prior space. These 
his first acts: he 

pees in his mouth, cries, 
then lying on his mother's 
breast unsqueezes into life 
his dark-accustomed eyes. 

An ugly green liquid seethes 
along the pavement. Now 
husband and son together 
in the patient lobby, furled 

upon themselves, hands of a 
clock without the clock, waiting: 
I'm afraid it will glow like 
this at the end of the world.
The impulse to mourn wakes me up like a clock 
and before I've taken thought, I'm out of bed 
squinting into the sun and full of minor worries, 
lacking a coherent plan 
to get through the coming day without disaster, 
a day already begun on the wrong foot 
    under which a luminous chasm opens up, 
-- or is this the continuation of a dream 
still taking place and am I still asleep? 

Across a continent of evil, asphalt, twisted metal, 
a military train plunges into a tunnel, kaackety-kaack, 
each car separate and distinct, each 
linked to a master plan and moving west 
into a landscape of baited terror. Meanwhile 
the trembling underfoot may cause a rash excitement 
verging on affirmation. -- We've 
passed the introduction 
to a structure capable of shifting definition 
as it unrolls into a temporary present. 

His face red in the glare, Hemingway on a balcony 
watches the fiery splash of bombs. Madrid. 
"'sbeautiful as hell." 

The photos age and fade. 
Only a vague light on the spleen remains, 
affirms the possibility of damage, 
the dignity eternal pain confers. 
Our weapons lose their edge 
and in this book, The Picture History of a War, 
the dates are noted and the bodies tallied    
as if it all had ended, turning into what we are.
Evenings, a roach of light scrabbling through 
the walls of an hieratic solitude 
as the frantic child imagines in procession 
twelve cauled and swaying men, 
    ghost-like, their torches 
spiraling into the cavernous 
moss-ridden vaults of the mind. 

And by dawn the autumn landscape holds in perspective 
flats and vectors, irreconcilable distances 
from which the spark of flint is never absent. 
The boy gathers leaves, desiring 
a paradise of ashes, while from the brow of the sky 
a pulsing threatening eye looks down upon the earth 
as on a dangerous son. 

Toying with matches -- see the magnificent havoc, 
the wrestling bright bodies of the flame. 
Look, as an ember surges and darkens, at the terrible 
filial fear of the boy. 
    And when the cooling ash dies out of his reverie 
his skin's as dry as a snake's, his fingernails singed -- 
alone and afraid, his darkness shifts under the house. 

And this deceitful beautiful reticence of fire 
that wavers deeply into the drowsing night 
as a cool blue mist, like the prodigious feat of will 
that, in the outlying suburbs of the present, can recall 
those ancient burning fields, that lurid sky 
where the moon, a calm and loving face, 
first went up in flames -- 

faster and faster, the long abyss of fire 
while in his arbitrary fury 
-- because in the end we are all 
lost, all 
dancing into ash -- he beats against the finiteness 
and infancy of time: the child, my dark-eyed son, 
may he never be born.
Dozens of swans and geese 
launched on its tar-black surface. 
Sixteen tiny jellyfish 
slosh against the breakwater: these 
are all the vacations of 
my life I didn't know how to use. 

Behind me on the rise 
my wife and child 
move into sunlight, 
disappear. And in the South China 
Sea, all those thousands of 
bodies going to the bottom...!

I am a way of looking 
up out of a mask 
encrusted with seaweed. One swan 
chases another for fifteen, 
twenty yards. A goose flaps and 
flaps, filling her 

wings with joy, but does not rise.
And when I grew furious and lashed out 
   at my wife in front of my young 
   son, it was myself I savaged: 
these things stare at me from the mirror 
   like the pale-skin legend 
   of a fall many years ago 
from a cliff. For three days Christ 
   on the wall hovered over me as I 
   lay on the ward. Friends said 
my personality then changed: I want it 
   to change again! Oh spinning parts 
   of what I am, machinery 
accountable to pain, whatever time 
   has written on the flesh 
   these pigments made of neon are 
dispersing. I have reached the age 
   of anger, temper me. I smell 
   myself a dying animal ... 
Everyone wants the colors of change 
   to fade. Since childhood I've felt 
   that distance in me: a hilly lawn 
a boy of three spins down, bright 
   health and sunlight rarely 
   tasted since. Later, at the fenced- 
in corner of a neighbor-yard, fierce 
   bushes and the dirt I'd 
   fallen into dizzy and upset. 
And so by means of craft I'd hoped 
   to restore lost sanctions, forgotten 
   blandishments. What else can I 
look for in this life? There is a 
   mountain in my mind I am climbing 
   pathless, rocky, a wildness of sky 
leaping from the earth like a fountain 
   I walk into naked, at once 
   exalted and depressed: what a colorful 
absconding! all in an instant as I 
   fall asleep and wake, die 
   and am reborn, and I can barely 
remember the mountain with its teeth 
   of salt and I have climbed it, 
   what was earth, now air.
Sunlight, shouts, and the incalculable 
odor of dew. If we could just forget 
the Portuguese men who catch 

fish, the farmers in Jersey 
turning out cabbages, if the 
cobbles were softer than pillows, 

it would be beautiful to be a 
Jew, if we could eat rust, if the 
rivers disgorged their findings, and those 

women in silk were our sisters. 
Not the accidental spilling of a 
pushcart, or that sly gentleman 

in the alley pointing his dummy 
lens at kids while he focuses a 
hidden copper plate at this bench 

where we sit, reviewing into his prism 
the brittle figures that dance behind 
our eyes. Lies. lies. And this perfect 

disarrangement of our thoughts re the 
unrecorded incidents in Egypt 
give cogency to what has not been said 

about the sunlight flashing off those 
girders, whose angular soft 
shadows lodge on our faces like glyphs.
Ghosts of our parents when we were young, 
the love we owed them has been paid back: 
their beauty, brittle but luminous, 
like a Monet when the lights 
in the museum dim and the single guard 
sits on a corner stool and reads 
in the evening news of a girl 
missing from home these past ten days. 

Stolen? Fled? But he is thinking 
of his daughter, grown 
away from him now, living in another 
city where her husband, the ineffectual one, 
sells shoes in a shopping mall, and thinking 
of his grandson, five, too big and awkward yet 
to learn to ride a bike: so in her latest 
his childish daughter complains. 

His smile half regret, as he 
puts down the paper, strolls 
over to where in the dim 
light the reasoned canvas 
seems to mirror back the eye's own 
aging. Into what? Not immortality, but 
something better, harder, some set 
matrix of located color which, refocusing, 

invites us out to luncheon on the lawn.
Sun going down, and its orange 
out of the west smothered the purple water -- 
odors of spring and change until we couldn't bear it, 
until as we looked down it faded like an echo 
of all that we had ever thought to do. 

Aqualungs, fins forgotten, along with the urge to dive. 
No desire to forgive the porpoises, the past, 
their casual alien games, irredeemably offshore, 
laughably, touchingly cruel. 
So all precautions proved useless, even the stars: 

we might just as well have stayed home. Always 
we stumbled, we fell on our own sweet wounds, 
could never get straight the facts of growing up. 
Too young we saw too much and understood only 
there are so many ways to bleed. 

Warm nights on the reef, vast as the strange is lovely. 
Now Paris and calculus fade into 
green eyes one had forgotten, once no doubt essential, 
a stubbornness along the pulse we cannot quite dismiss, 
cool in this rippled backwash of the absolute. 

So when dawn surprised us again in the usual way 
the fishes nibbling our toes made us laugh; but now, 
while a plague of twelve-pointed starfish 
sucks at the lives of the reef 
and the venomous face of the stonefish drops into shadow, 

at last we begin to see: it is as if 
the whole past rose up within us calling our names 
and our loves are each a small and perfect coral animal 
feeding itself to the water. Together they form 
a thousand mile reef, endlessly alive on the pastel corpse 

of uncountable coral dead.
After sunset when the grieving 
move further into their grief 
and the stars are revealed by their master, the darkness, 
I have left the cities of the blind 
along tracks straight and cold as the north. 

Here I sit listening on the shore 
of a white and glacial distance. 
The voice of a girl like an opening flower 
begins to curl forth from the inner shell of the mind. 
So many nights I have waited. 

In cities the darkness gobbled me up and spat me out, 
my fears scuttled back and forth outside the door. 
Now the first birds waken and peck among fresh snow. 
The light begins to open 
with a pink and icy whisper along her cheek.
Over meals the summer we were ten 
you spoke about a defect in your bones: 
how you knew you were going to die, 
just not when. Sitting at those 
long tables, skidding a half-filled 
salt-shaker fitfully down the boards, I 
knew the difference between us: 
I could never die. 

In Maine again years later 
I row toward the yellow lilies 
among pale cress, remembering how 
at camp the summer after, you 
were an absence like the deer 
which soon may enter these waters 
shyly, not yet seeing the stranger 
silhouetted in his boat. I asked 
another kid from Philly where you were. 
You were dead. But how could that be 
when I could see you so clearly in my head? 

Few friendships last. For this 
the elders gather in dark-brown churches 
to make their peace. Now 
I can't remember your face at all. 
Still, on the tongue of each lily 
staring, dazed in the humid heat, a fly, 
and out of the deeper silence 
I sense that in a moment 
a buck will break from those trees 
and splash into the lake. 

Astonishing, his size, 
the surge of his ruddy hide 
as he flees the hush of my voice 
back into the woods, an antler and a leap.

Something you can hardly put
your finger to moved into town
last night. This morning,
upon waking, we see our mountain,
who has stood behind us, is gone --
along with the range of hills
that were our stolid neighbors.
The backyard contains only
the children's sandbox littered
with toy trucks, pail and shovel,
the doghouse with rusted chain.
Beyond that tall pine lies
what new land? Is surf rolling
beyond that cloud veil?
Or is a river falling?
We need our landmarks back,
our old faithful ones
to reassure us this is the way
we have come before.
Unsure now if we are
on the right path to the garden,
we slow, look twice. Place our
feet carefully. First one step,
then another, discovering our way.
The earth beneath our feet
telling us as we wade through mist
This world of cloudy shapes,
froth of waves, mountain mist,
is still the world
underneath it all.
The brook's small talk
         won't bring you here
for six days and five nights

it's never going to ask you
for any money down
                                 or talk you

into anything... it's only
talking to itself
                            or maybe the oaks,
the tulip poplars
     it goes on

and on    its small vowels
colliding with consonants    mossy

rocks, eddying around in
leaf lined pools... it's saying

something about _the mourning dove's_
_low notes in the early hours_...

and            _white tails stepping_
       _down from hills to nibble_
                  _those sheep-nosed apples_
_from their black branches_...

                                                      it keeps
its rambling to itself
out of respect    for your own

reasons for coming here    friend
pay it no mind
                                         it wants you

to know it has always
gone on         like this

ever since    it was
a little bitty brook.
Give thanks these brief days
the lee side of the holiday
for one sad-looking
picked-clean turkey carcass.
With tenderness, bathe it
almost like you would a child,
lovingly. Cover with water
in a large pot and simmer a few hours.
Turkey will be swimming in the air
as the windows cloud.
Spoon out wishbone and thigh bones,
and the fragrant rafts of skin,
skim off the queasy decks of fat
from the surface of broth
and what's left takes on new life
with peeled baby carrots,
a yellow onion, some chopped celery,
leftover spaghetti noodles,
and the fresh sprig of parsley
you rescued this morning
from under dried oak leaves
blanketing your garden.
Sup on this hearty
innkeeper's soup to cheer you
the long wintry night,
stoke your home fire's flame
and warm you to the depths
of your hearthstone.
Give some small thanks
for the big bird
whose clipped wings
could not outfly
its fate and praise it
for its rising
to feed you
again.
No longer on the state road,
walking gravel, then double wheel ruts,
I go back the way I came once, walking
cross-country. Alders and beech light my way.

         * * * * *

The earth forgives me my trespassing --
pine needles, dried leaves, moss beds soft beneath.
Bills, mortgage, wife, neighbors,
I have left behind. Birch tree
welcomes me back. Staghorn sumac, laurel,
an old hickory. Now the lowdown scent
of skunk cabbage. Hello, Jack-in-the-pulpit.
High in branches a squirrel's bark
announces my arrival. It is always good
to be back. On cool black mud,
an orange newt with its bright red spots.

           * * * * *

I begin reading the signs.
Many small hands have come this way -- raccoon,
opossum, skunk. I walk until dusk
and find a friendly maple. Back against it,
I eat. Evening arrives as I drink my tea.

            * * * * *

Huddled against the cold in my poncho,
I begin to drowse but scurrying among leaves wakes me.
Sudden movements up the trunk and a visitor is perched
on my shoulder. Then up the trunk and onto my head,
surveying the world from on high. To surprise him
I move my head -- he disappears in a flash --
and chuckle myself to sleep.

         * * * * *

In the morning
I wake to find my boot laces
chewed into pieces.                   
At the pass, where the reservists fall
like spiders with their lines,
dangling down the carved cliff
where the engineer corps drilled
dynamite holes to blast through
the mountain for the four lane --
almost beyond my vision
in the dreamy twilight,
something shaggy and wild,
with a coat to hide in the long grass
of autumn, slinked across my path,
slipping beneath the guard rail,
escaping to the valley below.
Four-legged, it was something
not quite a shadow
gliding lost and nameless
into the shadows.
No moocher of table scraps,
but one dark loper
to lurk the edges
and dark depths,
to worry our bones
as we sleep.

Spirit-that-will-not-be-caged,
Moon-stalker,
you make goosebumps
and the little hairs of my nape rise.
Tonight, we will lock our
family pet inside all night
though she cries and begs
to join small movements
among the laurel
under the wide moon's light.
We will keep what is ours close.
Beyond the reaches of our lamps,
the night is yours.
   Like others we know
   you too take what you do seriously
   and are always doing
   what you do best.
   There is much to be admired
   in your steady persistence.
   Always pushing onward,
   never too tired.
   Even dog day afternoons
when your pace slows,
   and your riffles smoothe out,
   even then you pace yourself,
   like the long-distance runner you are
   at heart. Never resting in your lonely bed,
   alone in this life-work that you do,
   flowing towards your end, yet always
   with us here in our valley.
   We puzzle over your ways,
   reflect on your shores and probe your
   deep runs and shallows with our lines
   and flashing beads to lure your wildest secrets
   from the depths of your cold heart.
   Eluding our grasp, you do what you do
   naturally, following your natural bents
   and this narrow bed you have made.
   Still we are drawn to your banks
   by your falls, your white-water,
   and your quiet brooding
   over deep pools. Looking at you,
   charmed by your changeable features,
   we lose ourselves in your magical fracturing
   of light. You allow us to see ourselves
   in you. When we return, refreshed, from swimming
   your cool waters, our cares wash downstream.
   We thank you for this and more, for nourishing
   crops and stock, for the speckled trout our children
   bring home. We could not imagine this valley
   without your mists rising off you
   in early morning. Without you running
   through our lives, elbowing around
   these hills, where would we be?
Emily, oh Emily.
	Let's write this letter
	to the one who confused you;
	let's say you never wrote
	poems behind the scenes at Burbank Studio,
	never wore a mini, no knee-high leather boots
	or fired off a snub-nosed .38 or spat out
	the words, "Get back, Jack. Hands
	against the wall and spread 'em."

	Let's tell him to listen hard instead
	for a wind like a bugle
	or watch for any small movements
	among the tall grass giving away
	that narrow fellow parting the green blades
	as he goes, the common backyard garden variety
	still known to haunt barefoot maids
	in summer dresses along garden paths
	when the yellow squash swell on their vines
	and green beans hang like elves' stockings
	growing larger sizes overnight
	as if by some natural decree
	or prank of some divine pixy
	with a grin.
The shoe salesman sizes you up
with a glance, knows paperwork 
has you stymied...by your heels.
He reads your sole and sees
how many trips you take
to the water cooler.                                                           

The barber knows by the length
of your sideburns how much
you will pay for a haircut
and whether you will tip him,
and if you will stand for his
wheezing in your ear, or if he must talk
weather and politics with you
instead of this favorites,
sports and girls.

The grocery clerk can tell
you are what you eat,
as she rings up chips and Coke,
apples and aspirin, Wonder Bread
and cornflakes.

And if anyone could tell,
the bank teller could
tell how your life lies
in the balance or your house on the brink
of an abyss to make the fault line
look like a soft shoulder.

The druggist knows what
will lift your spirits and what spirit
you favor. He knows 
what relieves your tension.
And the masseuse too knows which ways
to rub you, and if it can be helped,
will never rub you wrong.
Sole brothers, homely twins,
they cower in the corner
of the closet, as if knowing
what their chances are
of  being asked to go anywhere.
Worn, slightly frazzled, almost
too comfortable and willing 
always to go wherever with
only a moment's notice --
a match for two elderly spinsters.

One brother is holey, 
the other owns a loose tongue.
Gone are those days I could go
anywhere with them.  When
I would polish their leather
until I could see myself
in their shine.  Together,
we would all go out
on the town.

But now, no more talk
of the old days. Today, I'm taking
them out for a walk. Next weekend
we may hang some windows -- or even
paint the back porch.
Nobody there is that doesn't love a bean.
If not the royal Navy bean, then the wax bean,
the soybean, the green bean, the black bean -- the
pot is large, it contains multitudes -- white bean,
pink bean, small red bean, the lowly pinto, the
lovely lentil -- let the lamp affix its bean -- or
the walnut-shaped garbanzo, large lima bean, baby lima,
(A reunion of the Bean families is here assembled),
the cranberry bean, white kidney bean, northern bean,
or their cracked cousins: green split pea, yellow
split pea, and ol' blackeye. A lineup 
of likely legumes. Gather ye bean-pods 
while ye may. Go and catch a falling bean
and if you catch one, let me know.
A man and a woman are one. A man and a woman 
and a bean are one, or two, or three.

The beans I mean, no one has seen them made
or heard them made, but at supper-time
we find them there.  Come live with me,
and eat some beans and we will love
within our means. One could do worse
than be an eater of beans.

Shall I compare thee to a summer's bean?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Had we but world enough, and time,
this coyness, Lady, were no crime.
But, at my back, I always hear
a pot of beans bubbling near.

Mark but this bean, and mark in this,
how little that which thou deny'st me is.
An aged bean is but a paltry thing.
I must lie down where all ladders start,
in the foul rag-and-bean shop of the heart.
O my love is like a red, red bean,
that's newly picked in June:
O my love is like a pinto bean,
that's truly cooked at noon.

So much depends upon a red kidney
bean. You might ask, Do I dare
to eat a bean?  Dry beans can harm no one.
They remind us of home sweet home,
home on the range,
home where the heart is.
Without expecting anything in return,
they give us protein, zip, and gas.
Add what you will -- onion, tomatoes, red
pepper, chili powder, juice of lemon,
salt & pepper to taste. Add ham
hocks, bring to a boil, simmer slowly.
Call your friends, serve with
panache, crackers, and green salad.

How do I cook them? Let me count the ways --
boiling, steaming, frying, baking.
And if these verses may thee move,
Sweet Lady, come live with me
and be my love. And if this fare
you disapprove, come live with me
and please be my cook.
              Once the ancestors
              of these kernels
              were the darkest secret.
              A prize guarded
              and handed down the long corridor
              of years.  Sorting seed by seed,
              a young woman could learn patience, 
	  and to pick and choose carefully.

              If she picked carefully,
              she might win a husband
              for all her days.                                                                  
Today I have walked fields 
and trails looking for flowers.
They reminded me
of your enjoyment
when I'd bring you
the blossom of the day.
No matter what -- brown-eyed Susans,
a wild iris, daisies --
always you were pleased.

Today I noticed tiny violets
and spring flowers I don't know
the names of, so I'll call them
shyest girl in the class,
little one in blue,
blushing bride of the valley,
belle of the mountain,
lady of the dell.
And one I'll call snow flakes
in her hair. They
remind me of
when we first met.
They remind me of you
as you were when I last saw you.
They remind me of when you were a girl
and I didn't know you.
     If you're ever too lost to find your way,
     you may find yourself here, beside
     the remains of a two-stall carwash.
     A camouflaged island with spray-painted
     beaverboard latticework hides the
     prehistoric gas pumps. What looks like
     a converted gas station up on stilts
     is and isn't. The horseshoe over
     the doorway testifies to the ups and downs
     of life along this river road.
     It says you're home and welcome
     before you're even in the door.

     Stuffed trophy trout hang mouths open
     on a cinderblock wall. One antediluvian
     space heater hunkers in the corner.
     Homemade apple pie reflects under glass.
     The cook looks in from the kitchen,
     wearing a dirty T-shirt, earring,
     and three-day stubble.

     You can't see your smile in the worn Formica
     tabletop but across the river is the Ratliff Brothers'
     trailer park -- eight trailers up on blocks
     and canes growing thick to the riverbank.
     Out the window the river wrinkles, and winks
     at odd moments when you gaze from your booth.

     The coffee is strong enough
     to jump-start you, in thick ceramic mugs
     that don't match, survivors of Jersey turnpike
     diners' auctions and fires. Here they have
     a second life. On a wall of compressed wood chips
     and glue hangs local art so dismal you don't want to ask
     where the waterfall is, the grey too grey
     and the brown too brown to be anything but dismal,
     with too little green, and surely nothing
     you can see clearly enough to give a name to --
     meager as the parsley snip with your sandwich
     and overcooked French fries.

    Quarters lie under clear plastic,
    imbedded in the oak countertop
    by the register. The girl who
    takes your money couldn't land
    a bit part anywhere but here.
    Her grandmother owns this place. 
 A hawk is circling, overhead.
 Tiny red spiders crawling all over the basalt.
 I have one good foothold, one good
 handhold, and need one more...
 either toehold or crack will do
 to keep me moving up, keep me
 from falling....

 Halfway between the summit
 and the scree fanning out below
 into boulders the size of VW's at the base,
 hugging the rock
 like an awkward lover,
 my cheek pressed against stone,
 yearning for the ledge above
 a hardscrabble birch leans from,
 hanging onto what little ground it has,
 too tough to say die,
 its few green leaves like toy flags
 waving life, its stand
 against the worst weather
 northerly winds dish out.

 The black top winds from the trees
 to the state road. Panther Swamp off to my left
 over my shoulder. Sun at my back warms the rock.
 Dried snakeskin on the dead limb. Why did I choose
 Rattlesnake Mountain? What do you do if on that ledge
 you come eye-to-eye with a coiled surprise? Turn sideways
 maybe, protect your eyes, and with your good arm whip it
 into space like lightning striking. But keep a good balance.

 My heart tied to goldline,
 top-roped to my brother
 on belay somewhere above me in the clouds
 tied to a scrub oak, his anchor.
 Hope it's strong enough to hold --
 him and me.
 Why am I here?
 Why am I climbing this again?
 How many times must I climb it?
 One more time.
 This time.
 May be the last time.
 One way
 or another.

  How's it going? My brother calls
  from his end of the line.
  Up, or down?
  Which is it going to be?
  That's a good question, I say.
  Tell you in a minute
  or so.

  Usually the questions nag about now --
  stopping for a breath
  about half-way -- seeing below
  how far I have come, seeing above
  where I have yet to go.
        Then he said, "Come here. Look at me.
        You're too beautiful" -- his hand
        flashed by her face and she almost
        laughed, almost thought he aimed
        to slap her and missed -- but
        the razor slit her cheek
        like a tomato, blood splattering
        her new dress. "Someday you'll know
        why I did it," he said, "And you'll
        thank me." She screamed through
        her bloody hands, "You -- you monster!
        You --You're not my father! You're
        crazy! A father is supposed to love
        his children. You devil. I hate you.
        Look what you did to me! I hate you."

        That was then. Months ago.
        Mark of her defiance at his word,
        the neglected curfew, her laugh
        behind his back. A thin scar
        across her cheek marks their skirmish
        in his holy war against the flesh,
        which he knows too well --
        didn't he marry her mother?
        Tonight she negotiates with him
        for her release in his favorite
        yellow polka dot dress.
        Beyond the streetlight an engine
        idles. Her mother knows what she
        is fighting for -- her love, hate, life.                                                             
Two noisy young men have left
the obscure, dim bar lights inside
of what looks like from here
a sorry-excuse for a roadhouse
and have come outside
Into brilliant daylight,
bringing their disagreement with them
into the grimy parking lot
with its broken beer bottles
and oil-spotted pavement.

They curse and insult each other,
slapping, then shoving, and
grappling over car hoods and rolling
onto the filthy pavement. They break
apart and begin boxing. A few wild punches
and then, one or two, connect.

Who knows what they're fighting for?
Miss America, waiting inside,
with too much mascara, and perched
on a bar stool, cooing her displeasure
at "all the fuss" as she cozies up
to another Mai-Tai, perhaps?

One has short hair and the other long --
now the short-haired one grabs a fistful of long hair
and pulls, slamming his fist into the other's face,
now that he cannot escape....

It almost always comes down
to your vision of the beautiful
and your belief
that you are the right one.
From the heavens' roiling,
I was singled out on the hill.
Out of clouds, out of darkness,
out of thunder, come
         the light, the power.
         Singled out, I was
         struck blind
         by a fire-bolt.

         Later, they all flocked around me,
         wondering when I rose
         and spoke to them.
         Startled into speech, they
         asked of that no-man's land
         from which I had come, a traveler
         upon the road they would all
         one day travel.

         I could not tell
         what they would hear.
         They touched my wound
         and drew back. They feared
         and marveled. It was said

         I was a man among men
         but touched by the light,
         power, darkness, thunder.

         I could not see
         what they saw.
         They rallied around.
         They cried I had vision --
         I, who was blind.

         The heavenly bolt wounded,
         cauterized, branded me -- at once
         my curse, fame, glory.                                                           
Hide from heron under the cutbank
when he comes. Upstream the speckled brook,
my little brother, leaps, smashing the sky
into pieces. Mosquitoes swarm above.
Down here I lie beside my rock,
the siren song of the wild water
reaching me here where I live
down from the source calling to my need.
Soon I will be climbing the falls.
Hide from bruin's swipe, raking my run --
confusion like osprey's dive into these waters,
talons worse than the eagle's claw.
All's a flowing. Current is always passing.
I hold, and it brings me what I need,
angleworm, grasshopper, ant, damselfly, snail.
Gratefully I accept earth's offerings.
Nose to the current, behind this rock
I take what comes when it comes
or tail turn at the forked thing's twisted mayfly
lying unnaturally on a stonefly day.
Those times, rust flavors my musing,
I nurse an old wound. The barb deep in.
The current flows all around me, wherever I go.
A dull ache keeps me steady. White-water or brown,
it argues against my forgetting.
      There is nothing else in the world
      like it.
      It is a foreign country
      you somehow find yourself in
      where the only words you hear
      are those that rise within you
      like exotic fish rising from depths to kiss
      the surface of a pond into ripples.
      It is a nearby foreign land
      where your words echo 
      off the walls of your room.
      You are in this country alone.
      Another name for it is
      the life you have chosen.
      Solitude is the path
      that brings you here.
      Jays jabber in the trees,
      thunder reverberates in the valley.
      You learn the many voices
      of the rain. One day you begin
      speaking in one of the world's voices
      as if you had forgotten your native tongue.      

       One day a visitor finds you
       and speaks words you once knew.
       A voice rises within you -- the words
       that escape from you like caged birds
       suddenly freed fly around the room
       and her words--together all the words
       fly around and around
       in joyous circles, brushing lightly
       each other's wings. Together
       you sing a happy song. The two of you
       travel together into a new country
       where your words take you both
       by the hand, showing you the way.
       You learn the way together.
       Along this path there will always be
       an answer to your question,
       a question waiting for your answer.
       You will not be lonely.
       This is a new land you are discovering.
       There is nothing else in the world
       like it.
   You, who are reborn,
   find yourself young
   even as your children age.
   Once again you say you have found
   the gift you thought was lost.
   You give thanks and tell everyone
   the good news: each day we are born
   again. Child of the morning,
   may the spring rains fall gently
   upon you as you tend your garden,
   may song birds sing for you
   from the tops of your father's maple trees
   and the new sun strengthen you
   as you smile at your sons revolving
   around you, the center of their
   universe. May your husband learn
   every thing you wish him to know,
   and as you walk hand in hand with them
   may the sea breezes be kind and the water-
   birds favor you with their graceful
   ministrations on the air as their various
   calls and chattering mingle with your voices
   and laughter in a hymn of praise.
That was a clear day
when you sat in the parlor,
the day your granddaughter
and I came to call: there
was no baby crying in the other room,
no rain coming through
a hole in the roof, no smoke
from burning oak leaves
filling up the front room;
the sun was bright on the mountains
of slack outside Morris Run.                                                                

I didn't know then about those dark days
when air hangs heavy
with coal dust and the mind
loses its way. The women
gone, you conned me into rifling
drawers for the cigars
you planted earlier. We smoked
up until blue-grey clouds
hung from the ceiling.                                                                

You told me more than the story
of the big buck stepping from pines
each morning at sunrise
to nibble sweet flesh
off your apple trees, something
more than the claim
that the rainbows of the Susquehanna
light the eyes like white-water
falling far and fast:  sometimes                                                                

for those who share the light
and the air a while with us,
we must give our breath
to fan the flame, for it too quickly
becomes a smoldering ember
in a darkened cave.
       Northman, the potato flower
       is delicate as any, yet common
       and white. It grows anywhere
       far to the north, your country
       of pine treed mountains, deep, blue
       lakes where square tails divvy
       the currents between them.
       Remember the green smell of pine,
       the glue from pitch blacking
       your hands long after the climb
       down broken limbs, its sticking to
       a shirt someone ironed for you?
       And the speckled brookies leaping
       for mosquitoes, snaky streaks of
       nervy energy fighting always to the end
       the eagle claw hook buried deep
       in the gut? They are there,
       still, far back, away from the state
       roads, the party lines, the concrete
       walks of The Hardware City, where your
       friends danced the fox-trot
       to the tune of the Second World War.
       Conveyor belts of brass hinges gave way
       to shell casings. You became a leatherneck.
       The Marine dress blues uniform
       recruited you. The fighting colors
       of a bantam cock of the walk. From the
       halls of Oak Street to the shores of Iwo Jima.
       When the cockfight was over there,
       offshore breezes sickened downwind sailors,
       their green faces matching your fatigues.
       They arrived too late, bringing fresh K-rations,
       new pics of Grable and Lamour, the latest
       baseball scores, and other news
       from far off Eden. The swabbies looked
       around, shuddering. Tears like streams flowed
       full down their faces, they cried joyful stories
       of home in front of your eyes with wild gestures,
       anything to drive the look away, to bring back
       memories of the wall, and garden, pear tree
       growing in the backyard, your neighbor's doves
       cooing from their rooftop cages.
 The best fishing hole was legal
 if you weren't caught, my cousin
 said, on one of those nights
 the mayor fished with off-duty officers.
 I had trouble believing my cousin
 sometimes, then something would happen,
 and I'd believe him. Like the night
 he caught a barrel full. 

 After the long hike down the mountain,
 he said they were still alive.
 So we watched him dump them, foul water
 and all -- catfish, pike, bass --
 into a hogshead. Gulping fresh water,
 they couldn't believe such sweetness.
 Finning slowly, reviving in the April rainwater,
 like patients gradually recovering, suddenly
 entering the River Jordan. 

 Days later, the moss-backed barrel
 full to brimming, they spooked easily,
 alive to the crunched gravel
 of our approach. Five black, head-shaking bullheads,
 whiskers groping. A green pike long as your forearm
 rose and fell like a submarine, finning the clear water.
 A little big-mouth bass, holding his own among the big cats
 and the giant pike, going head-to-head with them
 for elbow room, jawing at them in self-defense
 like the only little man on a court of six-footers,
 making what moves he has to--an elbow, head-feint,
 dribbling between their disbelieving knees.                                                                
Wanderer, wherever you go,
whenever you drink again
from these melting snow fields,
the fog will slowly rise
off this lake of clouds,
you will walk softly
and not disturb
the wood-drake's dance,
the partridge's drumming,                                                                

for the white-tail's hoof prints
in cool black earth
beside the flat stone
upon which you kneel to drink
have impressed this upon you.

What if early death
or loss of friends
or love rejected or

gone unknown
into the hungry air
should down me

brushing my teeth
hunting for gray
in my hair

listening to the radio
on a dreary Sunday P.M.
fear is the floor

beneath the rug
Nat Cole singing
Once in a While
Sometimes a head and then a body.
Sometimes a body placed
beneath a head. And then:
who are these people?

Sometimes, on the street,
you see one. And another then.
And the sun in the sky like a swinging door.
And who are these people? Or,

they gather sometimes. Some
you see at tables
huddled around their drinks
as though the drinks were flames.

Others appear and vanish
in strobic vignettes. One
sits by you spilling
her marriage woes. (Who is she?)

You want to give her something.
Take this sandwich, please.
She won't go away. There is
no end to others.

They won't go away.
And the sun in the sky like a swinging door.

Who are these people
waiting in line like a list
of grievances? Where
does this line go? To the sun?

What do they want? Lips
move and hands gesture.
They are pointing to the sun.
They want it to go away.

Sometimes it is dark.
The streets are empty. You can hear
the doors close like sighs
of relief. Heads

and bodies
placed tenderly on beds.
They want each other to go away.
And millions of dreams filled with petitioning.
Never to repair the wounds of heaven,
but to lie in bed and dream of China
burdened by small breasted women
and friends who imply great sorrow in a touch
as thousands of miles away
love lies buried under the Wall of China,
memory vanishing like jars filled with tokens.

China's cities are wedded to the stars,
her maps held together by rivers.
The women of China have small breasts.
The first born are kept in jars.
When the women of China sob,
the rivers unlock a secret door
where Confucian perversions dominate.
The honey of heaven drips slowly from their breasts.

Where once I planned mass executions of my friends,
a telephone stands.
The line to China is busy.
Countless fingers grow from the phone
as grievances increase.
I consider the manifest destiny of a leaf.

With Rimbaud-like motions my friends explore China.
What I remember barely fills a jar.
The moon hunts out its pirates.
My friends plunder telephone booths
in claustrophobic fits of passion.
I place the white thread of sorrow
around the neck of a small breasted woman.

The Chinese laugh at the moon.
They fill their ships with leaves and dreams.
Endless sorrows plague their government.
Their gold outlives their beards.
Honey drips.

My small breasted friends are strangled by sorrow
My pain resides beneath the shadow of the moon
where the wounds of heaven pour forth
oriental madness to kill our dreams.
And my Chinese friends, numerous as telephones,
babble on like rivers . . . like rivers.
I bore myself a long way
in my hands,
saw myself struggling across the bleak terrain
of Bergman's Seventh Seal,
where Death leads his victims in a dance.

And though it was a dream
I wanted to come through,
convince myself of something. I don't know what.

In the faint light of the winter solstice
a cat stretched across my chest
pawing mindlessly.
I thought of Scott Fitzgerald's hell in Hollywood,
of his gestures shrinking into failure.

I lay back on the wrinkled sheets of the bed
watching the past contract
to a dot of blue light,
calmed by the fact of the house
and of what exists without a thought of me.
Doesn't it matter that I'm
crouched in the corner
reading by light
of an invisible moon?

I'm reading the oldest story
you could ever dream. . . .

Something about hands
spying on each other,
something about casting bread
and waiting by a river.

Doesn't it matter that hope
dogs me through the future,
false and the other kind
with one good wing?

I need a table shaped like an oar,
another life to sleep in.

I need someone to catch the difference
as it stumbles
not knowing where to fall next.
Working lives out by phone
is no less futile than by poetry.
It's all voice: in the head
or out, up the coast or down.
You'd think there was some way
to have coffee in a quiet shop,
find time to reminisce.
All the really good gestures are gone,
forgotten in this state of surfaces.
You say it's raining in San Francisco.
Last week the Santa Anas blew
blustering down the avenue
close to the ground.
You have to take everything as omen
when there's no interior to work through.
You have to say something, even
simply hello,
stretched like a hyphen between climates.
This is my place
and the time moves
as I choose. And I
select the songs
that make a simple
grace of quiet.
Common courtesy,
I know, dictates
otherwise, but sit
here on the floor
by me. The couch
is awkward and made
neither for love
nor comfort. Don't
be hesitant. Just
settle down.
So.
Beneath the floor
I hear my neighbors
fucking: the precise
syllables
of earned passion,
the 'oohs' and
'ahs'
of delight
drift up.
Here
is tenderness,
later playfulness
and the small attentions
of lovers. Again,
and still again
their insistencies
drift upward. Lovers,
unconcerned.

I turn on the radio,
hear the astronauts are ill
in the vastness of space,
sick
to their stomachs
and their craft failing.
Christ,
can we ever surmount
these difficulties.

And this morning
I heard a pigeon
going crazy in the eaves,
flapping
as though caught,
beating his wings
with terrible urgency
against the house.
What could I do,
anyway,
but listen
till he freed himself.
The day caught him
unaware.
He had risen only
to break

the great chain of sleep,
read poetry
if the elements permitted.

Bending over the flower,
a weed, he saw
a pivot for satisfaction

to turn on,
absorbing nuances of sunlight.

And knew he needed
a hand, an arm,
something breathing to lean upon
and make small talk.

He needed her to arrive home
that moment
and enter the garden,
to share delight
as it circled closer,

no longer a phantom,
nor imperceptible.
Slower and slower the days pass.

The rain gathers and departs
in a fine mist,
a clinging invisibility.

He stands at the garden's gate,
watches dimensions collected like old debts,
the endless traffic of the present.

All depth is taken.
He's left with his life's flat edge.

What can he say that bears repeating,
that he could say again
and not diminish?

No one calls.
No one comes to call.

The meat of a word
lodged deep in his throat.

The marrow and bone.
The song's motionless in the air.
The bird is.
Then descends to the bush.

The dog whines for nothing.
Nothing will come of it.
No one will feed her,
comfort her.
She paces, frantic,
the narrow channel between
their house his fence.

He checks the mail
knowing quite well
it hasn't arrived.

The noon ritual. Regardless.
Playing the stops of time.

He should send himself a card:

"habit's vainest creature
the man singing to himself."That is to say.

Sitting in the semi-dark
telling the phone to ring,
what small insistence he contains
wasted on the mute instrument.

Who is the man
who's known to be alone,
who craves the company
of only one woman?
The curse of his family men:

to be dumbly domestic,
to be unable to help themselves,

to sit in a chair after dinner
curled like a cat
wrapped in his own heat,

to bed alone
pretending to be asleep
on and on
in the dark room till dawn.
The burden of proof. Resting
in the easy chair.
Soliciting footsteps:

this one a male,
this a female.

Who will arrive
to break the spell of poetry?

Lives dazed into art by syntax.

A map of suffering
giving no relief.

That evening
he saw the satellite
pass through the sky
one frame at a time,
and felt the tenses shift.
The story that forgets to tell itself is no less a story than the one that begs to be told nor is that reluctance a virtue but, simply, a posturing for that attention each story craves. What a sorry sight: a man sits at his desk trying to write a story. He's been there two, perhaps three hours knowing there is no story to write, and that any story that does get written will be the activity's story, not his. The typewriter hums distractedly as a man does busy at some menial task. He needs an electric typewriter because he has confused the weary expression "plugged in" with the literal fact of being plugged in. He believes the network of wires of which his fingers are an extension actually is a conductor of words. It's all a silliness out of Cocteau's radio and should have been left in that place. The typewriter is humming "It's quarter to three, there's no one in the place except you and me." But now he is hearing the voice of the woman singing in the bedroom softly and seductively, almost to herself. Had she forgiven him their quarrel or was she mocking him, bored, peeved at placing second to that machine? Weary, unable to locate inspiration, he rose from the defeat from which he fashioned pleasure, defeated in his heart again.
In fact, the time did weigh heavy on his hands. It was a substance fashioned from available material. Some
thing that could hold or be held. Or, in the story, it was a woman sitting in the corner of the room reading
a book. Calling it a woman, it acquired shape and a pleasing countenance, a quaint tilt of the head, a manner of fussing with her hair. He was pleased that he could relegate this factor to the role of an image. He wanted to explain the process, to lay out the associational links of his imagination, but something prevented him. Now he wanted to ask her what she was reading, to make small talk, to justify his own presence in the room. But she was engrossed in the book. He knew she was edgy, if disturbed she would leave the room abruptly with practiced gestures, familiar moves, the index finger of her right hand marking her place in the book. It was possible the book was a prop, that, in the story she was watching him standing at the window. He would turn to her and smile, give acknowledgement of her presence, but she would say something cutting about how he wasted his days and they would quarrel. He watched the weather shift. A slowly unfolding pattern of clouds moved in from the mountains, floating high and thin-edged like the pages of a book, The light turned gray and dull along the edge of the sky.
The plane, moving against time, against the motion of the sun, was an instrument for healing, cutting from his system the melancholic idea of that other place. He wanted to be free of the sense that all possibility was attended by regret so that the future was bathed in nostalgia. In all the simplicity of the term he wanted to
be here. The woman sat in front of him. She was lovely the way certain fashion models are lovely, a face made to extract a reaction of distant admiration. Her cheekbones, two dramatic sweeps, were faint allusions to the primitive. There was a blond, perfect child on her 1ap; another peered out the window; a third, considerably older, he took to be a brother. He wanted to meet her. More exactly, he wanted to know her, to come to her with a shared past and the assurance of a predictable future. He wanted to ask her how she was and what she was up to, and not have to explain himself, to endlessly explain himself. But all through the flight the child squawled and cried. Later, in the city, he strolled through a museum trying to fix his image in each image presented him, pained to think he had to see himself in terms of something else until all that he was was outside himself, distant and metaphorical. He listened disinterestedly to the story until he could distinguish her voice. They walked together slowly through a Miro exhibition. He made a trivial comment on Miro's imposition of form upon surfaces that seemed to stretch to infinity. She nodded, and he was pleased she saw the work through his eyes. Coffee later, and then he accompanied her as she shopped for children's clothes. They parted uneasily in the evening rush retreating to the edge of a story neither would tell the other within the frame of a story telling them to itself.
Bewilderment
adorns your faces
like a keepsake
you mouth
the one word
the future allows
pardon
like a guest
entering the small dark
of a closet
apologizing
to the clothes
Smoke is rising from the boiled potatoes
in the rose-bottomed bowl
on my grandfather's table. My father

is waiting for the rose to appear
pried from the weight of the family's hunger.
Above the table, like a spirit
unsure of which body to enter, the smoke lingers. Eat!

my grandfather urges. Eat. Eat
and grow stronger. Eat
so the rose will appear.
In a novelist's Warsaw,
in a long shabby coat,
a red bearded Jew stands on a street corner
nodding his head.

The future whispers in his ear
in Yiddish. He shrugs.
Nothing surprises him.

He will walk down that street
entering any room they tell him to enter.

He will board that train
pretending to pretend it's a mere relocation.

In the prayerhouse the Messiah plays cards,
killing time.
He makes bad jokes like a traveling salesman.
He farts and forgets to apologize.
My parents were fish.
They came from Europe, swimming.

This was before Hitler was invented,
when a wheel barrow of money
got you a loaf of bread.

Twice, they voted for Stevenson,
and he dropped dead on the streets of London.

Mamie was drunk. McCarthy mad.

They did their jobs.
They didn't weep over the Rosenbergs.

They tried to buy their way
out of history.
The rising elevator was their armor.
The wolf at the door was the family crest.

Two weeks before he died, my father smiled wisely
over murdered Kennedy, and lifted his shovel
and bent his back,
and went to dig in the streets of gold.
The year I am born
the Paradise plays
"The Best Years of Our Lives."
Turning the corner
onto the Grand Concourse
you stop, claw for your heart
with your wrinkled scholar's hands,
sprout wings and rise
above the Bronx. Uncle,
you were the first to reach
the suburbs: a small plot
out on the Island.
Today, you do not lack
company. All the wives,
the wise guy brothers
with their flies at half mast
have joined you.
Their only assimilation.
You were The Oldest.
The Saint. The Brain.
A half dozen languages
so why isn't he married?

Say it is early Spring.
You arrive at your sister's
bearing lox, bagels and rolls
warm from the oven.
My father sits by the window,
remote, a wage earner.
You two don't talk.
As he looks on, and my sister,
awed, looks on,
you touch my mother's belly
hat still pushed back on your head
and say the one word
for hello, for good-bye.
The fool sat on the steps
singing his song
in a wordless whine.
I climbed beyond him
through hallways long and dark
as subway tunnels
running under the water,
feeling my way, opening doors
into strangeness
strange for all that was repeated:
the shapes of those rooms,
the furniture
turned from the sun
to save their dull colors,
the old world odors.
I heard the words
shatter against the wall
like empty glasses, the steps
of the troubled husband
tapping out a code, rain
in the courtyard
soothing the soot covered leaves.
Far below,
I saw the light trickling
into the deep well of the stairs,
and knew it would rise, floor to floor
seeking its level, seeking
me finding my room,
tender and remote as a parent
to bear me half waking,
half sleeping.
I lived there.
When I fell in at five,
they fished me out.
The stranger holding me
laughed, his trousers rolled up
like shirt sleeves. My mother,
drowning on the shore,
could find no life to pass by
worth living twice. Years later,
I made him her lover.
From the distance, as I played,
I watched them together
sitting quietly on a bench near the pond.
They came from the same town.
My mother marveled
that people might live so close
yet never meet. They laughed,
rose from the bench
and strolled by. The ducks
sparkled gaily in the sun.
My mother knelt to feed them bread,
stirring her hand over the water.
My father's silhouette sneaks a smoke
in the john. The fire he swallowed forty years ago
exits in small shapeless puffs he studies indifferently.

On the rooftop, friends watch for missles
that will brush by them gentle as the breath
of a shopper in a department store.

The grocer walks by with his finger to his lips
like a town crier in a ghost town. He has a method
for surviving holocausts.

His heart is a heap of ashes
occasionally flaring.
One spring day
in the woods in Germany,
I found a piece of string
tied carelessly around a tree.

A couple strolled by and embraced.
I watched from a rock
as they stepped into the deep woods
together.

I remembered a photo of myself
in a row of children,
the names holding down the tiny faces
like paperweights,

and one of my mother
dressed as a gypsy,
eager and young
before the birth of her daughter.
At that height
they might be four black stars
or the small dark eyes of my ancestors
bereft of kindness.

In their beaks they bear
the scroll of my life: the story
I don't know how to tell.

Their endless orbiting might be an alphabet
spelling the same words again and again:
like,
and as though.
Their faces are breaking free
again. The door blows open.
They can walk into any dream they choose.

They choose yours. They put their faces
on your face. You yank them off.
They appropriate breath. They float above you

like smoke. They resemble you.
You resemble them.
They are crying. Alive,

they never cried. You see them
shrunken in their immense coffins
like babies in bathtubs.

There are too many.
Too many griefs to choose from.
And you don't know which you prefer.
Beneath their beards
they are fading
like Victorian photographs.

They stare straight ahead
beyond you, beyond the wall,
beyond fatherhood
to a camera lens
embedded in a skull, embedded
in a Jew in western Russia.

Their families surround them
like jewels on a crown,
like dung around a dray horse

Fearing erections,
children may not sit
on their laps.
Fathers without sons: smoke
without fire. They can't enter heaven.
Hell won't have them.

Hands in pockets.
A new t.v. not yet paid for.

They read the paper
weeping at the sports section.
Who will go out for a pass
in the dark night of the soul?

They roam' the house,
opening and closing doors.

In the bedroom,
a mirror grows a face from loneliness.
The face grows a beard.

Mothers in corners like spider webs.
A father with roots for feet stands in the yard,
stamps down hard, and stretches out his arms.

Soon there is a lovely shade tree for the family.

Mother sits beneath it, sipping lemonade, knitting,
her legs tanning gently beneath a billowy summer dress.

The children build a swing in it.

The youngest climbs all the way to the top
where he stands with his arms stretched straight up,
his feet in father's eyes.

"There," his mother says, "you're that much closer
to heaven."
They are terrified of them.

They hear them pacing
inside
like prisoners in a cell.

In a train
returning from work,
they hear them whispering to other hearts.

They will not sleep with their wives
tonight.
This trembling hand a wing.

This dreaming head an engine.

This newspaper over the face
a distant shimmering landscape,

a snowy alpine region
where figures the size of cells
wave frantically for rescue.
They hear the coffin woo the nail
with promises.
Sounds like the breath of a fevered child.

To slam a door
is to open a wound.

To open a door
is to court disaster.

Snoring is a lifeline,
a trail of crumbs through the spooky woods
back from the terrible cottage.

Waking up a vindication.
How peacefully he sleeps in that harvest.

An awesome-bossomed goddess
graces the field. Loaves
appear magically at her feet
and toddle off like children.

All is gold and happens slowly.

Capitalism rises
discretely
as a gentleman's erection.

Stones for a house gather at the field's edge.

Father sighs in his sleep.
He wakes on the bus
weaving through pits and dumps
to the edge of the city.

His lunch pail guides him like a seeing eye dog

Skinny cranes flay the air,
necks as beautiful as swans'.

The factory whistle sighs
like a disappointed goddess.

The Industrial Revolution sits in a chair
chain smoking.
On the ship the wind
caught up mother's kerchief
and father trembled.

In the harbor, shit-stained gulls
caroused overhead
creating an alphabet.
Father learned English then,
the language of birds and the future.

"Oh you kid," he said, and
"I can't give you anything
but love,
baby."

Mother's skirt rose straight up
and fluttered like Peary's flag
over the North Pole.

Or was it the South?
Families come from everywhere,
convinced he is theirs.

A mother's yowl
pours out like smoke.

A son climbs it --
Jack in the Beanstalk --
and meets his infancy coming down.

Beneath the earth,
skin deserts skull
for a, new face.
Perhaps they are here.
Something is.

Something trails you
sneaking from doorway to doorway
like a cheap detective.

Something you can't shake:
a feeling with skin.

You turn around.
You turn and turn and turn
dancing on the street corner

like a compass needle
gone crazy.
A gnarled tree twisted in the heart
makes of the tongue a dry leaf.

Winter night.
A pair of shivering blackbirds
perches in the throat.

The moon drifts behind the eyes,
drowns the family in darkness.
Some fathers
have no sons.

Blood seeking wounds.
A son can't sleep.

There is a light in the corner of the room.
A liquid light
dripping from the ceiling.

"What do you want?" the son asks.

The light drips.
It just drips.

He places a bowl beneath the light.
He stays awake all night watching the light
drip into the bowl. It just drips.

In the morning he finds the bowl filled
with clear warm water,
and shaves with it.
Fathers dancing in the moonlight.
Sad fathers. Horny fathers.

Bone weary, grief dancing fathers
while their families sleep.

Fathers whose wives
turn at night to the wall,
who have sired flea-brained sons,

whose hearts turn on them
like ungrateful children.
Fields of fathers swaying like flowers.
