 
 Good god or My 
I cry and die and lie 
beside 
 
She is the apple in my eye 
She talked to god 
I couldn't cope 
Or'd hope eloped 
A dope she roped 
This salty lie 
 
CHORUS 
And when she's dreaming, I believe 
And when she's reading, I retreat 
Can't believe her 
Telling me she's dead again 
Telling me she's dead against it 
 
And deep my wound 
Within for every second chance 
it was deign torn 
 
From deep within, despite the rain, my words are worn 
 
She loves to talk into the phone 
No matter who 
No matter when 
No matter where 
No better than the faulty line 
 
CHORUS 


 


DEAD MAN WALKING

  
 
He swivels his head 
Tears his eyes from the screen 
As his past puts him back 
in Atlantic City 
There's not even a demon 
in Heaven or Hell 
Is it all just human disguise 
As I walk down the aisle 
 
And I'm gone gone gone 
Now I'm older than movies 
Let me dance away 
Now I'm wiser than dreams 
Let me fly fly fly 
While I'm touching tomorrow 
And I know who's there 
When silhouettes fall 
 
And I'm gone 
Like I'm dancing on angels 
And I'm gone 
through a crack in the past 
Like a dead man walking 
Like a dead man walking 
 
Two young men dancing under the lamplight 
Shaking their sex and their bones 
And the boys that we were 
An alien nation in therapy 
Sliding naked and new 
Like a bad tempered child 
On a rain slicked street 
 
And I'm gone gone gone 
And I'm older than movies 
Oh let me dance dance dance 
Now I'm wiser than dreams 
Let me fly fly fly 
While I'm touching tomorrow 
And I know who's there 
When silhouettes fall 
And I'm gone 
 
And I'm gone, like I'm dancing on angels 
And I'm gone, 
through the crack in the past 
Like a dead man walking 
Like a dead man walking 
Like a dead man 
Like a dead man walking 
 
And I'm gone gone gone 
Let me dance dance dance 
And I'm gone gone gone 
Let me dance dance dance 
And I'm gone, like I'm dancing on angels 
And I'm gone, 
through a crack in the past 
Like a dead man walking 
Like a dead man walking 


 


DIAMOND DOGS

 
 
As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent 
You asked for the latest party 
 
With your silicone hump and your ten inch stump 
Dressed like a priest you was 
Todd Browning s freak you was 
 
Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee 
I m sure you re not protected, for it s plain to see 
The Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees 
Hunt you to the ground they will, 
mannequins with kill appeal 
 
CHORUS 
(Will they come?) I ll keep a friend serene 
(Will they come?) Oh baby, come unto me 
(Will they come?) 
Well, she s come, been and gone. 
 
Come out of the garden, baby 
You ll catch your death in the fog 
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs 
 
 
The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat 
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase 
 
The elevator s broke, so he slides down a rope 
Onto the street below, oh Tarzie, go man go 
 
Meet his little hussy with his ghost town approach 
Her face is sans feature, but she wears a Dali brooch 
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake 
 
Wrecked up and paralyzed, Diamond Dogs are sableized 
 
CHORUS 
 
 
In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch 
Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the Ditch 
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch 
(There s gonna be sorrow) try and wake up tomorrow 
 
CHORUS 
 
 
Ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs (x2) 
Bow wow, woof woof, bow wow, wow 
Call them the Diamond Dogs (ad lib) 
 
Keep cool Diamond Dogs rule, OK 
Beware of the Diamond Dogs (repeat) 


 


DJ

 I'm home, lost my job, and incurably ill 
You think this is easy, realism 
I've got a girl out there, I suppose 
I think she's dancing 
Feel like Dan Dare lies down 
I think she's dancing, what do I know? 
 
I am a D.J., I am what I play 
Can't turn around no, can't turn around, no, oh, ooh 
I am a D.J., I am what I play 
Can't turn around no, can't turn around, no, oh no 
 
I am a D.J., I am what I play 
I got believers (kiss kiss) 
Believing me, oh 
 
One more, weekend, of lights and evening faces 
Fast food, living nostalgia 
Humble pie or bitter fruit 
 
I am a D.J., I am what I play 
Can't turn around no, can't turn around no, ooh 
 
I am a D.J., I am what I say 
Can't turn around no, can't turn around, ooh 
I am a D.J., I am what I play 
I've got believers (kiss kiss) 
Believing me 
 
I am a D.J., I am what I play 
Can turn around no, can't turn around 
I am a D.J., I am what I play 
Can turn around no, can't turn around 
I am a D.J., I am what I play 
Can turn around no (kiss kiss) 
 
Time flies when you're having fun 
Break his heart, break her heart 
He used to be my boss and now he is a puppet dancer 
I am a D.J., and I've got believers 
 
I've got believers 
I've got believers 
I've got believers in me 
I've got believers 
I am a D.J., I am what I play 
I am a D.J.

 


DODO

 Now we can talk in confidence 
Did you guess 
that we've been done wrong? 
Lies jump in queue 
to be first in line 
Such a shameless design 
Ah, thinks he's well screened 
from the man at the top 
It's a shame 
that his children disagree 
They coolly decide 
to sell him down the line 
Daddy's brainwashing time 
 
He's a dodo, no no, 
didn't hear it from me 
He's a dodo, no no, 
didn't hear it from me 
 
She's quite enthralled 
with her childhood of yore 
When a unit was a figure, not a she 
When lovers chose each other, 
now the perks are due 
Another memo to screw 
 
She's a dodo, no no, 
didn't hear it from me 
She's a dodo, no no, 
didn't hear it from me 
Can you wipe your nose my child 
Without them 
slotting in your file a photograph? 
Can you sleep alone at night? 
Wake to find the scorching light of neighbour Jim 
He's come to turn you in 
 
Another dodo, no no, 
didn't hear it from me 
Another dodo, no no, 
didn't hear it from me 
Ah, another do do, no, 
didn't hear itdo do, do do

 


DON T LET ME DOWN AND DOWN

 (Tahra / Valmont) 
 
Still I keep my love for you 
No place to hide no way to fall 
Nowhere to lie no world so wide 
I'm sick and tired of telling you 
Don't let me down and down and down 
Don't let me down and down and down 
 
I know there's something in the wind 
That crazy balance of my mind 
What kind of fool are you and I? 
Scared to death and tell me why 
I'm sick and tired of telling you 
Don't let me down and down and down 
Don't let me down and down and down 
 
 
Still I keep my love for you 
 
You made a date with destiny 
You jog jog in my memory 
You haunt in mind not fade away 
I'm sick and tired of telling you 
Don't let me down and down and down 
Don't let me down and down and down 
I'm sick and tired of telling you 
 
Still I keep my love for you 
No place to hide, no way to fall 
Nowhere to lie no world so wide 
I'm sick and tired of telling you 
Don't let me down and down and down 
Don't let me down and down and down 


 


DON'T BRING ME DOWN

 (Johnnie Dee) 
 
I'm on my own, nowhere to roam 
I tell you baby, don't want no home 
I wander round, feet off the ground 
I even go from town to town 
I said I think 
this rock is grand 
Say I'll be your man 
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down 
 
I met this chick, the other day 
And then to me, she said she'll stay 
I get this pad, just like a cave 
And then we'll have, our living made 
And then I'll lead her on the ground 
My head is spinning round 
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down 
 
I, I, I, I, I need a lover 
'cause someone new 
 
And then to her I will be true 
I'll buy her furs and pretty things 
I'll even buy a wedding ring 
But until then I'll ?settle down? 
Say I'll be your man 
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down 
Until then I'll ?settle down? 
Say I'll be your man 
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down 
Don't bring me down 


 


DON'T LOOK DOWN

 (Pop/Williamson) 
 
Don't look down 
They're making sorta crazy sounds 
Don't look down, no 
Don't know who else came to kneel 
On this empty battlefield 
But when I hear that crazy sound, I don't look down 
From Central Park to shanty town 
I always hear that crazy sound 
From New York to shanty town 
There's always something else 
Don't look down, no 
 
I went this morning to the cemetery 
To see old Rudy 
Valentino buried 
Lipstick traces on his name 
He never looked down 
'Cause they were making crazy sounds 
From Central Park to shanty town 
He always heard that crazy sound 
There's always something else 
Don't look down, no 
 
When I see you standing there 
I can't see the clothes you wear 
I just hear that crazy sound 
And I can't look down 
From Central Park to shanty town 
I've always heard that crazy sound 
From New York to shanty town 
There's always something else 
Don't look down, no 
Don't look down 
Don't look, don't look down 
 
No I won't be bored I won't be there 
Look at life it's no piece of cake 
When I hear that crazy sound 
I don't look down 
From Central Park to shanty town 
I always hear that crazy sound 
From New York to shanty town 
There's always something else 
Don't look down 
Don't look down, no 
Well, don't look, 
don't look down 


 


DRIVE IN SATURDAY

 
 
Let me put my arms 
around your head 
Gee, it's hot, let's go to bed 
Don't forget to turn on the light 
Don't laugh babe, it'll be alright 
Pour me out another phone 
I'll ring and see 
if your friends are home 
Perhaps the strange ones in the dome 
Can lend us a book we can read up alone 
 
And try to get it on like once before 
When people stared in Jagger's eyes 
and scored 
Like the video films we saw 
 
CHORUS 
His name was always Buddy 
And he'd shrug and ask to stay 
She'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid 
And turn her face away 
She's uncertain if she likes him 
But she knows she really loves him 
It's a crash course for the ravers 
It's a Drive in Saturday 
 
Jung the foreman prayed at work 
That neither hands nor limbs would burst 
It's hard enough to keep formation 
amid this fall out saturation 
 
 
Cursing at the Astronette 8 
Who stands in steel 
by his cabinet 
He's crashing out with Sylvian 
The Bureau Supply 
for ageing men 
 
With snorting head he gazes to the shore 
Which once had raised a sea 
that raged no more 
Like the video films we saw 
 
CHORUS 
It's a Drive in Saturday (repeat)

 


EIGHT LINE POEM

 
 
The tactful cactus by your window 
Surveys the prairie of your room 
The mobile spins to its collision 
Clara puts her head between her paws 
They've opened shops down West side 
Will all the cacti find a home 
But the key to the city 
Is in the sun that pins 
the branches to the sky 


 


EVERYONE SAYS HI

 () 
 
Said you took a big trip 
They said you moved away 
Happened oh, so quietly 
They say 
 
Shoulda took a picture 
Something I could keep 
Buy a little frame 
Something cheap 
For you 
 
Everyone says hi 
 
Said you sailed a big ship 
Said you sailed away 
Didn't know the right thing 
To say 
 
I'd love to get a letter 
Like to know what's what 
Hope the weather's good 
And it's not too hot 
For you 
 
Everyone says hi 
Everyone says hi 
 
Everyone says 
Don't stay in a sad place 
Where they don't care how you are 
Everyone says hi 
 
If the money is lousy 
You can always come home 
We can do the old things 
We can do all the bad things 
If the food gets you leery 
You can always phone 
We could do all the good things 
We could do it, we could do it, 
we could do it 
Don't stay in a bad place 
Where they don't care how you are 
 
Everyone says hi 
Everyone says hi 
Everyone says hi 
And the girl next door 
And the guy upstairs 
Everyone says hi 
And your mum and dad 
Everyone says hi 
And your big fat dog 
Everyone says hi 
Everyone says hi 
Hi hi hi hi

FALL DOG BOMBS THE MOON

 Hope little girl 
Come blow me away 
I don't care much 
I win anyway 
Just a dog 
 
I'm God damn rich 
An exploding man 
When I talk in the night 
There's oil on my hands 
What a dog 
 
Fall dog is cruel and smart 
Smart time breaks the heart 
Fall dog bombs the moon 
 
Devil in a market place 
Devil in your bleeding face 
Fall dog bombs the moon 
What a dog 
 
There's always a moron 
Someone to hate 
A corporate tie 
A wig and a date 
Just a dog 
 
These blackest of years 
That have no sound 
No shape, no depth 
No underground 
What a dog 
 
Fall dog is cruel and smart 
Smart time breaks the heart 
Fall dog bombs the moon 
 
A devil in a market place 
A devil in your bleeding face 
Fall dog bombs the moon 
What a dog

 


FAME

 /Alomar) 
 
Fame, makes a man take things over 
Fame, lets him loose, hard to swallow 
Fame, puts you there where things are hollow 
Fame 
Fame, it s not your brain, it s just the flame 
That burns your change to keep you insane 
Fame 
Fame, what you like is in the limo 
Fame, what you get is no tomorrow 
Fame, what you need you have to borrow 
Fame 
Fame, Nein! It s mine! is just his line 
To bind your time, it drives you to, crime 
Fame 
Could it be the best, could it be? 
Really be, really, babe? 
Could it be, my babe, could it, babe? 
Really, really? 
Is it any wonder I reject you first? 
Fame, fame, fame, fame 
Is it any wonder you are too cool to fool 
 
Fame 
Fame, bully for you, chilly for me 
Got to get a rain check on pain 
Fame 
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, 
fame 
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, 
fame 
Fame, fame, fame 
Fame 
What s your name? 
 
 
(whispered): 
 
Feeling so gay, feeling gay? 
Brings so much pain?

 


FANTASTIC VOYAGE

 (Lyrics by Bowie 
Music by Bowie/Eno) 
 
In the event 
that this fantastic voyage 
Should turn to erosion 
and we never get old 
Remember it's true, dignity is valuable 
But our lives are valuable too 
 
We're learning to live with somebody's depression 
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression 
We'll get by, I suppose 
It's a very modern world, 
but nobody's perfect 
 
It's a moving world, 
but that's no reason 
To shoot some of those missiles 
Think of us as fatherless scum 
It won't be forgotten 
'Cause we'll never say anything nice again, will we? 
 
And the wrong words make you listen 
In this criminal world 
Remember it's true, loyalty is valuable 
But our lives are valuable too 
 
We're learning to live with somebody's depression 
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression 
We'll get by I suppose 
But any sudden movement I've got to write it down 
They wipe out an entire race and I've got to write it down 
But I'm still getting educated but I've got to write it down 
And it won't be forgotten 
'Cause I'll never say anything nice again, how can I?

 (words by Bowie and Luther Vandross / music by Luther Vandross)

Fascination moves sweeping near me

FASHION

 
 
There's a brand new dance 
but I don't know its name 
That people from bad homes 
do again and again 
It's big and it's bland 
full of tension and fear 
They do it over there but we don't do it here 
 
CHORUS 
Fashion! Turn to the left 
Fashion! Turn to the right 
Oooh, fashion! 
We are the goon squad 
and we're coming to town 
Beep beep

Listen to me don't listen to me 
Talk to me don't talk to me 
Dance with me don't dance with me, no 
Beep beep 
 
There's a brand new talk, 
but it's not very clear 
That people from good homes 
are talking this year 
It's loud and tasteless 
and I've heard it before 
You shout it while you're dancing 
on the whole dance floor 
Oh bop, fashion 
 
CHORUS 
 
Listen to me don't listen to me 
Talk to me don't talk to me 
Dance with me don't dance with me, no

Oh, bop, do do do do do do do do

FIVE YEARS

 
 
Pushing thru the market 
square 
so many mothers sighing 
News had just come over, 
we had five years left to cry in 
 
News guy wept and told us 
earth was really dying 
Cried so much his face was wet 
then I knew he was not lying 
 
 
I heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies 
I saw boys, toys electric irons and T.V.'s 
My brain hurt like a warehouse 
it had no room to spare 
I had to cram so many things 
to store everything in there 
And all the fat skinny people, and all the tall short people 
And all the nobody people, and all the somebody people 
I never thought I'd need so many people 
 
A girl my age went off her head 
hit some tiny children 
If the black hadn't a pulled her off, I think she would have killed them 
 
 
A soldier with a broken arm, fixed his stare to the wheel of a Cadillac 
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest 
and a queer threw up at the sight of that 
I think I saw you in an ice cream parlour 
drinking milk shakes cold and long 
Smiling and waving and looking so fine 
don't think you knew you were in this song 
 
 
And it was cold and it rained so I felt like an actor 
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there 
Your face, your race, the way that you talk 
I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk 
 
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes 
We've got five years, what a surprise 
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot 
We've got five years, that's all we've got 


 


FRIDAY ON MY MIND

 (Young/Vanda) 
 
Monday morning feels so bad 
Everybody seems to nag me 
Coming Tuesday I feel better 
Even my old man looks good 
Wednesday just don't go 
Thursday goes too slow 
I've got Friday on my mind 
 
CHORUS 
(See my baby) 
Gonna have fun in the city 
(feel like fucking you) 
(Do my baby screw) 
Be with my girl 
she's so pretty 
(all I want to do) 
(I'll go crazy) 
She looks fine tonight 
(zoom zoom zoom) 
She is out of sight to me (so divine) 
(Tonight) I spend my bread 
(Tonight) I lose my head 
(Tonight) I've got to get tonight 
Monday I have Friday on my mind 
 
Do the five day drag once more (Monday blue) 
 
There is nothing else that bugs me 
More than working for the rich men (poor man, beggar 
man, thief) 
Hey I'll change that scene one day 
Today I might be mad 
Tomorrow I'll be glad 
'Cause I'll have Friday on my mind 
 
CHORUS 
 
(See my baby) (feel like fucking you) 
Gonna have fun 
(zoom zoom zoom) 
Be with my girl (repeat ad lib.) 


 


FUTURE LEGEND

 
 
And in the death 
As the last few corpses lay rotting on the slimy 
thoroughfare 
The shutters lifted in inches in Temperance Building 
High on Poacher s Hill 
And red, mutant eyes gaze down on Hunger City 
No more big wheels 
 
Fleas the size of rats sucked on rats the size of cats 
And ten thousand peoploids split into small tribes 
Coverting the highest of the sterile skyscrapers 
Like packs of dogs assaulting the glass fronts of Love Me Avenue 
Ripping and rewrapping mink and shiny silver fox, now legwarmers 
Family badge of sapphire and cracked emerald 
Any day now 
The Year of the Diamond Dogs 
 
 This ain t Rock n Roll 
This is Genocide 


 


GEMINI SPACESHIP

 (Legendary Stardust Cowboy) 
 
I took a trip 
on a gemini spacecraft 
And I thought about you 
I passed through the shadow of Jupiter 
And I thought about you 
I shot my spacegun 
And boy, I really felt blue 
 
Two or three flying saucers 
Parked under the stars 
The winding stream 
Moon shining down 
On some little town 
And with each beam 
The same old dream 
 
I took a trip 
on a gemini spacecraft 
And I thought about you 
I shot my spacegun 
And I thought about you 
I pulled down my sun visor 
Boy, I really felt blue 
 
You jumped into your Gemini 
I jumped into mine 
We'll orbit the moon 
For just one time 
Tomorrow night 
Tomorrow night 
Will you hold hands 
With me in the moonlight 
 
I took a trip 
in a gemini spacecraft 
And I thought about you 
I shot my spacegun 
And I thought about you 
I took 
I took a walk in space 
Boy, I really felt blue 
 
Well, I peeked through the crack 
And I looked way back 
The stardust trail 
Leading back to you 
What did I do 
What could I do 
Yes what did I do 
 
Well 
I thought about you 
I thought about you 
Took a trip 
on a gemini spacecraft 
Thought about you 


 


GLASS SPIDER

 
 
Up until one century ago there lived, 
In the Zi Duang province of eastern country 
A glass like spider 
Having devoured its prey it would drape the skeletons 
over its web 
In weeks creating a macabre 
Shrine of remains 
Its web was also unique in that it had many layers 
Like floors in a building 
 
At the top of this palace like place, assembled with 
almost apparent 
Care, were tiny, shining objects, glass, beads, dew drops 
One could almost call it an altar 
When the breeze blew 
thru this construction 
It produced sounds of wailing, crying 
Tiny wails, tiny cries 
 
The baby spiders would get scared and search frantically for their mother. 
But the Glass Spider would have long gone, having known that the babies 
Would survive somehow 
on their own. 
Oh The Glass Spider had blue eyes almost like a human's. 
They shed tears at the wintered turn of the centuries. 
 
Don't you hear this wasted cry, 
Life is over you 
(Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone) 
But you've seen who's in heaven. Is there anyone in hell 
(Mummy come back 'cause it's dark now) 
Take care, take care. 
(Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone) 
 
Somewhere she glows divine. Somewhere she wakes alone. 
But you, you've promise 
in your lovin' eye. 
 
God it's dark now. 
 
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah 
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah 
 
Gone, Gone the water's all gone 
Mummy come back 
'cause the water's all gone 
Stay low on the ground, fire can drive you, 
savage and afraid 
Spitting the dawn, come come come along 
before the animals awake 
Run, run, we've been moving all night, rivers to the left. 
If your mother don't love you then the riverbed might 
Gone, gone, the water's all gone 
Mummy come back 
'cause the water's all gone 
 
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah 
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah 
 
Gone gone the water's all gone 
Mummy come back 
'cause the water's all gone 


 


GOD KNOWS I'M GOOD

 
 
I was walking through the counters of a national concern 
And a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder 
 
And I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean 
As the merchandise exchanged and money roared 
And a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak 
Into the paper bag at her side 
And her face was white with fear in case her actions were observed 
So she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind 
 
Crying 
 God knows I'm good 
God knows I'm good 
God knows I'm good 
God may look the other way today 
 
God knows I'm good 
God knows I'm good 
God knows I'm good 
God may look the other way today 
 
Then she moved toward the exit clutching tightly at her paper bag 
Perspiration trickled down her forehead 
And her heart it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder 
She was led away bewildered and amazed 
Through her deafened ears the cash machines were shrieking on the counter 
As her escort asked her softly 
for her name 
And a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady 
Who had fainted to the whirling 
wooden floor 
 
Crying 
 God knows I'm good 
God knows I'm good 
God knows I'm good 
Surely God won't look 
the other way 
 
God knows I'm good 
God knows I'm good 
God knows I'm good 
Surely God won't look 
the other way 


 


GOD ONLY KNOWS

 (Brian Wilson/Tony Asher) 
 
If you should ever leave me 
My life would still go on believe me 
The world could show nothing to me 
So what good would living do me 
God only knows what I'd be without you 
 
I may not always love you 
But as long as there are 
stars above you 
You'll never need to doubt it 
I'll make you so sure about it 
God only knows what I'd be without you

GOODBYE MR. ED

 . Sales/T. Sales) 
 
The ghost of Manhattoes 
Shrieking as they fall 
From AT&T 
Someone sees it all 
Goodbye Mr. Ed 
Andy's skull enshrined 
In a shopping mall near Queens 
Someone sees it all 
 
Icarus takes his pratfall 
Bruegel on his head 
Goodbye Mr. Ed 
 
Four and twenty black kids 
Some of them are blind 
Someone sees it all 
Tolerance of violence 
By the fellows with no heads 
Goodbye Mr. Ed 
 
CHORUS (twice) 
Some things are so big 
They make no sense 
Histories so small 
People are so dense 
Someone sees it all 
Goodbye Mr. Ed 
 
Never mind the Pistols 
They laid the Golem eggs 
Others came to hatch them 
Outside the pale 
Someone sees it all 
Goodbye Mr. Ed

HANG ON TO YOURSELF

collector 
Layin' on 'lectric dreams

Well come on, well come on 
If you think we're gonna make it 
You better hang on to yourself

We just ball and play 
But then we move like tigers on vaseline 
Well the bitter comes out better on a stolen guitar 
You're the blessed, we're the Spiders from Mars

Waiting for something 
Looking for someone 
Is there no reason? 
Have I stared too long?

And when the sun is low 
And the rays high 
I can see it now 
I can feel it die

HEAVEN'S IN HERE

between the blade and the tongue 
Of the rose on your cheek, the wounded and dumb 
We stumble and fall we stumble and fall 
Skin on skin but there's heaven in... 
 
CHORUS 
Heaven's in here (x2) 
Among the twilight and stars 
Like a rocket to mars 
Heaven in here 
 
The first and the last are telling it all 
Telling you loud but selling it small 
I'm taking a swing 
at this shadow of mine 
Crucifix hangs an' my heart's in my mouth .... But it's here 
 
CHORUS 
Heaven in one sigh 
Heaven in two eyes 
 
Heaven lies between your marbled thighs 
The rustle of your falling gown 
We stumble and fall 
like tragedy falls 
We stumble and twirl 
there's heaven in here 
We stumble and fall uncertain we fall 
Flesh on flesh but there's heaven in... 
Heaven's in here 
 
CHORUS 
You'll dance to my tongue 
we'll dance on the sun 
We're the twilight and stars 
There's heaven in here 


 


HERE COMES THE NIGHT

Ohhhhh... here it comes 
Here comes the night 
Yeah, here comes the night 
Oh, yeah (here comes the night) 
 
I can see right out my window walking down the street my girl 
With another guy 
His arms around her 
like it used to be with me 
Oh it makes me want to die 
 
CHORUS 
Yeah, here it comes 
Here comes the night 
Yeah, here comes the night 
Yeah... (here comes the night) 
 
There they go, funny how they look so good together 
Wonder what is wrong with me 
Why can't I accept 
the fact she's chosen him 
And simply let them be? 
 
CHORUS 
 
Oh she's with him 
they're turning down the lights 
Now he's holding her the way I used to do 
I can see her closing her eyes 
and telling him lies 
Exactly like she told me too 
 
CHORUS (repeat ad inf.) 


 


HEROES

 I, I will be king 
And you, you will be queen 
Though nothing will drive them away 
We can beat them, just for one day 
We can be Heroes, just for one day 
 
And you, you can be mean 
And I, I'll drink all the time 
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact 
Yes we're lovers, and that is that 
 
Though nothing, will keep us together 
We could steal time, 
just for one day 
We can be Heroes, for ever and ever 
What d'you say? 
 
I, I wish you could swim 
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim 
Though nothing, 
nothing will keep us together 
We can beat them, for ever and ever 
Oh we can be Heroes, 
just for one day 
 
I, I will be king 
And you, you will be queen 
Though nothing will drive them away 
We can be Heroes, just for one day 
We can be us, just for one day 
 
I, I can remember (I remember) 
Standing, by the wall (by the wall) 
And the guns shot above our heads 
(over our heads) 
And we kissed, 
as though nothing could fall 
(nothing could fall) 
And the shame was on the other side 
Oh we can beat them, for ever and ever 
Then we could be Heroes, 
just for one day 
 
We can be Heroes 
We can be Heroes 
We can be Heroes 
Just for one day 
We can be Heroes 
 
We're nothing, and nothing will help us 
Maybe we're lying, 
then you better not stay 
But we could be safer, 
just for one day 
 
Oh oh oh ohh, oh oh oh ohh, 
just for one day

 


HURT

 I hurt myself today 
To see 
if I still feel 
I focus on the pain 
The only thing that's real 
The needle tears a hole 
The old familiar sting 
Try to kill it all away 
But I remember everything 
 
What have I become? 
My sweetest friend 
Everyone I know 
Goes away in the end 
You could have it all 
My empire of dirt 
I will let you down 
I will make you hurt 
 
I wear my crown of shit 
On my liar's chair 
Full of broken thoughts 
I cannot repair 
Beneath the stain of time 
The feeling disappears 
You are someone else 
I am still right here 
 
What have I become? 
My sweetest friend 
Everyone I know 
Goes away in the end 
You could have it all 
My empire of dirt 
I will let you down 
I will make you hurt 
If I could start again 
A million miles away 
I would keep myself 
I would find a way

 


I CAN'T EXPLAIN

 (Pete Townshend) 
 
New feeling inside 
It's a hot certain kind 
I feel hot and cold 
Down in my soul, baby 
 
I can't explain 
Going out of my mind 
Dizzy in the head, and I'm feeling blue 
Things you say well maybe they're true 
I get funny dreams again and again 
Knows what it means, but 
 
Can't explain 
I think it's love 
Say it to you 
When I feel blue 
 
I can't explain, no, I can't explain 
 
You know I can't explain 
I'm going out of my mind 
Well I'm a worried guy 
But I can't explain 


 


I CAN'T READ

 (D.Bowie/R.Gabrels) 
 
I can't read and I can't write down 
I don't know a book from countdown 
I don't care which shadow gets me 
All I've got is someone's face 
 
Money goes to money heaven 
Bodies go to body hell 
I just cough, 
catch the chase 
Switch the channel 
watch the police car 
 
CHORUS 
I can't read shit anymore 
I just sit back and ignore 
I just can't get it right, 
can't get it right 
I can't read shit 
I can't read shit 
 
When you see a famous smile 
No matter where you run your mile 
To be right in that photograph 
Andy where's my fifteen minutes

We move like the sea 
You, you're all I want to know 
I feel free 
I feel free 
 
CHORUS (2 times) 
I can walk down the street 
there's no one there 
the pavement is one huge crowd 
I can drive down the road 
my eyes can't see 
but my mind wants to cry out loud 
 
I feel free 
 
Dance floor is like the sea 
The ceiling is the sky 
You're the sun, and as you shine on me 
I feel free (3 times) 


 


I HAVE NOT BEEN TO OXFORD TOWN

She was 14 years of age

All's well 
No I have not been to Oxford Town 
 
CHORUS 
Toll the bell 
Pay the private eye

My attorney seems sincere 
I fear my days are numbered

All's well 
But I have not been to Oxford Town 
All's well 
But I have not been to Oxford Town 
 
CHORUS 
This is your shadow on my wall 
This is my flesh and blood 
This is what I could've been 
 
And the wheels are turning and turning 
As the 20th century dies 
 
If I had not ripped the fabric 
If time had not stood still 
If I had not met Ramona 
If I'd only paid my bill 
All's well 
But I have not been to Oxford Town 
All's well 
But I have not been to Oxford Town

This is my bunk with two sheets 
This is my food though foul 
This is what I could have been

I KEEP FORGETTING

 (Leiber/Stoller) 
 
I keep forgetting 
you don't love me no more 
I keep forgetting 
you don't want me no more 
I keep forgetting 
that you told me that you 
Didn't want me around any more 
But these stupid old feet 
Just head for your street 
Like they've done so many times before 
And this stubborn old fist 
On the end of my wrist 
Keeps a knocking on your front door 
 
I keep forgetting 
you don't love me no more 
I keep forgetting 
you don't want me no more 
I keep forgetting 
bout those heartbreaking nights 
 
And those heartbreaking things 
That you said 
Though I know in my heart 
We're drifting apart 
I can't believe 
that our love is dead 
 
Though it's plain as can be 
That you're finished with me 
I just can't get it through my head

I WISH YOU WOULD

 (Billy Arnold) 
 
Early in the morning by the break of day 
That's when my baby went away 
Come back baby I wish you would 
This crying and grieving 
won't do me no good 
 
Hugging and a kissing, late at night 
You know pretty baby it feels just right 
Come back baby what you're trying to do?

I WOULD BE YOUR SLAVE

Walking in the snowy street 
Let me understand 
Drifting down a silent park 
Stumbling over land 
Open up your heart to me 
Show me who you are 
And I would be your slave 
 
Do you sleep in quietude? 
Do you walk in peace? 
Do you laugh out loud at me? 
No one else that is free 
Open up your heart to me 
Show me all you are 
And I would be your slave 
 
I don't sit around and wait 
I don't give a damn 
I don't see the point at all 
No footprints in the sand 
 
I bet you laugh out loud at me 
A chance to strike me down 
Give me peace of mind at last 
Show me all you are 
Open up your heart to me 
And I would be your slave 
 
I don't sit and wait 
I don't give a damn 
I don't see the point at all 
No footprints in the sand 
I would give you all my love 
Nothing else is free 
Open up your heart to me 
And I would be your slave

Who knows how it could be 
Be tomorrow

IF I'M DREAMING MY LIFE

 ) 
 
Was she never there? 
Was she ever? 
Was it air she breathed? 
At the wrong time 
 
All the flowers so 
From the gallery 
with the hymns of night 
Singing come to me 
At the wrong time 
On the wrong day 
All the lights are fading now 
If I'm dreaming all my life 
 
Just one living chance 
When the mother sighs 
When the father steps aside 
At the wrong time 
 
Was she never here? 
Was she ever? 
Was it air she breathed? 
At the wrong time 
On the wrong day 
All the lights are fading now 
If I'm dreaming all my life 
If I'm dreaming all my life away 
Dreaming my life 
Dreaming my (x3) 
Dreaming my life 
Dreaming my life, away (oh ho)

IF THERE IS SOMETHING

 (Ferry) 
 
If there is something 
That I might find 
Look around corners 
Try to find peace of mind, 
I say 
 Where would you go 
If you were me? 
Trying to keep a straight course 
is not easy 
 
Somebody special 
Looking at me 
Same kind of reaction 
Wanted to cry with me 
If there are many 
Too easy to say 
When it's love 
It's just a game ame ame ame 
 
I would do anything for you 
I would come all day 
I would swim all the oceans blue 
I would walk a thousand miles 
Reveal my secrets 
More than enough for me to share 
I will put roses around your door 
Sit in the garden 
Growing potatoes by the score 
 
Shake your head girl, 
with your ponytail 
Takes me right back 
[when you were young] 
Throw your precious gifts into the air 
Watch them fall down 
[when you were young] 
 
Your love could feel you put them on the ground 
It used to fall apart 
[when you were young] 
 
Your love could feel you put them on the ground 
The hills were higher 
[when you were young] 
 
Your love could feel you put them on the ground 
The trees were taller then 
[when you were young] 
 
Your love could feel you put them on the ground 
The grass was greener 
[when you were young] 
 
Your love could feel you put them on the ground 
It used to fall apart 
[when you were young] 


 


IT AIN T EASY

 (Ron Davies) 
 
When you climb to the top of the mountain 
Look out over the sea 
Think about the places perhaps, where a young man could be 
Then you jump back down to the rooftops 
Look out over the town 
Think about all of the strange things circulating round 
 
 
 
CHORUS 
It ain't easy, it ain't easy 
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down 
 
Well all the people have got their problems 
That ain't nothing new 
With the help of the good Lord 
We can all pull on through 
We can all pull on through 
Get there in the end 
Sometimes it'll take you right up and sometimes down again 
 
CHORUS 
 
Satisfaction, satisfaction 
Keep me satisfied 
I've got the love of a Hoochie Koochie woman 
She calling from inside 
She's a calling from inside 
Trying to get to you 
All the woman really wants you can give her something 
too 
 
CHORUS (x2)

I am bored from the event 
I really don't understand the situation 
And it's no game 
 
Documentaries on refugees 
Couples 'gainst the target 
You throw a rock against the road 
And it breaks into pieces 
Draw the blinds on yesterday,

Put a bullet in my brain,

To be insulted by these fascists 
it's so degrading

Shut up! Shutu 


 


IT'S NO GAME (PART 2)

 
 
Silhouettes and shadows 
watch the revolution 
No more free steps to heaven 
Just walkie talkie heaven or hearth 
Just big heads and drums full speed and pagan 
And it's no game 
 
I am barred from the event 
I really don't understand the situation 
So where's the moral 
People have their fingers broken 
To be insulted by these fascists it's so degrading 
And it's no game 
 
Documentaries on refugees, 
couples 'gainst the target 
Throw a rock against the road, 
and it breaks into pieces 
Draw the blinds on yesterday, 
and it's all so much scarier 
Put a bullet in my brain, 
and it makes all the papers 
 
And it's no game 
 
Children round the world, 
put camel shit on the walls 
 
They're making carpets on treadmills, 
or garbage sorting 
 
And it's no game 


 


JANINE

 
 
Oh my love, Janine 
I'm helpless for your smile 
Like a Polish wanderer 
I travel ever onwards to your land 
And were it not just for the jewels, I'd close your hand 
 
Your strange demand 
To 'collocate' my mind 
Scares me into gloom 
You're too intense 
I'll have to keep you in your place 
I've no defence 
I've got to keep my veil on my face 
 
Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well 
But I've got things inside my head 
That even I can't face 
 
Janine, Janine, you'd like to crash 
my walls 
But if you take an axe to me 
You'll kill another man 
Not me at all 
 
You're fey, Janine 
A tripper to the last 
But if I catch you standing on my toes 
I'll have a right to shout you down 
For you're a lazy stream 
In which my thoughts would drown 
 
So stay, Janine 
And we can glide along 
I've caught your wings for laughs 
I'm not obliged to read you statements of the year 
So take your glasses off 
And don't act so sincere 
 
Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well 
But I've got things inside my head 
That even I can't face 
 
Janine, Janine, you'd like to crash 
my walls 
But if you take an axe to me 
You'll kill another man 
Not me at all 


 


JOHN, I'M ONLY DANCING

 Well, Annie's pretty neat, 
she always eats her meat 
Joe is awful strong, 
bet your life he's putting us on 
Oh lordy, oh lordy, 
you know I need some loving 
I'm moving, touch me! 
 
(CHORUS) 
John, I'm only dancing 
She turns me on, 
but I'm only dancing 
She turns me on, 
don't get me wrong 
I'm only dancing 
 
Oh shadow love was quick and clean, 
life's a well thumbed machine 
I saw you watching from the stairs, 
you're everyone that ever cared 
Oh lordy, oh lordy, 
you know I need some loving 
I'm moving, touch me! 
 
CHORUS (x2) 
Dancing, 
won't someone dance with me? 
Touch me! Ohhh!

 


JOIN THE GANG

 
 
Let me introduce you to the gang 
Johnny plays the sitar, he s an existentialist 
Once he had a name, now he plays our game 
You won t feel so good now that you ve joined the gang 
Molly is the model in the ads 
Crazy clothes and acid full of soul and crazy hip 
Someone switched her on, then her beam went wrong 
Cause she can t switch off, now that she s joined the gang 
Arthur is a singer with a band 
Arthur drinks two bottles just before he goes on stage 
Look at Arthur rave, all the kids are paid 
They want to see the croaking man who joined the band 
You won t be alone, we ve all got beery grins 
It s a big illusion but at least you re in 
At least you re in 
This club s called The Webb, it s this month s pick 
Next month we shall find a place where prices aren t so stiff 
15 bob a coke, fraid that s past a joke 
This is how to spend now that you ve joined a gang 
This is what to do now that you re here 
Sit round doing nothing all together very fast 
Psychedelic stars, throwing down cigars 
They re picking up the joints now that they ve joined the gang 


 


JUMP (THEY SAY)

 
 
When comes the shaking man 
A nation in his eyes 
Striped with blood and emblazed tattoo 
Streaking cathedral spire 
 
 
They say 
he has no brain 
They say 
he has no mood 
They say 
he was born again 
They say 
look at him climb 
They say 'Jump' 
 
They say 
he has two gods 
They say 
he has no fear 
They say 
he has no eyes 
They say 
he has no mouth 
 
They say hey that's really something 
They feel he should get some time 
I say he should watch his ass 
My friend don't listen to the crowd 
They say 'Jump' 
Got to believe somebody 
Got to believe 


 


KINGDOM COME

 (Verlaine) 
 
 
Well I walked in the pouring rain 
And I heard a voice that cries 
 It's all in vain 
The voice of doom 
was shining in my room 
I just need one day 
somewhere far away 
Lord I just need one day 
 
Well I'll be breaking these rocks 
And cutting this hay 
Yes I'll be breaking these rocks 
What's my price to pay? 
 
Well the river's so muddy, 
but it may come clear 
And I know too well what's keeping me here 
I'm just the slave of a burning ray 
Oh give me the night, 
I can't take another sight 
Please, please give me the night 
 
CHORUS 
 
Sun keeps beating down on me, wall's a mile high 
 
Up in the tower they're watching me hoping I'm gonna die 
 
I won't be breaking no rocks 
I said I won't be breaking no rocks 
 
(I won't be breaking no rocks) 
(I won't be breaking no rocks) 
(I won't be breaking no rocks) 
When the kingdom comes 


 


KOOKS

 
 
CHORUS (x2) 
Will you stay in our Lovers' Story 
If you stay you won't be sorry 
'Cause we believe in you 
Soon you'll grow so take a chance 
With a couple of Kooks 
Hung up on romancing 
 
We bought a lot of things 
to keep you warm and dry 
And a funny old crib on which the paint won't dry 
I bought you a pair of shoes 
A trumpet you can blow 
And a book of rules 
On what to say to people 
when they pick on you 
'Cause if you stay with us you're gonna be pretty Kookie too 
 
CHORUS 
 
And if you ever have to go to school 
Remember how they messed up 
this old fool 
Don't pick fights with the bullies 
or the cads 
'Cause I'm not much cop at punching other people's Dads 
And if the homework brings you down 
Then we'll throw it on the fire 
And take the car downtown 
 
CHORUS (repeat ad inf.) 


 


LADY GRINNING SOUL

 
 
She'll come, she'll go. 
She'll lay belief on you 
Skin sweet with musky oil 
The lady from another grinning soul 
 
Cologne she'll wear. Silver and Americard 
She'll drive a beetle car 
And beat you down at cool Canasta 
 
And when the clothes are strewn 
don't be afraid of the room 
Touch the fullness of her breast. 
Feel the love of her caress 
She will be your living end 
 
She'll come, she'll go. 
She'll lay belief on you 
But she won't stake her life on you 
How can life become 
her point of view 
 
And when the clothes are strewn 
don't be afraid of the room 
Touch the fullness of her breast. 
Feel the love of her caress 
She will be your living end (repeat) 


 


LADY STARDUST

 
 
People stared at the makeup on his face 
Laughed at his long black hair, his animal grace 
 
The boy in the bright blue jeans 
Jumped up on the stage 
And lady stardust sang his songs 
Of darkness and disgrace 
 
 
CHORUS 
And he was alright, the band was altogether 
Yes he was alright, the song went on forever 
And he was awful nice 
Really quite out of sight 
(second time: really quite paradise) 
And he sang all night long 
 
Femme fatales emerged from shadows 
To watch this creature fair 
Boys stood upon their chairs 
To make their point of view 
I smiled sadly for a love I could not obey 
 
Lady Stardust sang his songs 
Of darkness and dismay 
 
 
 
 
CHORUS 
 
Oh how I sighed 
When they asked if I knew his name 
 
CHORUS 
 
Get some pussy now! 


 


LAW (EARTHLING ON FIRE)

  
 
I don't want knowledge, 
I want certainty 
 
In the street a man shouts out loud 
A wallet drops and money flies into the midday sun 
With the sound, with the sound, 
with the sound of the ground 
Oh I get a little bit afraid 
Sometimes 
 
Earthlings on fire 
 
CHORUS 
With the sound, with the sound, 
with the sound of the ground 
Sure I get a little bit afraid 
Sometimes 
 
Earthlings on fire 
I don't want knowledge, 
I want certainty 
 
In a house a man drops dead 
As he hits the floor he sighs 
 What a morning 
 
CHORUS 
Sometimes 
Earthlings on fire

 Waterstone’s, Boston, March ’98
past yellow shoes and red ones
        and what seems a reflection of a plane, a skyscraper, and a car —
        actually painted in glitter on the sidewalk —
 
and
 
driving over the narrow river,
        peach and white tornadoes of light in the dark blue water
pairs of headlights coming towards me, Bright Eyes
 
        a suffering yet in service of
        it’s not funny
        the men laughed anyway
        so I did — laughter being ‘catchy’ —
 
what’s this black of night
not hard-looking, not soft —
mushy with molecules
 
back to the flat of the mind
 
stop sign
street lights like lollipops
 
        branch’s blue shadow in snow, today’s long melting yard
 
“you always look so young”
said Fanny and I said
something tiny
but thought
“I’m immature”
would have been funny
 
I cared for aesthetics
so I kept falling,
in love with grace and cleverness
but in the development of an argument
I’ve learned recently
are
        juxtapositions of substance
 
melancholy’s going
can’t afford it —
approaching 50
affords an opportunity
like the last half of a vacation
to make the best of itRien ne me rend plus heureux que de sortir dans la campagne et de peindre ce que je vois.
— Henri Rousseau
Aglitter in the dromedary dawn 
 with cold rubles, the old cyclone 
 boasts come what come may, sir. 
 Like a silly curlicue, for instance, 
 that you called August. It too had 
 a way, prescient and plunderable, 
 a mix of corsage and assemblage, 
 or coconut if you can imagine it.
A wax cylinder in the wind was 
 carrying us chevalierly through 
 the alphabets of petite longings, 
 our gumption of restless itching. 
 If we stop here it’s because here 
 it’s thick dusk. Streaming ribbons 
 from the sun, yellow fields of sky 
 matriculating without thinking.
Slowly, the aperture goes bronze 
 squinting in the marble harbor, 
 guffawing, crocheting a speech. 
 The morning buildings are air 
 sugared with stiff upper lip. 
 Clipped romance butters our 
 pockets with comic-book accents, 
 pocked lingo and perfumed lint.
Yesterday, the dazzlement washed us 
 away like laundry boats bedraggled
      toward a ventilated hexagon of sea, 
 its coils and plungers, its plumber’s tape
      amid lulling processions of joggers.
     One spring patio is for rodeos 
 niggled with iodine figures, weaved
      tapestries inside bat tulieries. 
 But that reminds me, how exactly 
      do words form brittle histories —
     rummaging a basement heap, a guttural 
 section, suppose, or an anatomical plane,
      a slice of what should be and has been said 
 but wasn’t, like some yogurty radio static
      giving way assuredly to sweet hosannas.
     We bench-press archways with our eyes 
 recalling a time when we actually had eyes. 
 Yes, that was eons ago, gazing inside at TV
      bunkers as Shock-&-Awe hunkered down
     for supper, a roseate ghostly assembly line 
 producing but bruise. I could use a good one c
 ome to think of it. And nickeled-and-dimed,
      halter-top waters rise. Ferries a-glint with
     restaurant dementias. Some happenstance 
 meant to be talked about. We’ll have to let be, 
 with addled doo-wop and haughty pince-nez.
      Alone here in the river walk you buoy it all.
You, walking stick, are emptier in a crowd, 
                though not as empty as one.
 Amateur, I’m watching your surveys shrug 
                to the ground, dear and ruthless. The
fiesta has begun. And waffling in the breeze, 
                this is the time to reprogram
 an ideogram or two, flinging pants off 
                for stoic sleepiness.
Dreams have the following architecture: 
                metallic substance, pursuant laws
 of mineralness. Vague plunder of booty, 
                plastic robe of pearls. Sesame
pirates of our wonderfully dull childhood 
                where a perverted man
 usurps your surname and wanders the lawn, 
                sprinkling reindeer tears.
Just as to love is to doze, so what I crave 
                is to nose about. I, however,
 in 17th-century fashion, stare at your chaps 
                of frolicking gold, apparel
that includes a spigot, which cargoes some 
                mumbling grudge in its hull
 quarters to Tribeca. There we can arrange 
                a spotted coordinate for the Star,
the strait pass that was kindred, mortal. Now 
                resume the pose. Walk, rub, walk.
It only takes a brochure in your palms to let me see 
      native Indias and corpulent Africas open gently 
 your cornet wrists, your marigold-clumped brow.
People should be able to account for something in 
      what they desire or they roam fore’er, secluded
 under western bandanas. This leads to reclusiveness.
Extreme passivity, puss ocher and the like. General 
      spiels of uneasiness. I should know, happening to be
 one myself, a curmudgeon crayfish like the Fantômas.
A board was laid out. It had your legs on it, suspended 
      scissor-like. A mode I knew from albums. Speaking
 of which, one bum was overheard saying to the other,
“I like your bum.” Quite moving mumbo-jumbo really. 
      One door slices us to the next, the tunnels funnel us
 into faraway space with pristine shops. You snicker to
friends across absolute distance. They always ask 
      me the fable of my life, the accurate one, replete
 with liquid bones to pick at or throw as testimony.
I prefer sassafras to crème brûlée on any given day. 
      Brutal and cunning, but unknown, I love cyclists.
 So a cloud curtailed me. And I awoke horizon.
The result 
 of such 
 expressiveness cannot 
 be denied. 
 Especially honey, 
 figures of 
 rain buttressing 
 cheeks with
small change — 
 contingencies due — 
 and this

 we’ll name 
 our stone-braced 
 embodiment. Neither

 The Possible.
 You once

up what? 
 A stripper 
 made in

 Boring. We

stations. 
 Calling this all 
 a pipe-dream, 
 a.k.a. Yourself,

 for our 
 lips, sandwiched 
 in stares
stuck in 
 Porta-johns. This 
 kind of

 it’s not 
 enough to 
 be relative

 art for
 the dear
and near 
 to us, 
 picking up 
 the phone 
 one day 
 saying clearly 
 but only
                                  “And?”
I take refuge in each skittery movement and moment 
      I’m given when not forced to dwell on a monument.
 Iron’s the last bastion afforded to a materialist state. 
      Next to gentle gardens, for a bit, we argued. Polluted
scales were a kind of resolution to wrestle us from 
      ourselves, though I kept noticing the way our lips
 pinched themselves accidentally, the vanity roped 
      around its waist, delicate and burnt, as if dread
had come into the room with a waltz on our breath. 
      At such gestured pace, you induce a sigh. Yes, you
 ignorant child, those fireworks were yours. And this 
      time they were. Pyrotechnics fade. Experiments not
talked about until today in the skyrise of cabinets 
      and windows of papers flustered from sunlight
 rise like a Goth girl costumed in hardened beeswax 
 whose tattoo reads Buried on the Breath of Dawn.
 
Wonder needed, patois needed, monkey brains optional. 
 Suitors needed, comforters needed, lactose-tolerance optional.
 Spray-painted suits, undulating lanterns, scenes of frantic night
 all for a checkbook that I would seize before surrendering
my love of The Real. One who will be for the future, if only 
 to turn back his long and lioned head with remorse code.
 Acknowledging acknowledgements. Like a magnet we drifted 
 in a boy’s blink for years not knowing we were drifting.
It is always dusk here. Mechanical animals wait for us. 
 We wait for each other. Berry-eyed and bituminous, a tortoise 
 of waiting and wanting, mating and pray mantising. So 
 what are you really interested in, Pythagoras?
Things as they are, or judgments? Careful, the truth’s a pill, 
 so chew before swallowing. Maybe it’s just a tromp l’oeil 
 effect, on second thought. Even so, it is what it is, and 
 what it is, we must swallow. And we do. We do.To range in the war was corruption, an error, a snow.
            A snow over Rome. Near the garage to sew and to
            sing — a crystal, inherent, and a wink to the
            chevalier.
To range in the Roman manner was to manage it raw.
The seagoer pressed by the woman in arson. The manager,
            waiting, and in the distance, at least, was wrong.
            He had played it too near and announced in answers.
            A changing is shown.
A personal letter is addressed to the seagoer. Now the
            rangers warn to swear. A reminder grows. The
            manner of the answer is warmer.
 The ram, the swarm and the wren, Ramon and Sergei, all
            wane.
Is the seagoer Negro? Arms is the song when the women
            are meaner. And the mason is worse. As the snow
             nears, the green grocer is warned. The owner of
            the organ remains behind. As in Rome, we wear
            sweaters to visit the gorge.A history of Australian Aboriginal songpoetry in English is a shadow project. Of course it exists as a thing in and of itself. But in translation, as it so often is, songpoetry can be considered symptomatic of an Anglophone poetry project. This is not to suggest there is no exchange between the country of the songs and the poetry context into which they are translated. It is surely a work of collaboration. However, what we do see when we read songpoetry in translation are the changes in Australian poetry itself — there is, for example, strict meter, rhyme, and line in the early nineteenth century, wholly replaced by freer forms of expression 150 years later. The most recent example of Aboriginal songpoetry in mainstream literary publishing is Stuart Cooke’s George Dyungayan’s Bulu Line: A West Kimberly Song Cycle (Puncher and Wattman 2014). Cooke uses changes in font, loose rhyme, minor repetition, and a free, fragmentary approach comprising short lines that recalls some classical Greek and Chinese texts as they are currently presented in the transnational Anglophonic world. In other words, this rendering by Cooke relies on a whole series of poetic choices that are themselves indicators of what is happening in poetry now not just songpoetry in its home location.
Given there are around 150 Australian Aboriginal languages still being spoken today, often by only a few hundred speakers, one reads mainly in translation. Perhaps more than other cultures, where the liberal author function is sacrosanct and where the history of colonial exploitation less pronounced, Aboriginal songpoetry in the archive often neglects the originary poet. These verses are embedded in explorers’ diaries, settlers’ letters, anthropologists’ journals, and country newspapers where the “informants” are mainly unnamed. Such is the ethnopoetic tradition as it stands here. To redefine it one must establish a counterhistory and reveal a secret anthology, which relies on reframing existing work for its sustenance and participating in cultural repatriation projects tailored to the digital era.
In presenting these texts as poetry rather than as lyrics or myth or data, we propose a different way of reading. Habits of reflection, nodes of association, expectations of nature are just some of the ways in which this reframing is discursively productive, without even mentioning the importance of examining poetic devices. The poems I have selected for this piece cover most of the geographic continent and span 150 years, which is the majority of Australian colonization. They offer a wide range of themes, styles, and devices that reorient our understandings of love, settlement, hunting, and the environment. For the most part I have simply copied them as they exist in their original written form; I have not changed line breaks or exempted words in Aboriginal languages, even as it is unclear in some of the sources themselves what those languages actually are. There are three Aranda/Arrernte songs here to demonstrate the changes in one particular language and provide some sort of focus. Similar projects could have been undertaken with songpoetry from the Pilbara, Kimberley, or Arnhem land.

My hope for Australian Aboriginal songpoetry is that there is an increase in readership, which helps create a consciousness that changes the everyday material circumstances of indigenous Australians today. Songpoetry is simply the first step in reinvigorating remote and urban homelands. Recognizing and celebrating this work also changes our ideas of what poetry has been or could be, especially with regard to translation, and the ecosystem of writing as a whole is improved by such diversification.
For more on the history of songpoetry see Stuart Cooke, “Tracing a Trajectory from Songpoetry to Contemporary Aboriginal Poetry,” in A Companion to Australian Aboriginal Literature, ed. Belinda Wheeler (London: Camden House, 2013), 88–106. There is also good work by Linda Barwick, Alan Marett, and Sally Treloyne.

Effort has been made to contact the relevant communities from which these songs come. I understand the delicate cultural practices around songpoetry and it is not my intention to disrupt this. If I have done so I apologize unreservedly and would also like to make it apparent that the presentation of these works is wholly for educational rather than commercial reasons. — R. D. Wood

The white man dropped from the sun bright sky,
For he envied the blackfellow’s land,
With greed and revenge in his restless eye,  
And disease and death in his hand.
And he grasped the forest, and he seized the strand,
And claimed the blue mountains high;
And he scours the bush with a ruthless band,
’Till its denizens trembling fly —
And his pigs and his cattle pollute the land
’Till it stinks, and the blackfellows die.

Aranda Song 
These acacia seeds
They crunch with their teeth.
 
The cold wind runs
Through the cane-grass bushes.
 
The acacias have white flower buds.
They are decked with white flower buds.
 
He has a bent back,
With his hair standing up he does with a bent back.

Aboriginal Song and Its Interpretation
Nung Ngun
Nge a runba wonung bulkura umbilinto bulwarra
Pital burra kultun wirripaug buntoa
 
Nung Ngun
Nge a runba turrama berrambo, burra kilkia
Kurri wi, raratoa yella walliko
Yula moane woinyo, birung poro bulliko
 
Nung Ngun
Nge a runba kan wullung, makaro, kokein,
Mip-pa-rai, kekul, wimbi, murr ring kirrika
Nge a runba murra ke-en kulbun kulbun murrung
 
Our home is in the gibber-gunyah (1)
Where hill joins hill on high,
Where the turrama (2) and berram bo (3)
Like sleeping serpents lie
And the rushing of wings, as the wangas (4) pass,
Sweeps the wallaby’s (5) print from the glistening grass.
 
Ours are the makoro (6) gliding
Deep in the shady pool;
For spear is sure, and the prey is secure.
Kanin (7) or the bright gherool (8)
Our lubras (9) sleep by the bato (10) clear
And the Amygest’s (11) track hath never been near.
 
Ours is the koolema (12) flowing,
With precious kirrika (13) stored;
For fleet the foot and keen the eye
That seeks the nukkung’s (14) hoard;
And the glances are bright and the footsteps are free
When we dance in the shade of the karrakon (15) tree.

From “A Drama of North Eastern Arnhem Land”
The white gidgid bird is hunting fish,
It stabs the fish with its beak and calls as it flies,
It stoops low over the water looking for fish,
As the fish leaps away in fear,
“You and I, mother seagull, we fly.”
The bird saw the east wind blow as it hunted fish,
And the fish leapt forward in fear,
Leaping away from its beak as the wind came blowing.

Clouds of smoke arise

“Load the muzzle. Fire!”
Clouds of smoke arise
“Sword and powder!”

I am red like a burning fire:
I am covered with glowing red down.
I am red like a burning fire:
I am gleaming red, glistening with ochre.
I am red like a burning fire:
Red is the hollow in which I am lying.
I am red like the heart of a fire:
Red is the hollow in which I am lying
A tjurunga is standing upon my head;
Red is the hollow in which I am lying.

I was camping on Bilin Bilin, a strong wind blowing
I see Thaawirdi Gorge
I take flight
The wind over the coast is rushing through
Over the Bilin Bilin.
 
A tree touches me, I see fire light
I am loaded full with power.
I see them dancing, stamping on the wet broken ground
I see the dancing ground now
I near a great beating rhythm
I see two of us traveling together through a whirlwind of fires,
I rest.
Then again I see the road follow
The world touches me, the world touches me with fire
I am loaded with power, dancing, dancing
 
Dark pools of water standing on Jingingayirnanha
I feel tired now
I give my dreams to the water
The wind is blowing hard across Jingingayirnanha
Where the water stands.

Kaporilya, such a beautiful spring
Kaporilya, its water so sweet
God in heaven makes it flow
 
 
A long time ago in Ntaria
Severe drought gripped the land
The ground was bare and no food
Many people died
 
Missionary Albrecht thought deeply
And earnestly prayed to Jesus
Together with all the old people
They saw the suffering of everyone
 
They built a long water pipeline
From Kaporilya to Ntaria
Through hard limestone and soft sand
The men worked long and hard
 
Armstrong, Ratara, and Inkamala
Rabaraba, Emitja
Malbunka, Ngalaia, Pareroultja
All the men were working
 
The water came, the people rejoiced
Everyone became well and alive
Today we all thank Jesus
He is the water of life

 
 
‘Verse 2’ of Bulu Line
Dyungayan:
guwararrirarri yinanydina
dyidi yarrabanydyina
nanbalinblai yinanydina
Cooke:
a flock of snipes
flying toward us
wait! they’re rai
   fast approaching
we nearly collide
                    their bellies like birds’
wait their flying
        belly-up
becoming rai
racing through sky
flying towards us
 from far away
birds becoming rai
      no more distance
nearly on top of us
     watch out!
the snipes are
  flying toward us
we watch snipe become rai
   flying belly up …
 — Mahāprajñāpāramitā
But somewhere caught inside
the skeined string knots some bulb of decision —
            tired crying out knife marks at myself
            within footsteps footsteps
                                                            move the street
quietly forever — I only speak to myself;
            utter fatigue of brain wound
where some animal left the tangled-up ball of cord.
Inside still one solid piece in the middle,
            still    still?    At the end of long long
staring down to this faith of constant
            consonance. And all I have ever known
the cardboard boxes my time has given me
            dust in layers
            between inherent generosity
and myself.
 
The curtain of rain that hasn’t come,
            because I want it cooler today, to end
            heat ending activity —
and this corner I look down on constantly —
I even seize the trees for living wage of syrup
            for my palms, for the staring, for the eyes above all
            as if I could not hear or taste or feel that
            shrank disgust and gave me lightning —
and place the trees …
                                            but place, place: I that move,
starfaced mole pushing, even my leaves
in the gutter — how? That does not yield
salvation — and all the manipulation
            even slashing the dead canvases of ancestors
gives nothing to know the blinding milk sugared eyes
            to live in the world, in.
 
And the heat ends activity. I am, still.
            The I want    I want    I want    anyone tortures with
            in these streets, the hoped for burned up pasts
            into everything, futures:  to live we have to burn
            even one minute to hold on to forever, exist around one
            pinhead and a paper of pins stretched out to death.
But I can’t explode even once. No.
Where will I look out? And
all to the death we want to hide. Look away, look away.
 
It is not crucifixion anymore, no blood to spurt, no world
enduring, no anguishes for anyone, turning the corner.
            Everywhere. I look toward the summer
            burning even the tonsils, to shout, to urinate into the earth
myself back into myself, the home soil dirtying my own soft hair.
            But everywhere: and this too, this poem, a path backwards into
            the twisted brush so no one will see —
                                                                                   either to look away,
whether it is brilliant nights alive alive
or fervent union with a private earth,
                                                                       or sink into ice
at the mind’s center —
                                            I cannot look at death toward the open crest
                      it is my end, but not my bones, not my mirror, never sweet beard,
                                    never the trickle of happiness.
 
Ha! that we want to live.
The heavy opaque eyeball weights us down.
            I can’t fly. I can’t sink into myself.
And where I turn this street glance up toward my room,
glance outward at the world like yellow birds and landscape on my walls —
            the wall, the wall, beyond me like my hands.
 
 Note on the text: Page  numbers and section breaks in this searchable Word transcript have been   editorially imposed. The three sections are determined by changes in   Barbara Rosenthal’s tearing/slicing/knife-cutting patterns. In   unpublished correspondence, Rosenthal identifies the points in Weiner’s   text where the pattern and/or tool alters. To create section 1 (from   “forthcoming and absolutely” to “no one can eliminate a particle”),   Rosenthal placed a steel straightedge on the page in sequenced parallels   and grasped at the paper in the lower corner with her right hand,   bearing down on the steel with her left and pulling upward to form   straight rips with a slightly textured edge; to create section 2 (from   “read more about it in the papers” to “absence of time between 5 and   7”), she used an X-Acto #2 fine point blade to slice concentric or   nested angles or rectangles; and to create the final section, she used a   combination of these techniques: the pages from “renunciation and   something else” to “she writes not me like this,” here simply labeled   “Section 3,” were created with the straightedge, and the pages from “the   insatiable quotient quote” to “love come to a,” here labeled “Section   3a,” were created with an X-Acto knife.
Note on the title: The unconventional capitalization of the word “Of” in Hannah Weiner’s The Book Of Revelation has been retained here. Although we cannot be certain that the  capitalization is intentional, Weiner did type the title on the white  label she then affixed to the notebook’s cover. The tension between the  typed, all-caps title and the handwritten pages in which a capital  rarely appears is provocative.

Dear Hannah,
Happy New Year!
Love, 1989

[Section 1]
(1)
forthcoming and absolutely
(2)
important only to those
(3)
sunshine is almost
without
(4)
something else that isn’t
substitute
(5)
a cross between a fox
and a bear
mere sensationalism since
(6)
underneath it all shone
indelicacy is a noble assignment
speak so no one will listen
(7)
whatever made you say
that!
alas!
something else could happen here
(8)
subsequent to this
observation
nevertheless we have our beliefs
dont ignore the garbage
never forget that you are identified
(9)
passages are infinite
so is this vacation
probably not too much
forgotten disciplines
remember everything
have you learned
substantive arrogance
(10)
somewhere else lies a secret
not everything is known
a person is indifferent
so many lies tell stories
satisfaction is important
nevertheless we can obliterate
constancy is a terrible problem
(11)
pretenses are seldom unalterable
patience is fortune’s caretaker
seldom has heredity struck
the ultimate importance of ingénue
the incapacity to make sense
everlasting pine trees on a calm day
suddenly everything went blue
however I cant decide anymore
everything equal comes to an end
speculation is a joint venture
(12)
alternatives are fashionable
general intelligence isn’t a mistake
special references can be made
I am always indolent in a
late day craziness is almost
terrified of all consequences
carefully we cross inbetween
idealism is an opportunity
cant you concentrate on getting anything at all
(13)
influences are opportunities
subsequent to examination
alienation is a cause
inevitable has a certain strain
opportunities are unanimous
falsification is a ritual
untidiness breeds habits
beneficial to the unemployed
alternating waves of fluency
in a trap just like the others
personalities are not permitted here
(14)
we are not concerned about
in places the rainfall is very wet
Indications point to the left
in a very important circumstance I cry
all life cannot be imported
fraudulent use of time
make believe wisdom
I cant feel the power anymore
songs may at last be inherited
too many people tell me it is impossible
(15)
fortunately there are circumstances
absence is always luminous
forget everything I ever said
some containers are inflamable
just discuss it quietly
dawn is inconsequential
everyone cant believe
unlikely to happen
please dont admit
foreclosure
understand
remote
hold
the
is
(16)
please give up all consideration
thoroughness is a consequence
waiting too long for it to happen
so many people have a long way
temptations go wild at last
inevitability recurrance
constantly without the
imagination justifies
cross reference impulses
uninhabitable now
disreferentia
upside down
conflicted
remorse
unstable
too loose
with
{fe}
(17)
without impulses to grow on
plenty of time to experiment
happily the results complain
indecisions are the fruit of delicacy
she cant stand the consequences
undeniably a certain strain
positive forces are the equivalent
infectious without pretension
remote unless prohibited
also unclear to many
something has to help
without prejudice
trying it on hard
very intermediate
softly once
cant do it
whatever
since
but
a
(18)
consequences are unjustified
temperature rises above normal
whenever clouds interfere twice
informality brings us green
temptation to become valid
progress is a mistake below
conflicts arise from indifference
sensations apply to a rose
coming inbetween us again
alienation is a round a bout form
consider the opposite happening
take care that you dont go too often
a close decision was down
semi-attached to a fit
unlikely to succeed
beginning again also
forwith permitted to
unconscious over
signals confuse
obfuscation
careful to
solidify
tempt
called
from
it
(19)
indefinite resolution to forget
tomorrow incapable of substance
fortune tellers infinitely
without any independence
autonomy is an experience
behaviour is uptown
sensations intimate
varieties of wild
concentration
more of a show
sensless of
reminder

folks

(20)
obliterations are enjoyable
removal of all objects required
limitations are interfearing late
fortunately irrelevancies decline
insensible to collusion with
pressures are inconsolable
acquisitions are unforgivable
nerveless throughout
a horror of pretense
an honor of patience
endurance prohibited
the golden aura
fools believe
sequential
automatic
anonymous
lasting
eager
bond
over
no
(21)
the late irreducible formality
brilliantly without a system
cancel every reminder of it
consideration is absent from form
overlooking a view of insanity
melody informant of cue
overturned in return by a charm
the fallacy of quaint ideas
forgetting the better blind
almost hysterically above
unanimously undone
recurrently simple
inaccurate and so
very capabable
to be too soon
formality
unrelieved
abandoned
surplus
power
turn
bow
so
(22)
bonded to a neutrality calm
notwithstanding the elegance
symetry has been condoned once
over controlled without simple
undeniably an appetite inactive
forcefully to come to conclusion
the unwavering fondness of sea
solely to perform one instant
aggravated by constant cure
only a moth can perceive it
integrated storms rise
forget the irreconcilable
not too many ways to
listen unconsolably
everything is able
inconsistency for
the measure of
useless words
unmeaning
remodel fast
drop it now
balance
livid
time
ok
(23)
endurance is a respectable sin
from one time to another we
consequently there is medium
obliterate obsessions locally
forget every device for learning
inevitable results linger on
the space is almost required
a burst of infiltration defined
nevertheless I was inconsolable
tragedies occur up side down
guess what happens next
underneath it all it all
sometimes theres a play
indifference coincides
an idea begins to show
purity is a question
definitely poor
without surprise
indeterminate
leaving
contest
diary
seem
luck
in
(24)
pretenses are unalterable
the sequence is obnoxious
many have left here
pain is not to be considered
almost again we have
with us without complaint
society has made a definite
giving up requires failure
too many aspects of this
formidable without restraint
anti-capitalism comes first
no more required dociers
once more we sing bridges
overcome with immaculate
the terror is something small
all experience is expendable
(25)
to decide limits your future
changes cannot be made twice
sensations become harmony
unalterable facts withheld
too many silent watchers
give up the end of the sentence
withholding information slowly
its only another idea to do
uninhabitable in three generations
permanence is restrictive
falling down in a blue suit
contrasts make a definition
unacustomed to a reality
before we begin upside
temporarily without repetition
a nominal form of being
concrete reluctant to form
informal geraniums {blow}
happiness is also a habit
(26)
formidable and softly
more coming than we thought
somehow we give up early
nobody understands the instant
a rejection that interferes only
anywhere else would have been
privacy is not allowed anymore
consideration for an ability
consolation is without enterprise
certainty projects desirability
inevitability of propulsion
adaptability confuses screens
foremost is the pronoun it
absolutely the only path to take
nonsense is only a bit of understanding
comfort is a redeemable pleasure
loveliness is inconsequential
inevitability is a standard
cross references become useful
never forget the incomplete
behave as if you were once young
transmit occassions on also
demand acceptance ineptly
force altruism conceded
(27)
substance requires alienation
forfeit all sentences ending
further delay reminds me of it
a consequence believes us
alliances become impervious to
the reluctance of consistency
the lead comes from the heart
the suddenness of capitulation
correlative determination
business without bond
obliteration of molecules
contrasting phenomena do
the only way out is admissible
contrasts are unanimous
the elimination of subject
sensory completeness for it
doubtless concentration helps
conservation of virtues
behaviour without program
purpose is decipt subjected
obstinacy combines plagerism
wakefulness and decision
propositions of failure
(28)
probability determines chance
one less to think about today
forever a favorite insulation
absence is a prominent conclusion
too many broke people cry out
independence is a tolerance factor
waves of instability lessen
inconsiderate and within
something else began again
ability to concentrate lightly
some distance from the whole
forgiven for not holding on
expecting delicious surprises
fundamentals dont cry
inhibitions lack lazyness
repetition requires defense
solitude is without form
fortunately too many apples
not to be without remembrance
steadily overcoming slow
one time only upside down
curiosity in formal dress
absolutely no concessions
unstable singing low
(29)
persistence requires illumination
stubbornness meets requirements
less than enough is the usual
fourteen acts of bravery village
sometimes I think without wondering
too many consistencies relinquish
absolute freedom finds a form
empty solutions are regenerated
secrets can be kept momentarily
implications are forecast also
tenderness is applicable here
judging the concept of lying
fortunately he could remember
I cant seem to believe in anything
too many commodities hurt
all at once she saw the ending
describe a situation deluxe
pretend you cant understand
forget all previous encounters
reform society to equal
a mediator has gained praise
certain tendencies were ignored
the formal application of freedom
some chance is taken Monday
too many people too many people
(30)
consult someone who knows
remind yourself of intolerance
put away those stupid phrases
ignore everything that happens
happiness is permissable once
forgive me for not talking to you sooner
obliterate intentions of blank
fundamentals are out of the way
calling for help requires a voice
too many birds have flown here
in another year the result will vanish
behave by discontent and surprise
a mirror without any reflection
totally seductive and in reverse
qualities tell us we are going away
jealously is locally unstable
forget permanence or the future
understand only one thing please
consideration for all beings was taught
exaggerate principals systematically
overload will cause confusion
upside down is a good way
many times I spoke to you of
letting everything go was at last
consider the power of the land
an unfortunate occurance took
sometimes she succeeds
there’s plenty of thought for
tiresome rituals become rare
(31)
red diaper baby
(32)
flagrant delusions
optimal suspense
(33)
courtesy for all others
sentiment is not brave
no excuses in the spring
foretelling is not always forbidden
some day you rode a horse
coming home is a venture
(34)
save all the surprises for you
tonight we can expect anarchy
in one moment I will tell you
forty nine people cannot stand
the beginning was a little bore
expect little help from midgets
in some sense all words travel
there must be no suspicion
dont ally yourself with imps
(35)
no future without importance
a second look into the closet
no reminders of inconsistency
partially incomplete in form
nonsense can be betrayed
average abilities just belong
give up your hopes of failure
despise credentials in folders
speak about your past history
change nothing until the order
prospects are becoming red
(36)
also we have been behaving
stumbling across the yellow line
plenty of time to think silly
theory just backs us up
modern technology becomes live
fortunately only three people believe
condescension is a form of surplus
some of the pieces will be pure
no one can understand excuses
second thoughts are for children
you must destroy all consequences
instead of two there were four
consistency is a summer tone
complete the requirements before
(37)
hopefully I can change my form

to blendIf there is one concern in my work, it is to reduce the form to the minimum necessary in order to visualize a thought or idea. Tomas Schmit put it like this: “What you can say with a sculpture you do not need to build as architecture, what you can do with a drawing you do not need to search in image, and what you can clear up on a piece of paper does not need to become a huge drawing; and what you can make up in your mind does not even need any piece of paper.”[1] This is something I can definitely relate to. In general, I try to keep a certain simplicity or minimalism both in writing and in visual expression, as well as in realizing the final object. This minimizing of means is also intended as a countermovement against today’s massive flood of information and waste of material; my ideal would probably be a continual reduction towards almost nothing. — Cia Rinne

Nico Vassilakis returns to Jacket2 with a new feature on the current state of visual poetry in Finland. “There’s a stir going on, a textual free-for-all, a visible shift in how language is being handled in response to the machines in our lives,” he notes. “In Finland, visual poetry, in some way, sprang up almost fully formed. There are few antecedents that point to its appearance, yet here it is. The fully mature mingle with the nascent and in so doing form a new constellation of visual poetries.”a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  j  k  l  m  n  o  p  q  r  s  t  u  v  w  x  y  z

If a line leafs, as leaves follow flowers
fading before they have ever happened,
that is spring, and this is language.
A simultaneity happens that has never happened —
speaking to you now of magnolias
edging brown before description —
before description allows itself to be enacted
before magnolias transition from winter bud, possibly
to scatter on sidewalk. Before us, before we
have walked over them before us. They develop in
time that moves through us, even as we move against
it, losing a day as we float backward past datelines and
equators, in time that moves whether in space or in motion
that time is in our body, and while in our minds, which
are energies made of an incessant construction of the various
entities of our body rubbing against each other in constant
reorganization of combustion and transmission — even in
our mind-energies, there is only simultaneity — our multiple
consciousness frames events as one happening relational, the trip
10 years ago jostles the plan for employment — memory
is future — we remember as to be able to travel forward — if
we do not, would not, dwell in the past we become disorganized
our parts no longer able to communicate: communication depends on
electrical flash mobilized from pt. A to pt. B and instantly back
again creating a simultaneous line of both and all directions,
even affecting all the points, creating not a circle but a woven
sphere within spheres and triangle and all ovoid, rectangles, elliptical —
cohered into a cone that travelled through by plane then wears
on the body, again the body is time in that these instantaneous,
multidirectional, simultaneous communiqués show by their
energies, or no, there is no cause right now to find. Instead, display
what seems to be a passage of time thru the body, but the
body is time — nothing passes through it, time is not a river
but the body in beautiful entropy, is of it, not just in it,
Cannot be described in conjunction or as other.
Just body/time without equal sign. But nature is a temple,
filled with living pillars, the flat plane passes through the cone
made of many geometric parts, the cone is altered, the plane
has passed through and has not happened yet, the plane is memory
and the cone is what is being assembled, always under construction,
a collection of tangents, and as plane passes through, small pieces
cling to it, journeying elsewhere and leaving cone eroded, as
living pillars speak in blurry languages, what they say is mistranslated
they may be in the temple of nature, or of it, or the temple is
where time becomes the entity we always imagined it to be,
something separate and comprehensible in that separation
from us, to be able to stand apart like a pillar and observe, even if
for one second, a second occurring with all the other seconds
around it, companionably, to make a minute that occurs with
all the other minutes, to take a hold of, like grabbing a river,
That which exactly what it is not and therefore maybe might be.
The space between eye and eye elided in transmission
of gazing at self in a mirror and looking once and
at the other organ of vision, the brain compensates and reaches
conclusion before induction has even laddered.              The nights let us have leaves
 
                       we have them           the leaves have let us
 
            & then they let us
 
                                     smaller
 (toll)  
To sentence is to seizure.
(that much we agree on?)
A caesura cut in               space/a splice 
                 or white ribbon tying 
                 & untying anguish 
                 to language. 
“What then is the size of the loss?” 
Is it measured by the darkness of the archives
where each word clings
                 tenuously
to its orbital aura — a page, a scrap
                 a frayed map
singed at the edges, standing wave
                  reverb.
Catapult, elegy, expenditure. 
“Every word teeming and bereft.”
Murmur nocturne, weep aubade.  
 
 
(pledge)  
At night the <altered> precise
possibilities for <stopping> speaking
dissolve <persist> into the whiteness
joining a blink & a <disjointed> waver —         
“the beyond         
 is in the          
surface”        
weaving calliope migraine
to reclaim the remnant, translating
the dead out of their rubbleinto a language of messianic
                                                                                                      shimmer 
Yeah, but the old franchise on dulcor 
                 is kaput. 
 
 
(torques) 
“To thread thru rant/a wire”
                “to write just small, though hungry” 
To fall asleep
                in the low ghost’s
strange hope
                for words. 
A question
                mark makes 
a world by 
                marring. 
But living is what comes before
the amends for living.
                After is for making
                the broken into
letters that can
                regather
                the scattered.
A poem is a séance
between any
two persons.
A point anywhere along a line
running from ruin to gift.  
 
 
(pitch) 
“All serifs are seraphim,” folded in the 
margins, the unruly dream 
of a text that would 
mend an alphabet. 
But if A = null-a 
the impossible repair will
                  always be deferred.  
Aptly, the trace of 
disaster scores 
what it carries —
                a continual sonata for
escaping 
                entropy. 
                Splathed across
its full range, it lights
itself by
                fracture.
Jagged hosannahs where
                enigma becomes kerygma.
 
 
(surge)

Is this a book?
                No, but each letter’s
                                a rift/in the hinge
                                of the text.
Distance elides us. Letters recombine.
God, according to the Sefer Yetzirah, only needed 22 to create the entire world — 
how very thrifty of him! But we grow older in letters, wearied by them, worried 
by them — how do we re-invent the letter?
 
                                Inside
the vacant room the letter
                                drops to the floor.
                The white saw of its ash
                cuts a groove
in the grain of the wood.
                And the operable lexicon is swarming with bad apples.
Yet disaster is also
song, its splendid
crowbar
                smashing windows, prying locks
cobbling
thatness out of shatteredness. 
A spidered quire barbed with
                fonts of sunlight. A
gathering of signatures crowned
                with burst bind.
Everything’s outside the textand that
 
 the reticulated
        would be kind embryology
 
held for students
 
& students would be ubiquitous for they would be aloft
 
for him
in him as lexicon
 
he betters all essential students
          & they don’t fray
not withstanding o craft the unbearable
o craft, will the world get better?
 
curious and listen, the voices
inside the character what do they want
 
violence surrounds, and endarkening & he stays

The Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics
Summer Writing Program 2013I. Of the Dead
 
March was the month when fissures opened.
It was a completely clean hallucination. It all made a kind of sense.
Larger rifts were earth wide. Smaller were local hairline cracks. There were multiple scales 
of events, unsorted, uneven.
Who can evaluate the destabilizing, limp paralysis, the thin shim under the everyday, and 
then the worse normalization?
She said “the canary in the mine field.” The phrase was totally logical.
“Mann geboren frei ist” had been graffito’d on the train station. The “chains” clause was left 
uncited. 
Water poured into the streets, dragging everyone under. Drought became endemic 
desertification, humus to dust.
Poetic autonomy never existed. In a few weeks, a dead zone had to be declared.
Any yeast that’s left will take decades to work.
The instruments are ghosts of themselves.
 
Here include the base and superstructure of me. But of course can’t draw a line, one on one 
side.
What is being breathed, when breathing in this air?
The interconnections among things remained unspoken, untraceable, inextinguishable, like 
the smell of mold. 
Chains are cumbersome, enslaving; links are necessary, and some are irrevocable.
When it gets revealed as jerry-built decisions, poor oversight, technological hubris, 
malfeasance and profiteering, then deflect attention.
To what, depends on site-specific calibrations: to claims of your “excessive” anger, to 
formally choreographed “apologies,” to crimes of mimesis, to saleable scandals and 
titillations. Occasional scapegoating. Scatters of random amulets. Perhaps analysis. The odd 
exemplary sentence. Exchanges of experts.
 
Slowly I leave a much-loved place I probably won’t return to.
What is the target genre? “Stony rubbish”? This is a textbook case. Hold on tight.
The question of bees. The question of bats.  
“Nature suddenly appeared like an emptied room.” Pencil marks up the wainscoting, some 
child’s sizes, dates. The room, however, was splintered, the child crushed.
“Do you please remember me?” the long-ago asked from her shadow.
This is a collective though partial account, after the detonation of frameworks.
So carefully biting around the meaty pericarp of Apple, she stood there.
That woman is called irksome.
It might even snow, end March, early April.

When Three Mile Island went, everyone stood outside and became an instant expert on the 
prevailing winds.
The surge in the discursive system was so enormous that one could not walk, drink, eat, even 
breathe without feeling endangered by its uncontrolled electricity.
What’s in it? What’s in it for them? But these questions eroded, frayed, abraded.
Then the actual system surfaced, with its un-degradable plastic, with “odds and ends in 
constant flux manipulated by desire and fear.”
Some have deliberately made the seeds infertile. This is a consequence of profit taking.
The future will wonder “what the fuck were they thinking.”
 
Three languages, but now she could not speak, a symptom of her dying.
Olfactory hallucination as I wake: the smell of coffee brewing.
Being “born,” as Olson said, “not of the buried but these unburied dead.” “You must change 
your life.” Me alone, or who?  
Poetry — something “replete with signifiers and gibberish.” Makes a kind of sense.
They are predicting a lot of snow up the East Coast.
But I don’t feel bad. Can’t apologize (too much) for this pock-marked landscape. 
Nevertheless, I feel terrible. “Why? April is the coolest month!” Can you say “parallel 
universe”? 
Occasional flowering is a normal characteristic. The poem’s not about the baby Christ child 
just because the word frankincense is in it. 
Severe choices of brilliant play. Temporality happens every day.
Let’s tie the hands of the assholes.
Alternative life: orthopedic surgeon. Hobby: trekking. 
Keep your valuable properties with you at all times.
The social world drained back into the work; the dam was over-passed.
Chaos Became a Way of Life. 
Canvas bags with a special logo got distributed to the task force. 
 
Meantime, I have other plans. So to speak.
Does anyone here really know why he saw poets as “horses”?
Q. teased that he would write his memoirs and call it My Lie.
The exhibit featured a colonial baroque silver teapot in the shape of a giant turkey. That level 
of extraction was almost startling.
A “secular Jewish Pegasus” would be what?
The sheer excess of the untransparent impossible has no verb right now. Sorry. 
A long time ago, when things got bad, they’d grind up the inner layer of tree bark — pine 
only, a soft wood — and bake it with rye flour. How long ago a time was that?
Here include the dominant, residual and emergent of me.
Here, rhizomic nekuia.
 
“Let the dead bury their dead” being completely impossible — now what?  
Being half-dead — a strained, self-estranged under-acknowledged fear? Particular “end of 
world” apocalyptic prophecies get media play.
On the other hand, the radioactive waste and debris will arrive on these shores in about one 
year. With the bare hands — plus a few pair of latex gloves to go around. Sea to shining sea.
Our lives are privatized, all except our private lives. This has been reviewed and is legal.
Are there real differences between here and there?
The sand was pocked and garbaged with tar clumps. Will we rupture and pull to shreds the 
ribbon of life simply by default?
Even those one wished to idealize were full-scale despoilers.
It would starve you more slowly.
 
We live here in this time, saturated with a few other times, and some few people. We’re 
friends or whatever. The between is where we are.
This is a confused sadness, where you can’t even feel that sadness.
The page, the door, the wall; whatever can be learned, it’s pinholes, although “the word,” she 
said, “leads inward into itself.” This is only half the story, although perhaps the more 
attractive half.
We’re propelled into linked emergencies with unintended fallout.
 
My skin imagines lines —
there’s me and him, and
me and it, her, us, you, and the time
we have been together when we’ve
foraged in what is, and
some things got smashed, and
some are rejoined, and
we quote from each other,
sister and brother.
Do not turn away.
 
Reader, if any! We are a symptom.
We are mirrors of our own corpses.
This is closest to darkness.
Surrender to it.
 
II. Gamut
 
The stone, as in all Moravian cemeteries, was exactly equal to the others, set flush with the 
ground. But I found it by the shells encircling her name. Chatter to fill up time on the death 
watch — but what to say? Student: “Why would God make His people suffer such great 
deals?” In this colorful escapade, A is for Apple, B is for black hole. One to ten billion in one 
fell swoop. These socio-lexical sparklers, these sounds and codes pulse in saturated rhythmic 
segments. Makes a lot of sense. Let’s rank the rambles. And together we woke, readjusted 
warmly, and fell back asleep. It didn’t seem a stroke of luck at the time — just, like, normal. 
Surf-intense danger; buried clots on the mud flats. Alternative life: social geographer. Hobby: 
fencing. “Are you keeping up with yourself, or not?”
 
Jade is extremely refractory by its nature. K. missed his mother, why he wore ambiguous 
clothing and his hair long like a girl’s. People kept saying “she” about him. And there was a 
time when L. had cropped hair, chose boys’ clothing, and got harassed in ladies rooms 
whenever she went to pee. Call the question. I want to bleed this over the margins of every 
single page.
 
Ribbons — Green White Violet — Give Women Votes. Makes a kind of sense. I feel I’ve barely 
lived my real life. Once the word “feminist” surfaced, all hell broke loose in the comment 
stream. The eye zoomed up from underneath as if a lens were buried underground. Men in 
work clothes and in suits threw women. Picked them up, threw them, throwing hard with the 
intent to break them. Terrible sleep, my heart then racing. Mushy day, with a dank chill under 
the surface. Ze — another entrant into the pronoun problem. Hir as a solution for the 
possessive? May I pronoun myself — e.g., I, Tiresias, the King Self? We own or own up to 
what parts of social gender? Paid on a sliding scale. Then I thought that a number 12 might 
be coming, so ran that last half block and finally made it home. And one day in Bethlehem, I 
washed H.D.’s grave, cleaning off the lichen with my wet bandana. 
 
Chicken at 40,000 feet, 4 Perrier, 3 Tampex, 2 cabernet, and one movie where it’s a blonde 
and a bimbo decoding [irony].™ He had a student who thought “The Oven Bird” was about 
Thanksgiving. Makes a kind of sense. “A little doll is the solution.” To what? So women 
hold up half the sky — who cares? Fragmentation implies a theory of wholes. But possibly 
not. The pencil was invented the year after Shakespeare was born. Wherever did you read 
that? The secret to cooking turkey is to turn it off quite early, letting it sit for a long while in 
the warm oven. It’s beginning to feel like a serious snow. Those were imitation or decorative 
oghams, whose marks, according to experts, actually said nothing.
 
This work, she said, is a darting arrow. There is such fervent, obsessive interest in policing 
women and in punishing women. Why did these years happen the way they did? What are the 
relationships among different margins? The lawyer’s pen was printed “Helping people
 preserve their wealth” in small gold letters. “One best-selling book!” (what‘re you a writer 
for if you don’t want one?) “you’d make a lot of money — then you could do poetry, or 
whatever you want.” Alternatively, low production values. The glue showing. No set level. 
And the rips. De-story the book; destroy the page but in the gaps, two-homedness, 
Zweiheimigkeit. Mapped “in these labyrinths of terrible differences — the dilemmas of truths.” 
 
Mis-en-abyme-ishly,
she seizes the pages of discarded books
she weeding she shewing she feeling she seeing
pages of the scarred books in which
“the unspeakable words never cease their subversive action.” 
Though never quickly.
If not now, when?
“I hold my honey and I store my bread …”
There was an attic
& then a second door into a second attic.
The airports of the living face the airports of the dead.
To run before walking — that’s what she wanted.

The ordained woman remarked categorically: “St. Paul didn’t write that!” But as it’s 
canonical, now what? The generic matchbook on the sidewalk was printed “THANKS.” 
Despite the delicacy of edelkayt, you must articulate your rascal side. T. is writing on one of 
those lost women artists. She told me who, but I forget her name. A man and a woman get 
into a taxi. I lost my nice cosmetic bag in that very taxi. Everything is a thread.
 
Ends up at 28.5 inches. This year’s Philly record, and the third overall. 4181 is the 19th Fibonacci number. It’s the whole nine yards. I’d suggest the word “human” or the word “person.” She wrote a section of her piano trio for toys. They changed the instruments mid-performance, and played toy violin, cello, and piano reflectively, like bits of girlhood thinly pinging. 2000 blackbirds baked in the sky. Is going beyond gender through gender enough? I make action plans. I plan my own loss.
 
Ze is the sibyl in her fetid bottle. The answer to the question is delusional: “I want to live 
again!” I learned today it’s older hens that lay those larger eggs. How about equality of 
questioning. Equality of straining. Of struggling. But then — it is not yet equal. So act as if? 
Then what?
 
The sounds a-blur confuse the statement. Hearing aids don’t clarify when many voices speak 
at once. The scherzo is scored as if the whole orchestra were tuning, scratching, randomly 
plucking. That’s a tough egg to follow! Another genre: epyllion. Not this one. Or is it? Full 
moon sex. Makes a lot of sense. Choose the phrase “female-bodied people.” After her lecture 
on women’s post-dictatorship civic status, a man stood up to ask “What about the penis?” 
 
That “best seller” woman didn’t credit that consciousness might follow from such operational 
choices. She was far too rich to think that! So much has happened. Quite suddenly. A snake 
struck Lady-dog, and I cried “HELP” in the dream. Thus I woke, stunned by the sound of 
that desperate interior voice. Anyway, it’s time now. It’s really time.
 
III. Fire Surf
 
Thereupon gigantic figures, earth and clay, announced that I stood with my feet only half 
planted. But the surface of the earth was in motion. I thought I had constructed these images, 
but detritus and its muddy tide had, in fact, made me. With its oil-gritty crescent strips and 
nipple-puckered seed buttons, the eucalyptus is a mightily combustible tree. I saw rogue 
energy; I saw piles of smashed debris; I saw the ribbon-braided holding place for river, but in 
this season being weedy furrowed dust in a wide, flat gully.
I was wood and could be burned.
“We have our marching orders. We will be playing the killed civilians.”
For a while, half sleep, it seemed much better, but given insomniac anxiety, it was not in fact 
better.
Bright lights refracted back downward under the blue-black clouds into one of the world’s 
tiniest airports. The wheels made their dark ripping sound as the bottom opened. Still, I’m 
endlessly making up for lost time.
Shunt the folded twists up and down the synapse; there were questions, but it was simpler 
just pointing to that spot.
Plans — big. Follow-thru — compromised.
No blades, awls, large shampoos, or gels. Headquarters miscalculated. We must stick with it. 
So much has already been invested.
 
He responds to the downturn by more intense tactics of marketing. Photoshop satiety.
Brightness, seductive pouting, chiaroscuro — how to trigger someone’s desire.
Mortgage companies began to destabilize, then to fail. Real assets did not match their 
liabilities.
The ogham slice and one more notch on the tree-thick stone — 
is this a real one, or a fake?
Who knows how to read this language?
All the big firms, Morgan Stanley, Lehman, Bear Stearns, held artful arrangements of debts 
and slice-and-dice notes so intricately segmented that it was all finally untrackable.
The attack of the difficult spread sheet.
Whatever was guaranteeing solvency might have been the same thing over and over.
(Buzzer sound.)
(Ignore buzzer sound.)
All of them making big money, big plunder,
smash and grab, a pretty ugly ferment that foretold the rest,
and impossible to ignore (one would have thought).
                        What one would have thought got squandered.
            There was no lack of telling, and
the operable lexicon
            couldn’t turn away
                        but it couldn’t intervene either.
The houses were broken, the walls fell open.
This is, of course, a pyramid scheme, so the system began to collapse.
 
They were just rogue soldiers. They were just bad apples. There were unfortunate mis-
calculations. An official apology will be sent.
On this stela, the motif of the handshake with the dead.
Jade cannot be carved with metal tools.
S. is worn down with chemo.
And now she cannot speak. Only by hard mineral abrasive, worked into a paste.
That company’s name was Chimera Capital.
I saw the sign. I was there.
The stylized masculinity of the noir does make a certain sense. Mannered so beautifully 
under its scrim of attractive doubt, packing heat, it’s almost comedy.
In life, however, the firewall is discontinuous. It has already become rubble.
 
Therefore it is good
to have companions
 
even if those were few
and sometimes unavailable.
If only time had not passed

the way it did, dribbled in bits,
us slogging through, oddly
glad it’s over — but think of that.
 
It is good also
to feel compassion
inside the dream and out of it.
 
He just keeled over. It was beyond understanding.
There was an exchange of birds between the living and the dead. 
“As they exit, they strike an antique cymbal, which reverberates in unison
with the cello harmonic.”
All those incipits were historiated letters.
This poem has been given a lot of ink.
Prosody: modulations of the void.
I lost one lapis earring.
Singular sadness, far in excess of the object.
What the genre said.
 
The news was such that I learned the word for slaughter, massacre: la strage.
Fire use in hominids — a benchmark.
Sign at the diner take-out — “ham bagel.”  
“Effortlessly” they said, “she effortlessly transmutes the personal into the political.” Oh, 
please.
This will be a surgical strike. We have very accurate data where they are.
He etches the places you are not supposed to notice — storage units, airport scanners, rooms 
with no windows, shipping containers, concrete barriers.
In their place — all smoke, some luck, but barely, the only thing saving them, three-alarm fire, 
was a double brick wall.
Waking at 5, I saw a pink moon setting. Pouring over the numbers and letters of meaning, 
one forces the tiniest marks and nets to hold this splay. Inflame, inflamed, inflaming images.
 
The green hose snakes through the pocky grass, but with a crimp in it. Uncrimp it and get the 
backlogged water to pour out.
Turn one’s pockets inside out, push open the corners to find the dust, the grift, the grit and 
fuzz of lint we are.
It is frightening, this part of the world’s work — of a technical uselessness (so far as 
accounting goes). But the articulation of multiple complexities, the saturations of syntax 
within lexicons, the synapses’ unpredictable pulsation
become portal to a hard and puzzling insistence. 
 
              “The voices of the children,
                          singing in the dome above.”   
Alongside
              “anxious about the market of everything
                          About the sound of our voices in the cavernous dome”
 
Odic abyss and Odos — the pilgrimage. Take the whole as a spirit journey into the real.
My friends and I have come to stay / to visit in another life. This is a powerful place I am 
looking to live. Magnetic. Who is it that turns up! You!
 
This is a different kind of counting. Bring me my arrows of desire.
 
 
IV. By Water
 
Food is manipulated, water is manipulated, education is manipulated, ownership, land, 
resources, medicine, heavily manipulated. Prisons are a profitable service industry. This is a 
double-entry ledger. But you’ll have to gather, prune, and repack this array — the boat is 
leaving in twenty minutes! Grab what you need — do you know what that is? Throw it in the 
suitcase, stuff it into the plastic trash bag. We have to get on that boat. No, but maybe we 
don’t. Maybe we should stay. What ever shall we do? Hard to watch the dithering. The scrum 
at the dock. What do we need? It really is a pity. Call it the “whatever.” Whatever bits there 
were, folded and crumpled together. Consider this a cultural heritage. Dead yellow-bellied 
sapsucker on Pine. I used to be a “Sagittarius” and now am that other one, the new sign. It 
was (as they say now) a “mute point.” Just leave the water on the moon alone!
 
 
V. Thunderstorm Dawn
 
I woke to a thunderstorm dawn, a yellow-gray dim with thin rising and polka dots of pinkish 
petals driven off the bloomed, blown cherry.
It rained for twenty hours. No more drought for us. At least right now. 
Dream of much confusion with suitcases. Could wake to find the same. What a story board! 
There’s no particular “elsewhere.”
But this new social subject, neither individual nor collective — isn’t quite me, either. More 
pronouns needed? Just saying.
This cup was made by one of the Little Masters.
At South Square Market, when they mist the veggies, a small loudspeaker plays “Singin’ in 
the Rain.” 
All your hard work will soon be paid off.
“It’s plain American that talented cats and dogs could read.”
 
Making a list — but always missing an item. There was always something else. I couldn’t 
identify what, but one felt it there. Blurred. Uncanny.
Bony travelers
scrabble across the looped and wayward scroll,
decoding or suffering
overgrown paths and scrub oaks,
and hinging, half-hung, half-off broken doors.
They swing, riding a riffled book.

Who was the third one, and the fourth?
I needed to bring them into focus.
Was that a man or was that a woman?
Interesting to think.
 
Alternative life: cellist. Hobby: my vegetable plot.
It seems perfectly clear that we will not outlast the on-earth years of the dinosaurs. Though 
this was a longish time — is that consolation? or not? Unthinkable?
The works and days, the sediments and glistening minerals, the fuzz and furze — it will make 
a thick and blasted palimpsest, yet perhaps only marginally readable. Who will decode it?
Every one of us so stuffed already, yet still trying to fill the void: religion, food, fat, glut, 
candy, shopping, stuff. Nothing is what I want. Well, just this.
 
Au lecteur de l’avenir! Salve! Here it is! I am decorating nothing. I am stating.
The dry stream down the rock side suddenly flowed to flood. An incredible storm. 
Afterwards, picked up the unripe tomatoes blown to the ground.
The storm discharged that pent-up electricity. We could all finally sleep. Not the same rain as 
yesterday, but a new dripping drupe shape, in droopy drops.
 
Cf. that second and third beside you, that third and fourth, wandering in cadence. A familiar 
cadence of familiar droning. Intensities of keening create humming.
Deiknumena: here are the many mysteries; these are the things shown.
Here they are!
 
When the ants ate the dead bat, they ate it all the way down, including the bones. There was 
no bat skeleton left. There was nothing but sated ants. Which is something after all.
The page, just printed, feels warm to the touch.
To make fried green tomatoes with the falls, use corn meal or polenta for the coating.
There were five military over-flights per day — fighter jets cracking over the top of the hill. 
That was right before the newest, freshest war.
 
“There was a brief break before the beating resumed,
 and my first impulse was to cover my ears, but then I thought,
‘If this man is crying, shouldn’t someone hear him?’"
 
 The mystical
            lettristic elaborations
of numbers couldn’t.
            A net made only of documents
            couldn’t. Nor, curiously,
could the mourners. The tasks:
           to listen, to identify & to respond.
Marvel to walk in language within being.
            Even cloaked by desperation and by rage.
I can no longer resist
what this is
and what it has become
 
in all elaboration
and beyond-itself complexity.
Let it begin again,
begin against again.
 
An early poem was called “The War Years.” And it is still. 
My right eye’s blurry, filled with something thin, irritating, and folded. 
It is a translation without an original.
“They baffle me, too. That’s all I’m painting for.”
 
Now’s the time when people post their news upon a wall. 
Choose talismans to hang above their desks.
Citations. Aphorisms. Gifts of the ever-receding angel.
Museum postcard of a glistening lemon. “Voyage autour de mes cartes postales.”
They look. We look. At it. The full array.
Of metamorphosis, tolerance, curiosity, attentiveness; of humility, conjunctures and 
juxtapositions. Of clashes and debates. Of pain.
Write messages, press send.
The journey did not end. I arrived almost nowhere and knew almost nothing. But still it did 
not end. So that — 
“I would like to be able to write a book that is only an Incipit, that maintains for its whole 
duration the potentiality of the beginning, the expectation still not focused on an object.”
 
Aura. Aurora. Prototype, all being preamble to the first figure,
like a documentary, only different.
Selva oscura meet obscure self,
wandering among itchy plants and between brambles,
a confrontation
with the fact of a question.
To follow there, “discovering new ways of folding.”
But never, luckily, enough.
 
So that my nudity
and the rumbles of language
in my curly gut morph into
magnetism and polyphonic eros.
And thus or thereupon
one recent summer day,
I found a long pubic hair
growing twisted and wiry 
right from my listing ear.
 
Hum hum humn, hymn and bong,
detritus and vertigo in sentences and lines,
you ethical ecology of vectors: you’ve stunned
me yet again with that incandescent
mix of arousal, illogic and grief I call my time.
And coming to this endless wall of volatility
that thing becomes a name.
 
Begin with any letter. Swallow and disgorge.
“this rrrr     to be a river”
“rien    n’aura eu lieu    que le lieu”
“She carries a book
of the unwritten volume”
that fills and empties pulse and surge.
 
Singing the exergue
nmnmnm — going backwards
half-hazardly mn und nm & utterals from
the knotted self, suffused with such a
dirty, yearning light, with such
ungainly lifht, with such 
clustering reverberation,
it underscored the toll.
 
“Wer, wenn ich schriee, hörte mich denn.…”
 “We have constructed ruins
to be reborn out of.”

Certain animals whose names I don’t know came to eat once from
             my hand.
 
They were of bronze or maybe some alloy in stages that without my
              understanding it
              ended up as
              flesh.
 
 In any case they were hungry the smell of food drove them crazy though
              the fruits were 
              onyx the liquids
              all rust.

 They scratched me I understand from frustration at their hunger; I
              slammed the 
              gate shut with a  
              thud that sounded
              like the metallic 
              echo of the oldest
              instruments a
              triangle or vihuela
              could imagine.
 
 I gave up since it also concerned my nasal voice of all the wiseguys in
              the neighborhood
              also a kind of
              food they call
              thingamies in the
              country with it
              they name loggerhead
              turtles or if they
              have to feed their
              horses they say
              corn stalks.
 
 These are words from which those animals ate that time they crossed
              the threshold and
              settled down right
              there in the garden.
 
 I can describe the garden as clasps of dyer’s rocket that buzz at the
              moment of greatest
             immobility subject to
              four opposing
              winds round some
              calyx.
 
 Then they leave then the sound of the gates closing the large doors of
              two barns on the
              district’s outskirts
              click shut you 
              hear the exact
              instant of the
              vertical flute when
              it commands.
 
 Everything stops, Orpheus the females the clay in the pottery’s very
              shape: the animals of
              only one existence, draw
              back.
 
 Only then do I hear that a window has just opened do I recognize for
              certain the voice that
              from the side calls
              me almost as if
              it will call my name
              that holds the
              name cast in
              bronze of several
              very ordinary animals
              that have disappeared. 
 
 I turn round since I think I’ve been standing all this time, I
              feel hungry.
 
 My wife who has blonde hair done in a spiral whose gathered
              strands are a
              flounce cast in
              yellow, is
              naked: opposite
              her with every-
              thing placed on
              the table with
              praiseworthy
              precision I see
              myself with the
              dark blue woollen 
              sweater under
              which I’m wearing
              a sienna polka-dot
              tie a double knot
              that looks like I
              don’t know whether
              the heart of the
              orchards or what
              lies below the city
              another city Ich

              doubtless of
              recently-rained-down
              slates.
 
Ecos
Ciertos animales cuyos nombres desconozco vinieron 
              a comer una vez de mi 
              mano.
 
 Eran de bronce o tal vez una aleación en etapas que  
              sin yo comprenderlo 
              terminaron en la 
              carne.
 
 En todo caso estaban hambrientos el olor de la comida 
              los desesperaba aunque 
              las frutas eran de ónix 
              los líquidos herrumbrosos.
 
 Me rasguñaron comprendo que de contrariedad en el 
              hambre: cerré la verja de 
              un golpe que sonó al eco 
              metálico de los mayores 
              instrumentos que puedan 
              concebir el triángulo o la 
              vihuela.
 
 Desistí pues también se trataba de mi voz gangosa 
              de todos los acoy del 
              vecindario también 
              de una cosa de 
              alimentación que 
              llaman féferes en el 
              país con ello nombran 
              a la caguama o por si 
              tienen que dar de comer 
              a sus caballerías dicen 
              maloja. 
 
 Son palabras de las que aquellos animales comieron 
              aquella vez traspasado 
              el umbral situados 
              de lleno en el jardín.
 
 Puedo describir el jardín como broches gualda que 
              zumban en el instante  
              de mayor inmovilidad 
              sometidos por cuatro 
              vientos contrarios 
              encima de algún cáliz.
 
 Luego se marchan luego se oyen cerrar los postigos 
              trancar los portones de 
              las dos trojes en las 
              afueras de la comarca 
              se oye el instante 
              preciso de la flauta 
              vertical cuando rige.
 
 Todo se detiene, Orfeo las hembras la arcilla en la 
              propia figura de la cerámica: 
              los animales de sólo una 
              existencia, retroceden.
 
 Sólo entonces oigo que se acaba de abrir una ventana 
              reconozco a ciencia 
              cierta la voz que de 
              perfil me llama casi 
              como si llamara mi 
              nombre que contiene 
              el nombre vaciado 
              en bronce de unos
             animales corrientes 
              que han desaparecido.
 
 Me doy la vuelta pues creo haber estado de pie todo 
             este tiempo, siento 
              hambre.
 
 Mi mujer que es rubia de pelo acaracolado cuyos 
              frunces son escarola 
              vaciada en amarillo, 
              está desnuda: frente 
              a ella con todo 
              dispuesto sobre 
              la mesa con precisión 
              digna de encomio 
              me atisbo con el 
              suéter de lana azul 
              prusia debajo del 
              que visto una corbata 
              siena de óvalos nudo 
              doble que asemeja 
              no sé si el cogollo 
              de las huertas o lo 
              que yace bajo la 
              ciudad otra ciudad 
              Ich möchte rauchen 
              sin duda de pizarras 
              recién llovidas debajo.
Peter Boyle has translated three poems from Cuban poet José Kozer’s 1988 collection Carece de causa (“No known cause” or “It lacks a cause”), which Boyle describes in his accompanying essay as a work that signals increased complexity, strangeness, and difficulty in the poet’s work. 
Translator’s essayEddy Street in Fort Scott runs north & south
The house I grew up in faces east, the back door to the west
 
As I write this in San Francisco I sit facing west to the ocean
The plains stretch between our backs
 
I sleep with my head to the south, and there, to the north
I went east from our house to go to grade school, and then high school, south & east
 
As here the work, if there is any, is east & north
You went by various right angles to get to
 
The freeways have reverted from the 19th century grid to the wandering path around obstacles
The main street here, Market, runs NE, SW
 
And in Fort Scott, Main Street, runs north and south
It is a ‘main street’ and a ‘city square’ town both —
 
the old square of the fort, the town grew up beyond, down Main Street —
as Market Street there runs NW, SE
 
(But ‘the square’ there, though, meant the triangle between Market, Wall & National, not the fort
Eyes in the back of the head tell me where I went there
 
It is an east-west axis —
as here they look north, the bare Marin headlands
 
But it is the angled turns that turn new vistas
On the plains you cannot even tell what you’ll hit, gone catty-corner off
 
Here    point to the unknown four corners of the state
And crossings, then? or what, simply, these roads and directions
 
carry?
.            .            .
 
 That car doesn’t leave the driveway but she’s in it.
— Chester Ashbery
with a destination or just destiny, inclining with wind
of what’s next up around bend or bridge above
river or creek or crick or tributary running to
Hudson or Red Hook, Catskill or Claverack,
Fish and Game Road where the hunting club holds parties

 
thirty years of autumn on the Parkway, spring on the Interstate,
summer on 66, black ice on Route 9,
to farm stand and farm store and way upstate, holy
old family farm and its orchardland, over and back to Lee,
to Lenox, to Tanglewood, to Amherst in smoky November,
 
 
and always again returning to the city
with stories as trophies or new trophies and their stories
tropes and true stories, news of whose atrocious restorations
changed a view we’d recognized for decades
music from QXR from AMC from MHT
 
 
and then from tape and then from compact disc
music becomes road and water, car wheels hydroplane
upon it, frictionless conversation of where should we
go now, what’s for dinner, what happened Saturday, where
should we go tomorrow, do you have the list
 
 
they love short sleeve cotton shirts and chinos they
wear the same size they’re both small town and city
they grew up near bodies of water they are magicians
and men of their word they read books and cards and
laugh at intertitles billboards roadsigns headlines ads
 
 
and at old radio, Bob and Ray, and whole plots of Great
Gildersleeves, plots of operas (Pelleas et Melisande), soap operas
(Twin Peaks), names of actors long forgotten by all except
one-time Whiz Kids, who won Oscars, who should have,
what’s the best movie in town, what’s at Upstate, what’s in Chatham
 
 
Johnny picks up on what Gene drops, Eugene picks up lines
from John, windshield an unmoving frame around
motion of landscape, commotion of traffic, emotional weather
or thunderstorms like standing right underneath Kaaterskill Falls
as spring thaw bursts down-mountain
 
 
somewhere a friend’s house was, somewhere an accident off
this exit just last weekend, somewhere we drove by last time and missed
the turn-off, or found the restaurant or roadside stand with hanging
pots or apples, the first of the berries or last of the
pumpkins at Love Farm or Mrs. Shortcake’s or Hotaling’s
 
 
and always another party where someone met someone,
do you remember? We met them Sunday, on Warren Street,
antiquing: they bought that chair. The lawnmower circles stonework
walls, cicadas sing to twilight, there are brown paper bags
from the Book Barn in the trunk of the blue Dodge Aries
 
 
box of fresh tomatoes on the floor in the old white Nova
records and papers from storage to storage, in back of the Odyssey
in the midnight Accord, a black walking-stick and
a small sack of Belgian chocolate; the silver Civic’s
passenger seat slung back at a generous angle
 
 
while a Piano Concerto in G Major enters a stretch of rapids.
“This isn’t the one-handed one Ravel wrote for Paul Wittgenstein,” says John;
at this point, in fact, it sounds like you might need three.
Then as phlox and syringa banks flash by, we are out on the lake.
“This is a nice part of this concerto.” Driving near Angel Hill
 
 
sharing experience, fresh intention, discoveries or
decisions, in momentum’s for-granted continuum,
won’t you come with us? There’s room for another, if
I’m in back: David or Joe, sometimes Trevor
and, once upon a time, Aladar, Jimmy, Pierre
 
 
and they’re off, to see patterns in Adams or Aunt Janet in
Elmira, to read in Toronto, snag kudos from Alma Mater,
inspect the new cartoon museum or gilded-age mansion just regilded,
for Le Misanthrope in the theater church in Stockbridge,
for friends reading poems at the Spencertown Academy, also a church
 
 
for Shakespeare at the Mount, or a Carter premier — he is just one hundred —
for Blue Stores, for Rhinebeck Fairgrounds, for Almar’s
meats, for Hawthorne Valley, for Otto’s in Germantown’s BLT at a
tablette by the window, for smoked goose from the Kingston market —
tonight’s sauerkraut casserole baked past eleven —
 
 
out on the island for Jane and Joe, for Larry’s tree lawn-sculptures,
dinner with Marc and Susan, Anne, to see new work by Darragh
way up Maine for Bob and Penelope, over to visit Michael,
through quiet New England woods to the antique house of a Deerfield classmate
in France for that Pompidou Centre to-do; why not Cabourg to see Balbec?
 
 
Like Helen, who always jumped first in the Buick when anyone was driving
they’re both “great goers,” they started to leave home early, they’re still going
they have gigs and tickets, appointments, invitations, news of wonders — of
hundreds of miniscule wonders of the western world, like children
to rescue from history by wandering, to bring riding
 
 
and both of them love to talk and they both love to listen
unbeholden, each beholds the other with such graceful
sheer irritationlessness, like a blue canoe on a green summer
river, as memory frozen in attitude drifts by like printed paper
and futures ripple outward in knowable, unknowable renewalThe space out of the river lands I saw
spread, go on to you
still now, I left before
they had gone there, I turned at Burley
along the river’s meadows out of sight of
the starch plants, I knew you lived
way past.
 
And look to now. This sight
in sight out a window at a snow
lighting on the yard and truck yard next door
goes on to you. What is any friend-
ship for
is given.
 
Worth or not worth it, hope
gives on this snow
somehow
falls to you
warmly.  Open o open
up our moments
 
The highways another summer go over
the inches unfrozen under the wet snowed ground
fallen on now —
Massachusetts slums muddy and snow on gone
to Kansas grasses
plait, winds home to
like pigeons
to Idaho
I know is there only
you are.
Lacking out of
wrapped in
land wrapped in this snow.

From The Next One Thousand Years, Selected Poems of Cid Corman, edited by Bob Arnold and Ce Rosenow (Longhouse, 2008)To Gerrit Lansing
There is a fire that burns in us
                          consumes us in equal flame.
To renew the flame, to cause each day
                          To burn with equal ambition.
That is our goal, that is our aim.
              To renew, to please, to stay
              These begot today.
This section of Jim Dunn and Kevin Gallagher's feature on poetry of Massachusetts, “Mass: Raw Poetry from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts," focuses on the influence of Gerrit Lansing.The Deer Hunters
Come, dear friend, we shall save something
for posterity. What is your opinion
of this gentleman urinating in the alley
that we have so many memories of?
I shall tell him that it is not nice
and you at the same time shall catch him
good. Just like that! Hold
on tight to the net and be careful, so that
he does not get his coat dirty (a fine garment
from the early sixties), and I
will be right back, after I get
a bigger stick pin.
 
 

 
 
 
Outside the Map 
Christ, darling, it always gives out
when we’re almost there. It always gives out
 
when pottery provides employment
to many of our rural folk, and starts to
 
bring in profits. It always gives out
when I pour water on a whale.
 
It always gives out when I ask:
“Isn’t there a gas station nearby?”
 
It always gives out when I say:
“We sure could use a gas station.”
 
It always gives out when I shout:
“Look out for a gas station!”
 
It always gives out when I request:
“If you see a gas station,
 
please tell me.” It always gives out
when I translate everything into English
 
or Japanese. It always it gives out
when we pass the house of a gynecologist
 
where at least three patients
are sitting, and each driver
 
of the cars at the front of the gate
wonders about his own full tank,
 
without which there’s less of everything,
without which nothing goes (and the map
 
won’t give out). It always gives out
when you need to write on both sides
 
(because you need to write on both sides
and the map gives out on you.) It always
 
could have given out sooner.
 

 
 
 
Birch Wood 
In our building
one guy
leaves for
work at five
a.m. He ought to
move out
the sooner the better.
Ideally at four
thirty,
 
son. The bombs
Hitler dropped didn’t
catch the milkman.
He went out as usual
on the streets of London
in his slightly wrinkled
milkman’s uniform.
Milkmen
are among us.
 
Hitler’s bombs
did catch
the bottles
that had hoped
to welcome the milkman
in the early morning
The early morning
went out to fuck
with Hitler’s bombs.
 
I saw the milkman
in a photo
in National Geographic.
He was the only milkman
I looked at closely.
His cart 
full of bottles
is my cart
full of bottles.
 
I can’t say
to myself “Son,”
and this complicates
matters a little, if maybe
I wanted to play the father.
Son, now I
am talking to Mama,
who sent me to the cellar
for wine, where there
 
is no television.
Space Heater,
which I subscribed to
in April
has not yet arrived.
It should have come
in November.
“Cozy poems,
cozy stories,
 
hot reviews.”
Very early
this year I paid
for the subscription
to Sestina.
They were to publish
three of my pieces,
the ones about the army.
It’s likely they published
 
one. It’s likely
the lady
who delivers the letters
knows it by heart.
Her husband
was a sergeant.
Crushed by a tank.
The lady delivers letters
because she cannot
 
sit still. The bicycle
her husband left her.
She won’t talk
with strangers
about the chain.
She doesn’t need lights:
her brother-in-law
picks her up on his way
to the station. She gets a discount
 
on everything,
even on Transportation,
which she’s been reading since May.
Since May she’s also been
looking through Cherished Italics,
Friday’s Haiku,
Baroque with Us,
and Elegy for the Partisans.
 
I write: “Dear Madam,
I dedicate the sestina
to the memory of your husband,
who was a sergeant
who was crushed
by a tank (although
the sestina concerns
lighter arms
and victory).
 
At the same time I ask
for the return of Space Heater.
Please hold on to
the other magazines.
I also wish
to inform you
that yesterday I paid for
a subscription to
The Worm of Rhyme,
 
which should be
to your taste.”
I put the envelope
into a copy of Orcio
the Brave,
which she probably
hasn’t heard of yet,
because I picked it up
Friday at the printers.
 
I concentrated
on the dustiest
bottles
to honor the milkman
from London,
who I mentioned
before. Is he sleeping?
He sleeps when he smells milk.
I missed
 
the scene in which
Bolesław torments
Ola, excuse me,
Daniel Olbrychski,
abuses Elżbieta 
Żołek. To judge
from the expression
on your face, they
haven’t yet cut
that scene. “Uncut.”
 
The guy from the building
across the way promised
that if he does not receive
the latest issue of
Polish Sander,
he will take out a stun gun
from his sofa bed and he will leave
it on all night.
 
We plan to organize
for our hospital patients
a beach vacation.
Polish Mail will foot the bill.
We’ll deliver them
by bus. The national bus
company will chip in. That’s why
I asked you to leave
the curtains alone.
 

 
 
 
 
Elaborate Train 
I have stripped her of gray postmodernism
and lacey O’Haraism.
My right hand rested on her left classicist,
my left fell upon the barbarian on the right.
Our ideas for an anthology matched
one hundred percent. We climaxed
at ninety thousand words.
 
The co-owner of the apartment, the crazy aunts
Polish Television and Gazeta Wyborcza,
went to the movies to see Independence Day 
or something of the sort
and came back on foot
because some student
had slashed every kind of diction.
 
We moved the dresser of tomorrow and hope
near the door, so as to scan the author’s portraits in peace.
The aunts stood on the sidewalk under the window
and nagged. We replied: “Copy yourself, both of you!”
The hard drive crashed in the wee hours.
We had everything on floppies,
 so with one last burst of energy we designed the cover.
 

 
 


 
Why I Am Not a Gravedigger 
I am not a gravedigger, I am a woodworker.
Why? Maybe I would rather be
a gravedigger, but I am a woodworker. I work
 
with gravediggers. I meet one:
he starts to dig. I look closely at this shovel.
“Sit down and have a drink,” he says. I sit
and drink. We both drink. I regard
the shovel. “There’s a clump of clay on it.”
“I knew something was too heavy.”
“Aha.” I walk away and days pass
and I come back again. The digging
goes on, and I sink too, and days
likewise. I come back again. The grave is
dug. “But where did the clay
go?” There is only
the shovel. “I buried it,” he says.
 
And me? One day I think of
a coffin made of oak. I cut
boards. Soon I have a whole
stack of boards, not planed.
Then a second stack. I could use
a plane, not the one I have, but
a sharp one that could bring out the wood’s
color and life. Days pass. It is even
a piece of furniture, I am a real woodworker. I cut
but I haven’t yet mentioned
nailing it together. There are twelve coffins,
I put them in a van. And one day
I see near the cemetery a van full of shovels.

The Reading Room in Christianshavn
“Tulips originated in Turkey,”
an intrusive old man lectures his
sleeping neighbor. “In the Netherlands
around the year 1560 …” But no one
pays him any attention!
The previous day the Danish
successor visited Aalborg
where he and city residents dined
on roasted lamb entrails.
 

 
 
 
A Conspiracy
He caught up with him and with a string impeded his ability to breathe.
Squeezed as tight as he could.
But it still wasn’t enough.
He also carved out a few holes, to look at the blood up close.
It was a cruel act.
(A topic of conversations at soirees and parties.)
A psychopath, a pervert, a vampire, a truly unpredictable
human being.
Ms. Gunilla says these are typical complexes from the kindergarten.
Mr. Per, however, blames his twisted nature.
In any case, what an unpleasant matter.
If I tell someone, they’ll cut off my head.

Light in the Cathedral
What took place a moment ago
no longer has any importance.
 
Stop thinking about the silverware,
We’ll give it to the Salvation Army.
 
Dazzled, you whisper Light …
and I follow you in silence,
 
wondering what will happen to us
when you see the sun again.
 
Poem
The box on the table has begun to think.
Thinking beyond me.
Or is it just my imagination?
Of course not. It is. Meditating behind my back.
 
I don’t see it. How do I know it is thinking?
This thought has just occurred to me.
The thought that a wooden cube
has begun to think.
 
I turn around.
Tap my finger against the plywood.
Look inside.
 
I can see one hollow thought.
 

 
 
 
Reading Homer
to Stanisław Vicenz
Another stilt, another verse
to prop the rest. The sky is sour, full
of lingering snow. Beyond that hill
we find some washed up afternoon red,
but that’s it. The words tilt in our direction
and the signal arrives, the road is cleared: we set off from a venerable
German village to a city of memories,
passing by the undeveloped pictures of the past.
 
How come, Odysseus? All you needed to do was reach
Ithaca. No sentimental excursions,
metered sentences, wondrous pictures
scattered like poppy seed from an open hand.
Your task was to return and settle down. And here you are — entering gardens
like swift digressions, seducing girls and birds,
traversing in stately gait the ungainly whole.
 

 
 


 
Parched Throat
Can’t speak. The last rainless droplet.
Dust blocks the passage of thoughts,
And they get mired at midpoints; soon they’ll be stuck for good.
Gravel. Pebbles. Each crack filled to the brim.
A veritable congestion. Like there are no words.
You say something and you hear a river flee to its dry spring,
An orchard coming down to light close to the earth and deeper, into grainy dusk
Beneath your fingers. Life got stuck inside and stays there, baked in.
It would rather speak; instead it makes parched circles.
 

 
 


 
Breath
Why I keep silent is a question
it makes no sense to answer the trees
crowd the horizon in rows only the song
remains the song is a confession
band over band of yellow sky
at evening when platforms
depopulate the case is closed just please
no more questions the boat finally
at rest at some age
one no longer waits for wind one waits for a deeper
breath that’s why I keep silent why I am silent now
 
There are orioles
in the woods, and in
metric poetry
the only measure
is the length of vowels.
 
But only once a year
is quantity poured
into nature, as in the
meter of Homer.
 
That day yawns
like a caesura:
from morning on
there is a peace, and
arduous prolixities.
 
The oxen are pas-
turing, and there is
a golden laziness
to even take
from the reeds
the richness
of a whole note.

Sleeplessness. Homer. Taut sails.
I have counted the list of ships
halfway: that long-stretched flock, that
flight of cranes that once rose up
over Hellas.
 
As if a wedge of cranes on off to far-off lands —
on the heads of emperors the froth of gods —
where do you sail? If there were not Helen,
what would only Troy be to you, o Achaean husbands?
 
The sea, and Homer — all is moved by love.
To which should I listen then? And now Homer is silent,
and the black sea, declaiming, roars,
and with it heavy thunder nears the pillow of my bed.

Hagia Sophia 
 
Hagia Sophia — God has ordained that
nations and kings should stop here!
Your dome, in one eye-witness’ words,
hangs from heaven, as if on chains.
 
And to all the ages is Justinian’s example —
when the Ephesus Diana let him abduct
one hundred-seven columns of green marble
for alien gods.
 
But, exalted in his soul and thought,
what was in your lavish boulder’s thoughts
when he laid out the apses and exedrae
pointing them to the east and west?
 
The temple is beautiful, and bathed in peace;
the forty windows are a festival of light;
on pendentives underneath the dome, the four
archangels are more beautiful than anything.
 
And the wise spherical building
will outlive nations and centuries —
and the resonant sobbing of seraphim
will not warp the dark and golden surfaces.

At a fearful height, a wandering light —
but does a star so twinkle?
O transparent star, o wandering light,
your brother, Petropolis, is dying.
 
At a fearful height, earth’s dreams burn,
a green star twinkles —
O if you’re a star — the water and heaven’s brother,
your brother, Petropolis, is dying.
 
A monstrous ship at fearful height
speeds on, spreading its wings —
o green star, in beautiful abject poverty
your brother, Petropolis, is dying.
 
Above the black Neva transparent spring
is shattered, the wax of immortality melts —
O if you’re a star — Petropolis, your city,
your brother, Petropolis, is dying.

The Insignificant
     — “What is more pleasant than the blue sky, unless it’s a cloud, submissive in the sunlight?
     “That is why I prefer a commonplace idea to silence, and, even more than a white page, some writing considered insignificant.
     “This is my only exercise, and my hygienic sigh.”
 
The Candle 
     Sometimes night revives a singular plant whose gleam breaks up rooms and their furniture into solid masses of shadow.
     Its leaf of gold clings impassively to the hollow of a little alabaster column by means of a very black stem.
     Seedy moths attack it in preference to the too-high moon, which is vaporizing the woods. But, instantly singed or worn out by the struggle, they lie trembling, on the verge of a madness that is close to stupor.
     Meanwhile the candle encourages the reader with the flickering light it throws on his book at each sudden release of an unusual smoke — and then bends over its plate to drown itself in its food.

I am lost in the face

girl I have never seen before,
the photograph taken —
 
into the wall, or where the eyes
look upward ecstatic
on out of the picture, and the dark corner
settles, is loved in, hands
 
out of the picture touch,
and the body gives to.  Where in the darkness
of the corner across the way in this room
her face bends, looks up, smiles, the skin
 
rough
and to be loved.
Where, and what

The heat of spring has driven me into my hands for coolness,
looking deep past the finger lines at ice beneath the skin,
           as if I could not even stand the fever of the days
auguring love for anyone beneath the lilacs.
Why can’t I camp my speech into all sorts of forest fires,
why is it ice on the lakes I want to give to anyone of understanding?
The why why why out of the carved figures
           put up unnoticed at the back porch long ago,
all the unconscious decisions toward the reason of exactitude,
the great fertility of intelligence, looking for the secrecy of maturity
in vaults of knowledge —
                                             and now I count gravel in the driveway
looking for a smidgen of emotion, laughter for feelings,
the live and not the dead.
                                                  And yet I know just as well
there is no blood here, even to cut myself —
laddering cold water, that’s all, here in the shadow
of those damned figures.
                                                The rotten backyard will not serve up
any brimming sky — and still I sit on the back steps
gathering up what axe handles there are …
to add heft to decay, but it’s no good, no good.
I know I lived on bright hills once, I tell it
constantly, I wish the world in sunblind colors again,
           I hate intelligence sitting on the floor telling
seriousness for the party, from sterility, from this gin and tonic …
and I have only stomped down the July hills to this corner,
long footsteps into utter sickness till now
I want to vomit the whole mind away.
           Regret regret regret up and down
the driveway, wanting blind ignorance
to flow out from between the marigolds, to see only
the tomato plants I played in fifteen years ago ….
I understand things too well.
           This hot spring offers me the warmth
of all existence, but I cannot feel at all.
           I know the sweating loves beneath the trees
like logic, logic lying in my cold tin pans.

 the keys to yonder have been dropped off in
 the midst of space covered over by a greasy 
 hair, or by a kickback of laundered dough,
 or by a slurp of excreted mucus — 
 covered by everything that requires a special key,
 granting hope to thy neighbor with the promise
 of closeness, they bring him to the place where, cut the
 crap: there’s no mercy here
 
 
2
 the keys to yonder have been jammed in there
 the passage is plugged, giving the floor to a gangsta’s
 dull moan, to the indecent giggle
 of a schoolgirl, squatting with a nasty smirk
 in the entrance hall, to a hoarse cough
 tearing the trochea apart, to the smack of oatmeal
 into an unwashed bowl, to one more missed cycle,
 cause of agony, got to go knock one back
 
 
3
 the keys to yonder won’t do the trick
 today blasphemy is always banality
 sick head twisted sideways
 all-inclusive services all the way 
 up to anal, and having been skinned, 
 crying, flayed in a slaughterhouse, and can’t 
 call her either bitch or sweet-pea, the best morsels
 left on the plate, takes a smoke, voguishly
 
 
4
 the keys to yonder shake in the hand
 of the average joe who didn’t make the grade,
 the crater has long been silent, but the volcano
 has not gone out, get together trails off in 
 careless screw, the slacker hormone 
 gave voice, the trashed efficiency dwelling
 stinks of no hope, that shout wasn’t:
 watch out; it was: give it to them in the mug
 
 
5
 the keys to yonder can take the place of an axe
 or an opener, the three-day drunk 
 was broken up by EMTs, the grinding 
 ignition in that wreck melted 
 a snow smear, cut-rate cogñac
 heats up the insides, producing
 a stale, enclosed reek, cut the
 squirming, as they say, clean and sober
 
 
6
 the keys to yonder must be cast 
 into the dye, to become disgustingly
 variegated, their owner’s on good terms with 
 a neighbor lady’s pussy, compares 
 statures with a patriotic-minded 
 pensioner, used to kneading the breast
 from sudden pain in the ribcage, breaking in
 the boots, wiping grease on
 
 
7
 the keys to yonder need no hanging
 or mortise lock, no problemo
 slow grind called on the dance floor, ecsing out
 squeezes his mama’s handles, pus
 dribbles out of the inflamed inner, the ankle trip
 tumbles the guy hurrying to defend
 his convictions, could be worse, so the baby
 grand’s mouldering, the larvae bothersome to this day

8
 the lease on the keys to yonder
 is expiring, beer with bar-snack pistachios
 tastes cut with something, in the fuzzy bathrobe
 looks more miniature-like, pimple pokes through
 the cover-up, on the clothing every 
 gill bulges, it’s like junior high here 
 thanks to the shareholders discovering 
 the developer’s fraud, nasty stare glazes over
 
 
9
 usually the keys to yonder come 
 in only one copy, they rarely cut 
 duplicates by machine-tool equipped with 
 software support for heightened precision, and then
 the benchmark becomes the stink of
 success, of semblance to an exchange
 about Gasprom, that swiped up the media  
 magnate’s empire, gave the go-ahead just in time
 
 
10
 none can deprive the keys to yonder
 of power, even a dude past all limits 
 walks on eggshells before them, disinfects 
 with hydroxide on cotton swab, tile was laid
 in the half-bath, the showdown 
 among investors resulted in 
 a merger, late frosts brace the weekender’s
 spirits, hassles due to arrears
 
 
11
 the keys to yonder get inspected are they 
 the real deal, checked with a tooth, slaves away 24/7
 like Pinocchio’s papa, the water tower
 renovated into a sweet club, wildman 
 exterior still no reason to get
 out of bounds, boozed up graduate can’t
 keep hands to himself, fashionista’s freckled
 chin swings, chewing something, gotta get used to it
 
 
12
 the keys to yonder practically don’t exist
 yonder don’t open, the keyhole
 hasn’t been cut, after days
 spent in this horizonlessness you might just
 shit yourself, a chum drives totally nuts
 with that manaiacal seriousness
 while choosing beer, sorta dowdy but going
 places, used to hookups with silly broads
 
 
13
 the keys to yonder are like spit, apparently meant 
 for the well, but hooting off into nowhere
 our dear little friend, searching out the WC
 bumbles into the storage, more melons sold
 than usual, the info brought by the little birdie
 don’t warm the heart, the news is so SFW
 excesses stack up, looks like an axe-murderer
 more or less a softie, a bug infestation
 
 
14
 whoever was sent for the keys to yonder
 is in no hurry, knows that time runs slowly
 ahead, there are missing entries 
 in the price-list, better to remain 
 unnoticed until the next
 inspection, there’s not much use from
 foundering branches of industry, rusty blade
 runner in place, the innards are out
 
 
 
Ключи от края
 
 1
 ключи от края обронены на
 пространство посередине, покрытое лохматой
 волосиной, иль слитого грина
 откатом, или выделенной смазки
 хлюпаньем, всем, к чему нужен ключ
 особенный, обнадежив близкого обещаньем
 близости, его подводят туда, где плюнь
 и разотри, тут не до пощады
 
 
2 
 ключи от края вставлены до упора 
 язычок отодвинут, слово теперь тупому
 мычанью бандоса, нескромному хихику
 школьницы, в парадняке с ехидной
 миной севшей по-маленькому, глухому кашлю
 разрывающему трахею, плюханью каши
 в недомытую миску, очередной задержке
 вызывающей терзания, треснуть где бы
 
 
3
 ключи от края не проканают
 кощунство сегодня всегда банальность
 скособочена голова больная
 в услуги все включено до анала
 вплоть, плачет по снятой шкуре
 освежеванный на живодерне, паскудой
 не назовешь, также милашкой, вкусно
 оставленное на тарелке, манерно курит
 
 
4
 ключи от края дрожат в руке
 середнячка, не встроенного в обойму
 кратер давно молчит, но вулкан 
 не потух, нечаянно оттрахал
 при встрече, разыгрался гормон
 раздолбайский, убитая распашонка
 смердит безнадегой, не караул
 выкрикнуто, а в репу врежь им
 
 
5
 заменяют ключи от края топор
 и открывалку, тяжкий запой
 прерван амбулаторно, жигуль
 заводясь, оставляет в снегу
 проталину, ординарный коньяк 
 разогревает внутренности, обонять
 заставляя в них спертое, харэ
 говорят тебе ершиться, умн и трезв
 
 
6
 ключи от края в краситель кинуть
 положено, чтобы стали противно
 пестрыми, владелец их дружит с киской
 жительницы микрорайона, ростишком
 меряется с мыслящим патриотично
 пенсионером, привык соски мять
 от внезапной боли в грудине, ботинки
 разнашивает, наносит мазки на
 
 
7
 ключам от края замок навесной
 или врезной не нужен, к чему проблемы
 в клубе медляк объявлен, весь на таблетках
 обнимает партнершу за талию, гной
 вытекает из воспаленного, подсечка
 валит слишком спешащего отстоять
 свои убеждения, еще полбеды, что рояль
 трухляв, досаждают личинки по сей день 
 
 
8
 ключей от края срок эксплуатации
 истекает, пиво в прикуску с фисташками
 отдает разбодяжкой, в халате мягоньком
 смотрится миниатюрнее, подрумяненный
 прыщик топорщится, на одежде все
 шхеры оттопырены, просто детский сад
 устроили пайщики, обман раскрыв
 застройщика, соловеет взгляд масляный
 
 
9
 ключи от края обычно в одном
 экземпляре даются, редко их дубликаты
 изготовляются на станке с программным
 обеспечением повышенной точности, и тогда
 этаблированной ценностью становится вонь
 успешности, похожести на разговор
 о Газпроме, схапавшем у медиа-магната
 его империю, вовремя дали отмашку
 
 
10
 у ключей от края власть не отымет
 никто, и законченный беспредельщик
 перед ними на цырлах, ватою с нашатырным
 спиртом обеззараживает, в раздельном
 санузле положили плитку, разборка
 между инвесторами послужила слиянью
 предприятий, вселяют в дачника бодрость 
 поздние заморозки, из-за недоимок дрязги
 
 
11
 ключи от края проверяют на подлинность
 берут на зубок, внеурочно вкалывает
 как папа карло, башня водонапорная
 перестроена в клубешник, дикарская
 внешность еще не повод разнузданно 
 себя вести, распускает руки подвыпивший
 выпускник, у фифы подбородок веснушчатый
 ходит, что-то жуя, придется свыкнуться
 
 
12
 ключей от края фактически нет
 край не отворяется, замочная
 скважина в нем не врезана, после дней
 проведенных в бескрайности можно ведь
 усраться, кореш здорово загрузил
 своей маниакальной серьезностью
 при выборе пива, вроде бы неказист
 а пробивной, привык путаться с дурехами
 
 
13
 ключи от края будто плевок в колодец
 вроде прицельный, а ухает в никуды
 друг дражайший, разыскивая ватер-клозет
 тыркается в подсобку, продано дынь
 больше обычного, не греет известье
 узнанное от верблюда, новость по кочану
 излишки копятся, похожий на изувера
 достаточно мягкотел, налетела гнусь 
 
 
14
 за ключами от края отправленный 
 не торопится, знает, что время медленно
 бежит впереди, значатся в прайс-листе
 отсутствующие позиции, незамеченным
 выгодно оставаться до следующей
 проверки, от загибающейся отраслиRien ne me rend plus heureux que de sortir dans la campagne et de peindre ce que je vois.
— Henri Rousseau
Aglitter in the dromedary dawn 
 with cold rubles, the old cyclone 
 boasts come what come may, sir. 
 Like a silly curlicue, for instance, 
 that you called August. It too had 
 a way, prescient and plunderable, 
 a mix of corsage and assemblage, 
 or coconut if you can imagine it.
A wax cylinder in the wind was 
 carrying us chevalierly through 
 the alphabets of petite longings, 
 our gumption of restless itching. 
 If we stop here it’s because here 
 it’s thick dusk. Streaming ribbons 
 from the sun, yellow fields of sky 
 matriculating without thinking.
Slowly, the aperture goes bronze 
 squinting in the marble harbor, 
 guffawing, crocheting a speech. 
 The morning buildings are air 
 sugared with stiff upper lip. 
 Clipped romance butters our 
 pockets with comic-book accents, 
 pocked lingo and perfumed lint.
Yesterday, the dazzlement washed us 
 away like laundry boats bedraggled
      toward a ventilated hexagon of sea, 
 its coils and plungers, its plumber’s tape
      amid lulling processions of joggers.
     One spring patio is for rodeos 
 niggled with iodine figures, weaved
      tapestries inside bat tulieries. 
 But that reminds me, how exactly 
      do words form brittle histories —
     rummaging a basement heap, a guttural 
 section, suppose, or an anatomical plane,
      a slice of what should be and has been said 
 but wasn’t, like some yogurty radio static
      giving way assuredly to sweet hosannas.
     We bench-press archways with our eyes 
 recalling a time when we actually had eyes. 
 Yes, that was eons ago, gazing inside at TV
      bunkers as Shock-&-Awe hunkered down
     for supper, a roseate ghostly assembly line 
 producing but bruise. I could use a good one c
 ome to think of it. And nickeled-and-dimed,
      halter-top waters rise. Ferries a-glint with
     restaurant dementias. Some happenstance 
 meant to be talked about. We’ll have to let be, 
 with addled doo-wop and haughty pince-nez.
      Alone here in the river walk you buoy it all.
You, walking stick, are emptier in a crowd, 
                though not as empty as one.
 Amateur, I’m watching your surveys shrug 
                to the ground, dear and ruthless. The
fiesta has begun. And waffling in the breeze, 
                this is the time to reprogram
 an ideogram or two, flinging pants off 
                for stoic sleepiness.
Dreams have the following architecture: 
                metallic substance, pursuant laws
 of mineralness. Vague plunder of booty, 
                plastic robe of pearls. Sesame
pirates of our wonderfully dull childhood 
                where a perverted man
 usurps your surname and wanders the lawn, 
                sprinkling reindeer tears.
Just as to love is to doze, so what I crave 
                is to nose about. I, however,
 in 17th-century fashion, stare at your chaps 
                of frolicking gold, apparel
that includes a spigot, which cargoes some 
                mumbling grudge in its hull
 quarters to Tribeca. There we can arrange 
                a spotted coordinate for the Star,
the strait pass that was kindred, mortal. Now 
                resume the pose. Walk, rub, walk.
It only takes a brochure in your palms to let me see 
      native Indias and corpulent Africas open gently 
 your cornet wrists, your marigold-clumped brow.
People should be able to account for something in 
      what they desire or they roam fore’er, secluded
 under western bandanas. This leads to reclusiveness.
Extreme passivity, puss ocher and the like. General 
      spiels of uneasiness. I should know, happening to be
 one myself, a curmudgeon crayfish like the Fantômas.
A board was laid out. It had your legs on it, suspended 
      scissor-like. A mode I knew from albums. Speaking
 of which, one bum was overheard saying to the other,
“I like your bum.” Quite moving mumbo-jumbo really. 
      One door slices us to the next, the tunnels funnel us
 into faraway space with pristine shops. You snicker to
friends across absolute distance. They always ask 
      me the fable of my life, the accurate one, replete
 with liquid bones to pick at or throw as testimony.
I prefer sassafras to crème brûlée on any given day. 
      Brutal and cunning, but unknown, I love cyclists.
 So a cloud curtailed me. And I awoke horizon.
The result 
 of such 
 expressiveness cannot 
 be denied. 
 Especially honey, 
 figures of 
 rain buttressing 
 cheeks with
small change — 
 contingencies due — 
 and this 
 mosaic: a 
 Giotto chapel 
 we’ll name 
 our stone-braced 
 embodiment. Neither
reconditioning nor 
 resurrection needed 
 to become 
 The Possible.
 You once 
 told me, 
 first giving 
 up. Give
up what? 
 A stripper 
 made in 
 toothy encaustic. 
 Boring. We 
 were literally 
 boring holes 
 in spy
stations. 
 Calling this all 
 a pipe-dream, 
 a.k.a. Yourself, 
 a something
 for our 
 lips, sandwiched 
 in stares
stuck in 
 Porta-johns. This 
 kind of 
 looking isn’t 
 seeing. This 
 kind of 
 consumption ’tis 
 blindness. An
igloo rug — 
 it’s not 
 enough to 
 be relative 
 to example 
 and talk 
 art for
 the dear
and near 
 to us, 
 picking up 
 the phone 
 one day 
 saying clearly 
 but only
                                  “And?”
I take refuge in each skittery movement and moment 
      I’m given when not forced to dwell on a monument.
 Iron’s the last bastion afforded to a materialist state. 
      Next to gentle gardens, for a bit, we argued. Polluted
scales were a kind of resolution to wrestle us from 
      ourselves, though I kept noticing the way our lips
 pinched themselves accidentally, the vanity roped 
      around its waist, delicate and burnt, as if dread
had come into the room with a waltz on our breath. 
      At such gestured pace, you induce a sigh. Yes, you
 ignorant child, those fireworks were yours. And this 
      time they were. Pyrotechnics fade. Experiments not
talked about until today in the skyrise of cabinets 
      and windows of papers flustered from sunlight
 rise like a Goth girl costumed in hardened beeswax 
 whose tattoo reads Buried on the Breath of Dawn.
 
Wonder needed, patois needed, monkey brains optional. 
 Suitors needed, comforters needed, lactose-tolerance optional.
 Spray-painted suits, undulating lanterns, scenes of frantic night
 all for a checkbook that I would seize before surrendering
my love of The Real. One who will be for the future, if only 
 to turn back his long and lioned head with remorse code.
 Acknowledging acknowledgements. Like a magnet we drifted 
 in a boy’s blink for years not knowing we were drifting.
It is always dusk here. Mechanical animals wait for us. 
 We wait for each other. Berry-eyed and bituminous, a tortoise 
 of waiting and wanting, mating and pray mantising. So 
 what are you really interested in, Pythagoras?
Things as they are, or judgments? Careful, the truth’s a pill, 
 so chew before swallowing. Maybe it’s just a tromp l’oeil 
 effect, on second thought. Even so, it is what it is, and 
 what it is, we must swallow. And we do. We do.The swallow is flying in a red dress.
The dress interrupts work to be done in the woods.

Frills in rows and layers are little speech acts.
The dress is doing all the talking.

What is little can become what is larger.
Big bloom and parlando.

Sooner or later frills can become direct appeals.
Not frivolous.

“Be my” is direct.
“Be my/be my baby” is no less direct.

It is an interruption.
Pleading please so won’t you please interruption.
 
 
There was woods and there was only woods in the beginning only canopy
and understory stories with the Indians in and out of the stories which became
different stories with the settlers who cut down the woods to make houses
and fields and to keep houses warm in long unrelentingly cold winter.

Leaving only tallest sycamores with massive camouflage colored trunks and
cream colored narrow tops not good for burning or for building who cut
down the woods to make houses and fields who cut down and through
the understory story to make a mill-race a wooden mill with a wooden wheel.
 

The mill abandoned the mill-race silted over and clogged where it joins
a creek or small river with many turnings the fields going to weeds
dewberry trumpet vine poisonous pokeweed goldenrod the woods returning
to woods cherry witchhazel hawthorn hackberry redbud hard and soft maples.

The creek or small river remaining with its many turnings remaining not
moving but flowing weeds cut down the fields plowed and disced and
disced again and dragged the woods re-cut and mowed to make a path with
its own turnings under the canopy remaining and through the understory.
 
Near the path which has no Indian name nor any other name but is
beckoning in its own turnings near the path are planted new trees and bushes
new maples with open palm-shaped or deeply divided or moon-shaped
leaves new viburnums fragrant in spring clustered bright berries in autumn.

What has been planted dogwoods and magnolias in addition spireas and
more spireas in addition must be well-tended in hot humid summer the path
well-tended in each season that those who visit the woods may walk
unhindered and if not finding peace or the lady hope may walk unhindered.
 
 
Pleading is powerful.
Knocks you off your horse and makes you cry.

Can happen.
Something else can happen after direct directions.

Sooner or later in layers after layers.
Hushed.

Can happen despite the clamor of angels.
This is despite clamor in mind.

Across a blue formation under a florid sky formation.
This is after all the talking.
It’s the call of the swallow.
The call hushes and is itself hushed.
Today I leave Cambridge, I mark out of these grey old boulders
left before even the glaciers
back to a center of beginnings, what world alone I knew
when I was young, what circle established everything
the times I let nothing end my silver, my gazes high
in the pincers ending school, ending someday —
                                                                                       it all moved toward
the stores, the town, then, whenever involvement would come,
but certainty, certainty, the hardwood floors I cherished
to replace my worn linoleum …
home, now, like sun setting behind my back
always on the edge of earth — burned, burned to death in Kansas summer
but it is open! sweet fence at my front yard
open, old black paint carved for me then,
needless to break down —
 
I stood out in the rain and loped
stagecoaches around the block — imitating
life as real, the constant goal of growing up
syringing the house full of    absolute eternity.
And I go back now almost expecting it all
to flood over me again, I leave having hated all my awareness
of long, long tunnel here in ancient Cambridge. A year, most of it
drop by drop driving down beneath Chinese worryings, twelve months
down to the last nothing glance in the mirror, the year ending me
with hatred from this dumb constant grey decision in the North,
too far from shaven wheatfields, too far from always blond
instead of black heads: — engaged by dying out of a Missouri night in bus,
circling overhead till I hoped for Rilke visions in my drying up
by the mailbox, till I break down and write along the sidewalks
Harvard leads me to boxes of scholarship —
                                                                                and not even the mysteries
of endless time into China in the characters turned out before me
open any tomorrow’s window onto Christmas, snow, intelligence
in a happy sky.
                              Having hated starvation of the toes looking
for my footsteps again, having sunk into monologue
with the portrait of Tzu Hsi gracing the commons room
for Asian specialists.
                                            But now, at least I leave unfeeling
out of rain and humidity. Today the sun is shining, shining all my mirrors
over everybody America, looking down the tall forest roads
out of this East, out of this gradual slope to sea,
back to the settlements on rivers watering only the pasts,
only my childhood, back to Kansas.
 
 My interest in visual poetry (or video poetry) began when I started doing performances. I’ve been quite interested in the possibility of writing between picture and text. It is a process of learning how to read this relationship: how text changes the picture and vice versa. I work by taking textual metaphor and breaking it down to its concrete DNA level. — Mari Laaksonen

Heinä

Nico Vassilakis returns to Jacket2 with a new feature on the current state of visual poetry in Finland. “There’s a stir going on, a textual free-for-all, a visible shift in how language is being handled in response to the machines in our lives,” he notes. “In Finland, visual poetry, in some way, sprang up almost fully formed. There are few antecedents that point to its appearance, yet here it is. The fully mature mingle with the nascent and in so doing form a new constellation of visual poetries.” for John Taggart

Train going out of the station

Walls speak, neighbors, and doors screeching

Walls speak, neighbors, “there’s no sun”

“don’t know why”
 
Everything an elevated line
Siren, dog, truck backing into a driveway, sex

Speaking from
the branch in/at each line
 
I sat in my room, a wanderer
catching prayers,
 
lifted language
from the additive
 
Spoke of it, how soon
we’ll be beginning as we end
 
How much waste the resistance
Language can be a brick wall
 
a way not to say hello, “Hello!”
Much of the time/an old story
 
Pavements here not like in Mexico
so rich we must acknowledge
 
the surface sentence
I will not let you go until …
 
You touch me city of cities
Things of the spirit touch
 
Spoke of how we all live together
buildings, bricks, a neighborhood playground

             Baroness
                  Djuna Barnes said
                                      “One thought of 
death in reverse.” Seeing 
the Baroness, one 
thought, Djuna Barnes did not say
had no need to say,
of thought itself, 
             philosophical 
                              thought, 
one thought, that is, 
of death …

Seeing 
the Baroness
one thought all
                of death that 
can be 
thought:
                  “Death in reverse”
                         
One can never think death itself
only the steps away from and towards …

One thought of death coming towards us, but in reverse.
One thought of such steps as the Baroness took or may have taken

in Munich, Cincinnati, New York, Berlin, Paris
memorable steps, unknowing steps
with a dog on a leash with several dogs 
several dogs on several leashes
The Baroness, 70 black and purple anklets
Christmas tree balls as earrings
a tea strainer around her neck
a wig of purple and gold.

The Baroness,
who once said: I have
spiritual cancer of the womb …

She steals the crepe from the door
of a funeral home and makes a dress of it …

The Baroness, 
who once said: High culture is 
only possible with emotional people …

The Baroness,
a postage stamp on her cheek,
foreign, cancelled …

The Baroness 
does not violate the rules
but enters a realm, Bodenheim said,
into which they can’t pursue her …
A realm without rules
that could appear as Dada
but Dada could also be a desert,
a dead realm of dry distance.
It is not even that she alone 
of all the Dadaists “lived Dada,” 
lived Dada as Duchamp, Man Ray and Picabia 
did not, but that the Dada she lived
was never quite Dada, was
overtly apocalyptic, was in fact 
pure Expressionism, that 
final vision to which 
she bore such true witness
in an earlier, European life,
when she was a baroness only in spirit,
a baroness purely of the spirit.
And so in all matters 
regarding Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven
there resides what can only be 
called a spiritual quality
though one never so evident 
as in the most violent of
her antagonisms,
where she shone forth
as the living instance of
“a principal of 
non-acquiescence.” (Pound) 



         *



The Baroness,
with every gesture,
ecstasy and transcendence …
The Baroness and Wagner,
The Baroness and Stephan George,
The Baroness and Wedekind, renown for
masturbating on a Munich stage.
The Baroness and the lyrics her mother loved. 
The disdain of the Baroness is, ultimately, 
less the diffidence of Duchamp
than a clear indication of 
what Kandinsky 
called for, an art of 
“internal necessity,” 
an art that called forth 
“the purposive vibration 
of the human soul …”
The Baroness, 
as Djuna Barnes said, 
“irreparably 
German.”



          *



The Baroness
before her entitlement
was prayerful,
an Art Nouveau Orpheus: 
in a forest, virginal, with lyre 
and halo in a field of flowers 
that could be nodding with 
narcotic glamour in the garden 
of Odelon Redon. As if for a moment 
she were secretly H.D., wandering 
in the woods of Rossetti
hushed, the trees all birches.
This is the sacred forest of Europe,
the green light of Celtic grail quests
and pre-Raphaelite agonies.
(Or, amid homosexuals in togas:
I am, the Baroness said, 
the berhymed adoration of 
a circle of acolytes, around the 
Weimar Mallarmé.) Still, here, 
in this painting, suppliant, 
androgynous, as if Orpheus 
were half Eurydice, as if 
Eurydice is lost within him or her, 
As if Eurydice is dead, as if
Eurydice is put to death, 
is murdered within, too 
feminine to live, in keeping 
with the adjuration of, let’s say
for the moment, de Saint Point,
the Futurist dancer and later 
convert to Islam, who said: “Let 
woman rediscover her 
own cruelty, the violence 
that makes her turn on 
the beaten, just because they 
are vanquished, and mutilate them …”



          *



Or perhaps all mythic hope
is in the end illusions, is a dead dog 
on a beach, a dog the Baroness poked 
with a stick, as Barnes observed, 
to see what it was made of,
and all possible futures find us
selling newspapers on the streets of Berlin
in the waning days of the Weimar.
Or will we all again be as a sylph 
in an entourage of aesthetes:
A brilliant, joyful sun, one says.
An unparalleled purity, says another.

Return, O Elsa Plotz, 
the classical soul of art to Italy. 
In Florence, theaters free of charge,
the doors of private galleries swing open.
By Mt. Vesuvius, above the Bay of Naples,
she sleeps in a hotel beloved of Nietzsche,
bedrooms with ceilings like churches, 
stairs, hewn rock down to the sea …
In Venice, she compels her way 
into a pornographic cabinet,
approaching the phalluses,
“as if they were antique lamps …”
The Baroness not yet the Baroness 
journeys far or not so far from 
her childhood Saturnalias on the Baltic:
“We slaughtered pigs. That’s what pigs are for …”
Finally, the Baroness not yet a baroness
is ready for New York, ready 
for rebirth in the new world,
ready for her apotheosis
as a splendidly offensive 
Demeter, in a hat 
“inconspicuously 
trimmed with gilded carrots …”



          *



The grotesque, a critic argues, is deeply congruent with Expressionist aesthetics, in which art exists around the poles of empathy and abstraction. Empathy when our relation to the world is untroubled, abstraction, when we have given up, when we seek redemption in form . . .

The Baroness
delighting as a child
in the cruel cartoons of Wilhelm Busch, 
the grandfather of the Katzenjammer Kids
“psychoanalytic before his time,” said Peter Gay.
The Baroness, a girl who especially cherished 
“Pious Helena,” a tale in which 
“a fading alcoholic beauty 
overturns her oil lamp in a drunken 
stupor, incinerating herself, 
then dropping into a boiling 
cauldron in hell where 
her cousin Franz, 
a priest, father of her twins, 
is waiting for her,” Peter Gay 
summarizes in The Cultivation of Hatred …



          *



The Baroness,
appearing in a dream to Bakhtin
so one imagines, to tell him God was a plumbing pipe … 



          *



The Baroness,
finally entitled, notes: If I eat 
I can eliminate — it is logic. It is why I eat. 
My machinery is built that way. Yours also. 
Though you do not like to think of it
Because you are not an aristocrat …



          *



The Baroness,
finally entitled, defends the
pornographer, James Joyce: Without him, without his help, 
she tells America, you would become 
less than a dog, a cow, a worm …



          *



Finally entitled
the Baroness was not, 
as one critic claimed, in herself
the mystic marriage of New York and Paris, 
but that of New York and Thebes.
Seeing as the Baroness
                           As Djuna Barnes said, 
is a citizen of terror, 
                   would that mean, 
                               and, as Barnes said it, 
could it not help but mean, 
a citizen of Thebes, 
                        a citizen of terror, as if of 
the ancient city that denied the god, 
that staged the entire drama of the arrival of Dionysus
that other death in reverse, without which western 
thought cannot be imagined.
In seeing the Baroness
we see Barnes as 
Tiresias, 
         Tiresias seeing 
the Baroness 
who is 
seeing the snake, seeing
the moment of 
union 
between man and woman, 
woman and woman, man and man, 
being and being, being and 
nonbeing, 
human and divine, 
self and soul 
who found a figure of the divine
in a piece of plumbing
which could be male genitalia
which could be the workings of the womb
which could be the valves of the heart
which could be a vortex into which 
rushes all our bodies are.

I am, the Baroness said,
the abode of terror and a snake …

Such is the pathos of the expressionist self: alienated, it would be made whole through expression, only to find there another sign of its alienation … its utterance is less an expression of its being than an address, or plea to another … for even as expressionism insists on the primary, originary, interior self, it reveals that this self is never anterior to its traces, its gestures, its “body.” 



          *



Soul: his hair is molten gold and a red pelt
Self: he is vain, not gold. His soulless beauty makes me sad

Soul: his nostrils sweep like a scythe up to his cheek.
Self: cast iron, not even death, because death has at least been life.

Soul: hammered iron will quiver. Iron is alive to flame. Are you flame?
Self: I could be.

Soul: you know you are flame, and we are one.
Self: I am your fuel; you hinder my wish to touch …

Soul: We are artisans, we flare and are satisfied, and all you say is alas.
Self: I want him to step into you through me

And you will break him down, dissolve him, build him up, shake him, make him quiver, and two will be one, “as it was in olden times.”

(After all, the Baroness as much as asks
as she opens the inquiry into her own madness
in the pages of The Little Review, can one really be 
Dionysian without dialogue, without the imagination 
of a consciousness that does not know the god, 
without the division of perspectives, the imagination 
of ignorance of the god, of estrangement of, 
from, the god, of denial of the god, without 
the knock on the gate of the city, the promise of 
gentle pleasure, or a horrific immanence …)

Soul: Are not your eyes my fingers, do they not touch 
until they form his image in me

Self: I do not want his image, my fingers suffer, 
they are my eyes, my touch is sight, my fingers caress with a look

My eyes, your fingers, grow unsteady, dim
Soul: my body, you are making me sad. Go, leave …

(Here our text seems uncertain: does the soul ask
the body to leave, or has the body asked the soul to leave?)

are they saying now together: we must wait and smile,
I am thine body, mine soul, thine revolting body

I sing my soul, the Baroness writes

Reddish complexion, pale ivory, talons finely chiseled, finely carved animal, cast iron animal, chiseled animal, with hands, that never was born, I touch them, they quiver, I kiss them, they grasp, tear, draw blood

Cave animal, animal of shadow, around the edges it runs over with crimson, 

his hair is molten gold and a red pelt

golden eyes, eyes of a toad, hidden behind shining surfaces of glass,
jewels hidden in his head, a toad, a king on a read throne, dreaming he is a bee

is this the toad at the roots of the tree of the great work, Saturnine, associated with the First Matter, alchemical Baroness, her soul is a toad ugly and venomous, “Wears yet a precious jewel in his head.” As Shakespeare might observe … 



          *



Now we see 
the Baroness smoking 
pot in a china pipe “that must 
have held half an ounce or more …”



          *



Now we see 
the Baroness opening 
a scarlet raincoat: over her nipples, 
two tomato cans, held up with green string around her back
between the tomato cans, a very small bird cage
with a live canary …



          *



Now we see
the Baroness stripping 
the bachelors bare, the bride with red nail polish.
The Baroness is the future, Duchamp said.



          *



Now we see
the Baroness looking 
at me through her blue-white 
crazy eyes and saying: “are you afraid to 
let me kiss you?” I was shaking all over when 
I left the dark stairway, and came out on 14th street …



          *



Now we see
the Baroness, smearing
emerald paint on her cheeks
eyelashes of gilded porcupine quills …



          *



Now we see
the Baroness with ropes 
of dried figs around her neck,
in deep poverty, facing deportation, 
speaking to an embassy bureaucrat 
“rustling coquettishly” 



          *



Now we see 
how the click of her eyelashes 
make her, she says, irresistible …



          *



Now we see 
the Baroness expelled 
nonetheless from Germany, 
scheming to get a visa for France,
wearing a birthday cake on her head,
not long before her suicide …



          *



About a hundred years ago
in New York City, a woman 
from Germany became a Baroness 
became, possibly the last truly regal figure 
the earth could sustain, an entitlement
verified in city hall in 1913,
the year of the Armory show.
Scholars have yet to determine
If the Armory Show was 
In fact, her bridal shower … 
So: a woman from Germany
becomes a Baroness, and later, 
roams around gathering up outcast items 
and makes them art, brings together 
grain and metal and wood
in a way that explains
how the universe works
an immigrant, a Baroness, 
a woman, Djuna Barnes said, 
“undismayed about the facts of life,”
on whose cheeks might be found
on certain ceremonial occasions
streaks of mustard color
a woman who, on the way 
to her wedding, finds a metal ring
on the street, a sign of Venus
and her touch makes it so
forever, a woman 
whom it would not be 
unwarranted to characterize 
as abrasive, charming, devastated, 
frightfully hilarious, bringing her spectacular grief
at so much death and abandonment
to the forest of Manhattan 
of which Mina Loy 
once said: 
“No one who has not lived in 
New York has lived in the Modern world.”
the Baroness in the years of her honeymoon
and her grieving “amid the turmoil, 
Ezra Pound said, of yids, letts, finns, Estonians, 
cravats, niberians, Nubians, Algerians 
sweeping along 8th Avenue 
in the splendor of 
their vigorous, 
unwashed animality …”



          *



Williams and Stevens and Mina Loy 
are sleeping. The Baroness is in her basement
befriending vermin, granting sanctuary to insects
amassing the glories of a secret regency
stepping onto the street, arrayed, 
shaved, painted, dyed, bedecked
to bring art to America,
a country that, unfortunately,
was so given to mercantilism that
it might never be much better than a Jew …



          *



Now we see
the Baroness arriving
at a soiree for an opera singer
in a bright blue dress, a peacock fan, 
on her head, the lid of a coal 
scuttle strapped under 
her chin like a helmet
two mustard spoons 
hang like feathers 
beside her face
She knows the voice 
in all its throes,
intelligible and otherwise.
She has long known 
the dream of a total artwork,
that modernity could be transfigured
by a glorious ritual art, a new myth
could bring gods into being.
the Baroness knew what 
an aria could accomplish
had composed, after all, 
her own threnody, 
her own deathwail, her own
“metaphysical speculations on consolation”
in a language beyond language,
a pure lament, a music 
that anyone could understand,
that any grief could enter, that could 
recover, possibly, the soul blown apart by the world:

Ildrich mitzdonja — astatooch
Ninj — iffe kniek —
Ninj — iffe kniek —
Arrkarr — barr
Kararr — barr —

Arr —
Arrkarr —
Mardar
Mar — doorde — dar —



          *



At the soiree, the Baroness
had a chance to mingle with the stars —

I sing only for humanity, the opera singer said.
I wouldn’t lift a leg for humanity, the Baroness said …Editorial note: Jacket2 is very happy to present this portfolio of eleven new poems by Norman Fischer, which accompanies Zen Monster editor Brian Unger’s essay “Norman Fischer: A ‘test case for being.’”  Fischer was also the subject of PoemTalk #38, for which host Al Filreis was joined by Linh Dinh, Julia Bloch, and Frank Sherlock. — Michael S. Hennessey
 
Test Case
It’s quiet or in the quiet
Where the tongues of disjunction lick the arms of affection
And one plus one’s not two
It doesn’t follow from this …
All the strange words summon him
The strange arms embrace him
In the ever-persistent end-game
Where world’s objects pretend to lurk
They are not there
My hard-earned cash
Your vaunted self-esteem —
Halted, halted
Not a psychological fact,
This love like syrup poured upon a willing head
In a storm
In its wake. What pleasure is there
In simple deconstruction
Of all I think, feel
Let thought’s river flow
Uncanny occurrence
Test case for being
 
 
 
Odysseus Speaks
I sail to keep from crying
Or cry to keep from sailing
Truth is a lie, I lie
To find some truth
Memory is song: it works
By song, otherwise how re-
Member anything from within
Memory’s myth (the sirens know this)
The gods are memory’s memory
And I can’t live a single day
Without their song that means
Something but what
I speak to keep from sailing, crying,
Speak to lie to find some truth
Not making a quiddity, no word
Process but a meaningful, memorable,
Exhale, then an inhale,
Exhale, after which
Words pour forth, my darling lies
My oars, my foment
 
 
 
Forgiveness
What are we trying to get at here?
Would you hold that up so I can see it?
In remembrance of things
That are here in front of us
Looking right at us
In this case they remain themselves
Talking within earshot
Hydrants and honeysuckle,
Enjambed declensions
In the house, the garden
Where one belongs, place
Made of itself, “that was an experience,
I experienced it” and down you go,
Buried in time, or over and out,
Why pretend or boast?
She shot a look at him,
Determined to be seen, to be correct in that,
Determined analytically, crossing out
The parts that “don’t fit”
And fitting them in, they are not
Crossed out
In what vocabulary
Do I see the hawk
Shrug her massive shoulders
Do I see a blackbird,
Wing as whisper, fall
Toward roof-edge
To soar then set upon
The grass of the earth
Presence ensconced in words,
Demanded, scored,
Delivered as promised
Isn’t the world promising, green
Again, so why say anything?
I am quiet, still,
I persist
As the world ends
Together in that case
And tearing each other
Apart as we would want
Inwardness commences
It takes two to create life, it scares us,
We want to get rid of it altogether
Forgive us who know not what we do
 
 
 
And so to leave with a noteworthy swagger’s
Not lexically popular but anyhow’s an improvement over rote
Possibilities, this little cute pet person one is and used to be,
Like lint or steam or a curtsy for the queen
Something commonplace and polite
That ends when the many run amok convinced
The world was made for them that they seize it with their meat hooks like a chop
Purring all the while like a cat, cooing crooner lyrics
That saturate the airways and the waves
Till storms’ peaks droop over the whole show
Beginning at the beginning, just between the times of hope
That got cast out toward the edges of the lawn
Like lariats at a bar mitzvah
Or confetti at a masquerade ball —
Still, hope or hoop manages to compute
On the grand mathematical scales
As on the ones that obscure always
The eyes
 
 
 
Nothing Matters
Nothing matters
But the quality
Of the affection
In the end
Nothing matters
But the quality
Of the affection, how
Smooth, how
Rough,
Nothing matters
But the quality
At the end of
The affection, how it
Wears, its weal,
Nothing matters
But the survival
Of the affection
Rough or smooth
If it is possible
In the end
Nothing matters
But affection
One cannot speak it
One cannot speak of it
In the end
Did you expect
To go on
Forever, that we would
Go on forever
That there would be
No end to us
Our life here
As there’s an end
To anything
In the quality
Of the affection
Find the end
In the beginning
Savor that, its force
A satisfactory completion
Woe to them
That conquer with armies
Whose only right is might
 
 
 
Soap, Thyme, and Brie
I am human, I ring the bell
Behind the grocery or appliance store
Behind the bank or big box
Where the reprimanded people lurk
Was a complaint lodged against me?
With consequences to be meted out?
Truncating time so it didn’t count?
Confounding place so it didn’t sound?
The hyena calmly counting cactus stalks
On an abacus, someone commented that
“That’s the way it’s done around here”
But there was no sense that this was so
The hyena was simply improvising
Having been a bassoon in a previous life
Where did these various life forms
That came forth then come forth from?
Why, from inside (if there is an inside
Inside this contraption) does it all look
So different, so muffled and smoky
As if seen from a precipice in a dream?
These are critical categories in the shade
Echoes or murmurs in the sea-foam haze
The voyage out and no
Voyage back
Which is tougher
Where the band plays on
The march goes forth
Evoking ancient tales
What’s the motivation, the aura?
As we know, have been instructed,
That line of silent trees
Bears the burden forward
The need to be
Such as it is
 
 
 
Expensive Arrangements
It is indicative of the loose arrangements
That apply in this place
That those who pose as bosses
Don’t really know any better
And all the sophisticated prototypes
Have lately been misconstrued — all about
Themselves they heap their ribbons
And these flow on as if crystalline into the bare and tidy
Nights that give us all pause
And not a little glow, so that our friends
Can better see us as we leave
In a series of city blocks, arranged like long pegs
In baize drawers one loses track too quickly
Of the sense of things
The purpose for which this little hunting party
Has been organized
Which is why the others
Long for such clarified sentences
They want the clear demarcations
That money as money, hefty money,
Would provide and do not see the colorists
Are making themselves out to be
Anything but what they are, as if the shapes we see
Were the shapes they are, and they are not
But it’s impossible to tell —
If you stretch this cloth any tighter
I think surely your bell will crack
And where would any of us be at that point
Other than East of here
In the other language we spoke
Before we knew then what we know now
In a new convention
As clear as anything is
Despite all the gasses
 
 
 
If You Say So
Notorious urges urge us on to denials
But what’s the difference? Mere taste?
But what does one taste and why does one stand for it
Or stand in for it, for something
Or anything else
Does a word stand in for
What the word stands for and how dare a word
Stand if only on its own steam, on my two feet
Dearer by far, a sensation of balance and deterioration
Only once I say so to myself
So I am more humble
In recognition of the limits of knowledge
I’m continually impressed
By the ever-advancing range
Of my stupidity, how even what’s plain as day
As the nose on my face
Remains blind to me, won’t receive me
For all my filial chattering
What could this be, an age of huts,
Era of darkness even in midst of such
Information showers, such illuminating facts
I’m unsure of any delinquency on my part
For I have always been here as far as I am concerned
 
 
 
A Flatter Form of Research
What can be seen, which means what
You or I can say we see can’t be the limit
Or the norm of what may be as they say
“Out there” which I guess means it’s not me
Or you and we are not it which does leave us rather
High and dry and this is not a matter of opinion
Ah art, etc, to be improvised upon, a new-fangled form
Of investigation — one wants description
For it, the thing we are, the life, one wants verification
Of the pedigree but then that will never work
Will it, for clouds are only such in the world we know
Never the world beyond that world, the world
That makes the world a world by virtue of what’s not in it
Or of it or round it so smooth
It all comes down to a single stone
In the eye of the beholder
Now we have a brain over here
And over there a jar of water
Let us mix the two and observe the action
See it glisten and dissolve
Into rancor or desire for one wants
To be more than that — whatever that ever is
A pushing toward a limit which can’t be transgressed
Even on pain of nothing
 
 
 
Rugged Individualism
Here’s a dollar amount, a little regular parcel
To be pieced out into irregulars, militias
For the protection of the like-minded, the family
It must mean identity, “A is A, it is not B”
For how could “B” be “A” unless we decide to say so
It is not logical nor is it ordinary, it is precisely
Extraordinary that I am not I I am you or otherwise
The reverse would be true, see the terms unglue
Themselves even as we speak, as they tighten,
So that we never know who speaks or why
And can’t know how to listen, what to listen for
And therefore can’t interpret
But only fall slowly and desperately asleep
As did our ancestors
The minions of them that ate each other as they
Rolled their “r’s” to sound Irish or English or Welch
Lets eat our words like butter
There’s nothing dim about it, and this page isn’t full
Of things, it’s empty of them, all of them,
Stacks and racks and piles of them
I’m speaking of dishes, flatware, and enamel serving ware
The heft of it, the sound it makes
When shattering

На 30‑м году своей жизни …
Из старого стихотворения
На 59‑м году с сигаретой во рту,
 еще боле плешивый, вновь оказался на пороге двери
 лицом к заходящему февральскому солнцу,
 за которым собачья звезда на ветру нежно скреблась
 в предчувствии ночи
 и множество теснилось предметов,
 и каждый был дольше, чем глазу ресница,
 а также сияло
 стесненье имен, в разлученье
 которых взор проникнуть не в силах, —
 да и не нужно, — вне очертаний маятник вещи,
 перешивающий память.
 
 Однако солнце слабело, и его умаление
 раздвигало пределы прорех.
 Желтые лампы тлели навылет, и птицы с улыбками
 падали в стекла. Но звук отставал,
 а потом его было не слышно. Хлопок.
 И дело даже не в этом, не в повторенье того,
 что известно; возможно, в короткой догадке о том,
 что пятьдесят девять лет уместились
 в несколько строк, на дне которых мерцает
 проточная пряжа.
 (Жижа прозрачности и прощения; перечисления
 достигнешь конца, достигнешь бессмертия,
 воск в верху глаза под веком, конъюнктивит,
 кипарисы, даты прощания), —
 приумножение строк — сколько теперь? —
 не прибавят ни слова
 даже к первому слогу, не упоминая о выдохе.
 Иней ярче на ощупь. Терять нечего —
 разве что снег во рту, — поэтому не о чем говорить.
 А потому все как надо. О дальнейшем нет смысла.
 По многим причинам. И не спрашивай, пожалуйста,
 куда переехал, что взял с собой,
 
 кому пишу письма, каким уловкам отдаю предпочтение …
 
 мир настолько просторно сквозит,
 
 что в нем нет ни места, ни смерти.
 
 
 
 
 
 
For Many Reasons
En l’an trentiesme de mon aage
(from an old poem)
Fifty-ninth year, with a cigarette between lips,
 ever more bald, I again found myself on the threshold of a door,
 facing the setting February sun,
 the dog star in the wind made gentle scratching noises behind it
 in expectation of night
 as a multitude of objects thronged to,
 each of them longer than an eyelash to an eye,
 also there glowed
 crush of names, their fault
 the eye cannot enter, it hasn’t the force — and what
 would be the point — nothing delineates the thing’s pendulum
 that sews memory over again.
 
 Yet the sun was weakening, and its wane
 rendered rents more rotund.
 Yellow lamps smoldered right through, and birds smilingly
 dropped into windows. As for sound, it lagged behind,
 and then you couldn’t hear it at all. Clap.
 Still, even that’s not the point, not in repeating
 what we know already; it might be in the sudden surmise
 that fifty-nine years fit
 into several lines, over whose floor flickers
 the flowing yarn.
 (Liquid of clarity, charity; come you will
 to the end of number; come
 to immortality, wax under the eyelid, conjunctivitis,
 cypresses over vales, dates of valediction), —
 multiplication of lines — how many now? —
 won’t add a word
 even to the first syllable, if not for the exhale.
Rime looks bright to the touch. There’s nothing to lose —
except for snow in the mouth — so nothing to talk about.
That’s why all is as it must be. No sense speaking of what follows.
For many reasons. And don’t ask, please,
where I moved to, what took along,

whom I write letters to, what ruses prefer to rely on …

the world is so drafty and spacious

there is neither place in it, nor death.
 



 
 
 
A мне и не убежать никуда. Во-первых,
рассматриваю страницу, на которой это написано.
Во-вторых, разные фотокамеры, серебряные ложки, тени.
Буквы, которые расклеваны между теней, разное...
даже и отражение на всякий случай. Я вижу еще —
окно. И у меня болит голова. И она болит сильнее.
«Не убежать никуда» становится
неким оперным пением. А мне и не нужно
никуда убегать. Лучше — чтобы голова «пополам».
И петь, а лучше никого не видеть, типа «прощай»
тогда, — быстрее и легче. А иногда вина
и зеленый лист. Подержать в руках,
а потом зажечь сигарету.

 
 
 
 
And it’s not like I can run off somewhere. First,
I’m poring over the page this is written on.
Second, all sorts of photo cameras, silver spoons, shadows.
Letters that are pecked out among shadows, various …
reflections even, just in case. Also I see
a window. And I have a headache. And I have more of a headache.
“Not like I can run off somewhere” becomes
a kind of opera singing. Why should I even need to
run off somewhere. Better my head split “in two.”
To sing — better, without seeing anybody — something like “farewell”
then, it’s faster and easier that way. And occasionally some wine
and a green leaf. To feel it in my hands,
and then light up a cigarette.
 

 
 
 
Сны, которые видят фотографов 
шелкография для гипса ноги Анатолия Барзаха
«Умираем». Значит ли, что цветы никнут, как.
Означает ли, что крошатся многословием пепла —
а мы в других странах и нет паспорта,
транспорта, какая-то Касабланка, станция.
Тронь что-либо, а потом, много спустя,
после расслоится «тем временем».

Одно «лишь». Значит ли, что жест мерцает
сквозняком в переходах, где точке
не суждено преступить меру ряби,
когда ты равен сумме зрачка и влаги;
закат в ней вогнут залогом. Воздух темен —
кто дышит им? Черств и сомкнут.
Сух. Как пляж беспечен. Ты вообще — репейник,
матрица уподобления в устье цвета,
 
налет зернистый на языке, кислотная забава
послеполуденного расписания. Ключа латунного
на восковом шнурке отпечаток в стекле.
Лед ли, таянье — и то и другое
голубям привычно на аметистовых.
Впрочем, слова беструдны. С нами: «склоны», «пята»,
«счисление» соочередностей тетивы. Также
дурное пение. Да нет... вот и окно в полуметре,
рукой подать, — огромное,
как сухарь жевать деснами.
К тому же давно открыто... Ни прорезей крови,
бессмертие в ржавой извести. Ничто
не омрачает руку, тем паче белое поле тушью.
 



Dreams Photographers Appear To
a silkscreen for Anatoly Barzakh’s leg cast 
“We are dying.” Does this mean that flowers are wilting, how.
Does it mean they are crumbling with the prattle of ash —
while we are in other countries, without passports,
no transportation, some Casablanca, a station.
Touch anything and then, much later,
“in the meanwhile” will stratify afterwards.

Just “merely.” Does it mean that the gesture shimmers
like a draft in a passage, where a point
can never surpass the measure of ripples,
when you equal the sum of your pupil and moisture;
the sunset curled into it like a pledge. The air is dark —
who breathes it? Clenched and stale.
Dry. Like a beach, untroubled. You’re just a thistle,
an assimilation matrix for the stoma of color,

a grainy film on the tongue, acid amusement
of a free afternoon. A glass print
of a brass key on a wax string.
Ice or thaw — either one being
habitual to doves on the amethyst —
In any case, words give no work. With us are: “slopes,” “heel,”
“numbering” of bowstring co-oscillations. Also out of tune
song. Yet no … there’s the window
half a meter away, within reach — enormous,
like chewing croutons with your gums.
Besides, it’s long been open … No hemorrhaging,
immortality in rusty quicklime. Nothing
darkens the hand, no ink falls on the white field.
 

 
 
Agora 
Железная дорога. Несколько утративший очарование «предмет» представления? Либо явление, чьи границы ни в чем не определены. Вокзал, аэропорт, почтовая станция, узлы иной лимфатической природы. В не явственно выраженном, однако довольно известном месте между представлением и помышлением возникает «иная материальность». Не помню, почему несколько лет тому возникло желание заново «переписать троянскую войну». Сегодня кажется, это было необходимо, как и любая случайность, поскольку «дном истории» залегал «щит Ахилла» почти как затертая монета в песке под водой. У воображения дно предстает будущим отражением. Дело не в том, что едва ли не каждый брался за «описание» щита, а в том, что щит постепенно обретал черты «вавилонской башни», машины транспозиции. Затем вместо искомой фотографии несколько строк, не вошедших в книгу «Распределение», обязанной как собственному легкомыслию, так и незавершенности «троянской войны». Мне интересно не «к чему», а «из чего». Впрочем, это легко меняется местами.
 
 
AgoraBeyond the Helplessness Principle
Something will occur and at once it will be found
among other occurrences I know
that the heaviest dreams are only an illusion
I know it from experience I see my own
experience now that it is over
Of course it is still alive statistical
and divine
 
Later on the poem
does not ask me any questions
about my wife kids work and photography
I just let it drink
from the well Your water
is hard clear with a note of iron
it says and it drinks greedily
like some kind of refugee
heretic
 

 
 
 
 
Macroethicist 
I have come downstairs to get
something to eat
 
To rinse the throat To replenish the supply
of minerals On the wall
quiet and promising
lightly trembled one gigantic
drop of water
 
It has gathered into itself
dust a pill
a model of the ocean
a postcard from memory
Natural sediment
nutritious and well-balanced
 
Keep it I say
Don’t compile Don’t add to it
If it’s the leak
you’ve been waiting for wait
until you say something
 
 

 
 
 
Advanced Driving Lessons
Our lives are calculated
at one hundred and twenty kilometers
per hour or even two hundred
and if you stay hungry you can live
to be one hundred and fifty It’s in your genes
 
Our generation met in the corridors
of institutions where we work full-time
but we cannot be found there within the walls
of former headquarters of the secret police
which remember those times We call each other
and arrange for further canceled meetings
 
This is history and all this sugar is the result
of my travels Eight years ago in Greece
the ferryman gave me high blood pressure but I can sleep now
surrounded by sweetness In magazines they write so much about life
but we’re losing our position
because of a wave of new opinion polls
 

 
 


 
No Time
The world functions like a cooperative
Reciprocally It trades in literally
everything It’s lonely
and it travels with one piece of luggage
without moving No matter what you say
it’s already in the bag At least there’s always
some beginning and right away
a far-sighted sequence of events
The watch runs on bacteria and frost
appears grainy like in real life
as forecast but different
you can’t see it and there’s no
condensation to give it the fullness of a dream
in which the sense of touch the conductor
cancels the ticket What remains is the feel
of foreign languages Good morning
I am from here and there I am like a Dane
in Europa Like Eskimos in Antarctica How can I get
to the nearest place and can I have
a light I’m perfecting my tenses because they thrill me
to the bone They make me hot Past continuous
Future perfect Another difficult tense
is the present simple
 

 
 


 
Practically Speaking
Try to put yourself in my situation
when there is no situation Every day
I have to give my all and work for a living
Play for high stakes Sort through portfolios
that hold clues to sudden desires
attached to the bra straps and collarbones of women
Every day some sort of weather
corrects itself with us in the background
in which you can also be seen
as you put yourself in your situation
and try to comprehend the background of events
There’s a hospital in the background and cases of malpractice
finally reach an arbitrary limit
like longer verse forms
without the showy repetitions so obligatory
today A summons arrives
from the tax office and if you appear
at the appointment with the right official
notebook in hand you can correct
your record They’ll forgive you Everything
all the logistics will come into play
The cell phone ring tones will harmonize
and float through your mind as usual
like the juice of our practical experience
 

 
 


 
The Notary of Finitude
This lady and this gentleman are potential buyers
of one of the plots in our real estate listings
therefore they will acquire plotlessness
 
This gentleman is an important representation
of another gentleman’s interests
and so sometimes he has interests in representation
 
The figures gathered in the small yard
are parents But other plots of land
know them as parties to a conflict
 
Oh assets Oh groups Oh heavens
of interests Shed your light upon us
in our assigned plots
 

 
 
 
A Fairytale World
A girl with a bottle of bleach
is writing me a ticket for illegal
parking and she says that I am here for a check
for her impending death Her spirit
 
is making a deal with me that it will be haunting
the city sanitation department Mine is a police car
and the girl asks me once more
what time is it and the curfew
 
With a ticket or without you owe a hypothesis
which has not lived long enough to become obsolete
 

 
 


 
Realism Protocols A
You strand of virus that writhes at the tip of the penis
you sway the hosts of nations
 
You string of immune bacteria
researchers admire you and work harder more efficiently for you
 
You mutation that lurks in the nucleus
you are the gate to the future
 
You toxic particle that taints the nervous systems of the unborn besides the taste of local
            waters
you too are included in the calculations
 
You artificial currency over which nations wage wars thus encouraged to greater productivity
we bring you baskets full of the harvest
 
You spreadsheet from robbery so clean that it is invisible
I see your point and admire it
 
You violence unleashed on the sick and helpless
what else will you say
 
You grass, grass, grass, and grass again
vegetate on us you will not be sorry
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Realism Protocols B
 
You blob of mucus that I am
I greet you
 
You nicotine inhaling that shot through my parents’ entrails in days of yore
I bow to you
 
You lump of dust that has consented to assume my shape
I thank you
 
You knot of circumstance long dispersed into dirt and dust
Be hailed
 
 
You emulsion that peeled off the photographs of beloved faces and flowed into silicates and
           pyroclasts
You shine for us in darkness
 
You drool of dust courageously bonded by grease and sperm for a few hours before dry wind 
           blows
You nourish eternally
 
You albumin that has undergone numberless petrifications before you became a synapsis in a 
           child’s head
Glory be with you
 
 
You generous specks, lobopodia, rich phlegm, you particles converging from nowhere onto 
           this poem
Let us rejoice
 
Ovulation Blues
Nothing for it these days but Lipton tea with
chapbooks by Bohdan Zadura or practicing elocution
in front of the brown mirror.
 
At the bus stop, blowing your nose straight into
the trash, holding one nostril,
and in the Czech manner mixing up the bus numbers,
but it makes no difference: they both end up at the same place.
 
Nothing for it but washing your hands of everything
that matters and doesn’t, of all the lost battles,
once and for all. Accidentally breathing in the dust
from the soles of your shoes, by the street lamp a winking eye:
a run in your fishnet stockings.
 
They call this a wide frame of reference
if it means something to anyone.
 
Nothing for it these days but recycling bottles
for more emptiness, for more.
 

 
 


Graffiti
It could be another poem like this one: you go somewhere
leaving behind a scorched city, though really you were
the only one smoked out of there. The high voltage power lines between
us haven’t broken down. Beep beep, goes the telegraph.
 
“Read poetry or you will be fucked up.” Graffiti on the wall
of a music hall brings out smiles in the dark room
like photographs. (Nobody signed it. The least literal
of meanings is the only one that lasts.) When you’ve had
 
eight beers the next one no longer matters, the idea comes back,
a hiccupping drunken declaration: “Read poetry or …”
(In the morning no one will remember.) Another
bar where you’re just like a letter — all burnt up.
 
 

 
 
 
Recent Times
She came back to the starting point, beyond the light,
calm and certain. Optimistic about people and reading,
conscientious, at the keyboard six hours a day.
Winter is over, and the bottom line is that we got
 
through it warm. Numbed by the cold
I discover new forms: MTV without sound, a monthly magazine,
Your Cell Phone, a diary years afterward. The mess
aggravates beyond reason, the lack of cigarettes
 
is so annoying it’s funny. The pile of papers
contains one simple story, without a moral. A man
gets lost in the ending, the story is fragmented
and the point makes a small impact. Leave it, I’ll clean it up.
 
 

 
 
 
Class of 1994
Advanced French. Our bible is Sartre, our Faust
von Daniken. A new sensitivity is yet to come.
Sex hovers at the edges of enviable dates,
the notion of obligation we grasp vaguely, time relatively.
Some girls have the bad luck to understand to the fullest
the complexity of chance, others worry too much
about the fate of Leukon. The channels of perception will burst any day
releasing the fruit of the very first choices. We know nothing,
but already the end of our history is being written;
though each believes she can protect herself,
if not she will not —
 
 

 
 
 
A Long May
I can accept I can hand over my new life
you’ll express your opinion about it in a letter or in a while
unexpectedly sensibly when I start to think us
when they start to talk about us when you suggest
to them these are still adjustments speaking tactfully
vague impressions out of concern for me
because we do have intuitions sometimes so
what’s important is corpus christi is coming up my birthday
you’ll explain your decision unless you don’t want to
then I won’t insist I won’t accept I won’t hand over
I am a carrier now only that
  

 
 
 
Emancipation
A certain woman read a lot: feminists everywhere
put up a sign HEIDEGGER YOU KANT, no idea
why, for lack of something else to do? The 2000 dictionary
is silent on the matter, their drinks got cold, before going
to bed she liked to pour herself a nightcap. As a victim
of bad circulation (the second cycle) love made
her ill (you can’t make fun of illness)
but she was brave she went to war she blew down
a paper house, and then she dug up
the telephone in the park.
 
 

 
 
 
Not a Word
One two an omen’s due
dark woods I’ll go through
I’ll watch it all as I go
croaked the old crow
 
Far away a dream betrayed
two people one shade
your half my quarter
death baked the cake to order
 
Tick tock who’s gone
darkness waits beneath the limes
the sky it seems has gone away
over me the sky remains
 
Zip zap darkness light
I’ll have it all a while longer
the bad old crow died of hunger
it didn’t happen twice
 
 

 
 
 
Scenes from a Good Day
Yes I was even from birth a daughter an engineer
a love of perfection and a fondness for details
with difficulty I choose with the glue of chance that has no taste
sometimes even Mohammed must go to the mountain
 
sometimes even Mohammed must go to the bathroom
no one is a prophet in his own bathroom
the world hardly tries to provide me with an episode
in someone else’s life yet unfortunately such scenes
 
don’t win Oscars hastily prearranged smaller
prizes dilute the bitter heartburn a little apart to the end
on the spinning reel you will stay young
and forever you will go toward the iron sun
 
 

 
 
 
People Are Bad
People are bad. Let him know, the one who dreams: he’s wrong.
Even in a dream they boil tar that rhyme stirs.
The tar made of names and hearts is boiling; we made love today in
the poplar dust; we waded in hills of leaves,
 
by the playground, in a dream. Without swearing until the end;
the sun will throw down leaves; the hurt song will awaken
a call for blood. People are simply bad. Newspapers give you to edit
just like a death contract. This park is clenching into a fist.
 
They aren’t bad at the bottom of their hearts, no. They could have loved
you even; but to read? No, none of this: From
a veil, her black train, she made curtains out of it (and
she knows and I know), you know: People are simply bad. They will dig
 
a hole for you, wherever you want. Each one will throw you a little clod
on the surface of the lid, which will stifle sound. They peck pigeons
and they will fondly recite the poem from your letters; they will bring back to life lying
and fading tears. It’s not enough for you? So go to sleep, people are only bad.

after John Ashbery
 
No charges of treason — yet — so the property
 remains untouched if not untaxed.
 And surely bigger banks and asses have been broken
 in half or into, making for happy thieves.
 Timeless hands have made valueless change.
 (Honey, here you are with a toothpick
 when what’s required is a meat cleaver.)
 The TV trays are all set up, dinner’s in the oven,
 There’s raspberry trifle for dessert.
 A robe awaits wearer, hangs limp and ill-formed,
 gathers light and stillness and regrets.
 
 The logic of wicks made for a proper burn,
 patches of light illuminating the gray,
 the house seems lighter if no less solemn
 now that the departed has returned home.
 The diary contains cries of every color,
 an orchard of thorn and briar and bane.
 The academy of the future has closed doors.
 It is unwilling — books banned, curtains drawn.

Coleman’s “In No Time at All,” written after John Ashbery, is a powerful ars poetica. Coleman’s poem shares a core value with Ashbery in its resistance against that which is “fixed” in place. Further, it may be that Coleman saw something of her own independent vision in aspects of Ashbery. The poem’s second stanza reveals more germane as well subtle affinities between both poets. She writes: “The diary contains cries of every color, / an orchard of thorn and briar and bane.” Yet Coleman’s poem and its aesthetic verve are distinctly her own. Her uncompromising voice reaches off the page: “(Honey, here you are with a toothpick / when what’s required is a meat cleaver.)” And from the first to the closing lines, as in so many of Coleman’s most striking poems, the stakes are of the highest import: “No charges of treason — yet” and “The academy of the future has closed doors.” It is an honor to publish Coleman’s poem here. — Thomas Devaney and Marcella Durand— Robert Duncan

Or to turn again to what we have known
by other days —
                                   come home
                                   to this house and yard —
                                                                                    the eye
                                   into the spring immediacy
                                   of images, lanes, right turns, old
                                   hedge rows and stone
                                   fences, fields simply —
 
                                   the eye opens not by night’s
                                   or day, day’s
                                   or wished open for,
                                   but that we are turned
                                   to — I do not know when
                                   the clouds will cover or uncover
                                   the sun (moon) but wait in its shining
                                   to see the leaves veined
                                   taken from the pear tree, dirt
                                   dug up by the hose nozzle
                                   watering the flowers.
 
You are
come home. Till it
opens, but come
 
to where it opens
 
                                        Having crossed
the street, or the whole country, distance
that has been carried
in me, wasn’t it? the crossing
back
 
is to myself — simply
to this Fort Scott
or this house and grass on S. Eddy, that
will be lost back again at leaving them,
 
but to myself in them.
 
Or this would not be so simple,
or this would not be
a homecoming, or I would not
have seen again, what looks by now
The eye opened
 
                                                                      Open the gates
                                                                      And the flowers
 
                                                                      must be watered

The people I love are
only in the distances.  — The red
field of blackberry thickets to cross
in an empty lot, a backyard
 
in another city, stays with me. —
To even think of those few people, last nights
seen, across the table, eating, or
at some last noon meal, out of a window,
 
driving away. And the photograph
carried, I have walked out of,
even the red leaves of those berry vines
have torn what old pants and the legs
 
through them, again? I have
come home, walked through
whatever that distance was I had like a wall
in front of me, into a calm there, old references,
 
relevances, the opening of the clenched fist to go home,
old house and town grown up from,
in me.  And the people I love,
are in what distances now?
 
                                       *
 
                       They come down from the city
                       and look over the old town again
                       and knock it, crank out
                       the whole lot of hard words, or the empty
 
                       ones about old times, old memories, old
                       buddies gone off, great times. But get red,
                       and drink beer, and fed up enough with it,
                       go back home.
 
              I even feel, coming back to Fort Scott,
              even the same
              visiting of relatives, my father, and enjoy
              his house for a while, as easily, not my own
              living room and icebox
                   (Relish the ease, and
                     settle the relatives
 
                     for another year) —
 
              If there were no focus here, of what
              to look into, it would be the same
              as that (if there had not been
              the try, in other places, the whole world
              already, or the tries already    here, back from the Army
              wandering around in the rain? —
                   They don’t have
              coming back to the old / home / town
              from wherever, other city,
                   or have
              even in the home they’ve made — job, family,
              or these streets,
              where there is no light to focus
              or care about a light.
 
                                       *
 
Love, for what people, finally?  Can I
restrict it?  come down
to say there is no light to focus
in those people, names after names I read
in the News Briefs in the paper, come back
to visit —
 
                     or into (as certain as) this
old land come back to, my own
past’s references still flowing here —
To what people come down
those references?
 
The people I love, the people
I do not even know — in all
 
their distances. What light
I can even see to see
If it is or is not there
 
Where the figures are
in the landscape. And when I
come to them, wave
as if across a field
 
To meet
yet, in this landscape, in these
flowers, quiet,
opening and closing in the backyard —
 
the distances where are
still the people I love, where love
is, to come to as certainly
 
as this house.
 
 
3.                                                                           for Elie
Otherwise, what am I talking about?
 
The lines of the fields I knew as a child
from books I read,
run on down to the sea
north of Boston.
 
I cannot see you there now. That
was the first drive
into the country of my mind
come real. I only see you
 
over and over on the bed,
out of the sunlight in that room, sweated.
That before, might as well have been
as imaginary as that land. It is out of that
 
we can come back to each other? Or find
whatever country — even in the other room
of that apartment — we were not in before, is
its own unknown country, or land
 
thought of as so well known, its real
face was never seen before, our own,
opening into each other, only now
in this distance, separated, we come to.
 
Or else, what am I talking about,
where is the fire of flow of
all relevances
that goes on and on, I am come home to.

The kids across the alley still lose themselves in the hollyhocks,
in the next block from their own
is another country — and the country
is what is still left, age or not, mine
 
or their own Now, flows, the way
streets run here, or the constant going and coming
of their dad’s car back there,
and goes on off all directions from this town.
 
I look west
                            (is the next block)
 
                            I look right inward, only
                            to be expert in home cosmography
 
cross the border,
hasn’t ever stopped under this town
since it was founded, the flow
under the efforts stationed on it —
 
where I have found my bloodstream pulse
countable, the grass does not end,
where the eye is opened
in me, and the heart
 
beats home to.

Cambridge, Mass.                        — Flow wonders.
                                                    As words, the generative meat music of their materiality 
and consonance of their inner contours. As worlds, his own, from Harlem and before and 
after, as well as those drawn from those inexhaustible interior wellsprings, revealing new 
ways of thinking and living.
                                                                                                                             Bars, bridges, Baruch
 Spinoza, Babel; polymathy, phalluses, subtle patterns, prose; toilets, theories, Times 
Square, tales; möbius-essays, piss-stained crotches, bitten nails. He pierces the sweat 
flesh of the known and unknown, always witting, for there is no concept or idea that 
remains impermeable to him.
                                                                                                              What is speculation, one of 
his fortes, but the capacity to raise one’s antennae to the invisible, to divine what hovers 
on the other side of what’s near or far away? What are ideas, which he wields with a 
magician’s legerdemain, but the thing seen or unseen, at the level of abstraction?
                            What is fiction, which he creates as an indelible art, but the conjuration 
and extension of the metonymic beyond the limits of an individual life or experience? 
What he gifts us with in his life and work is another set of eyes, multiple bodies, psyches, 
desiring into and through the deepest subterranean veins of feeling.
                                           Following his paths through myth, memory, language, sex, affect, 
something new always coloring into our vision. Critique, comics, Çiron, camp; Fiedler, 
Foucault, foreskins and Yoni rings, fucking; Aptor, aporia; newels and stairwells, 
Neveryóna; genius, the Georgia utopia of the Dump, generosity.

John Keene, “In the Rhizome” (detail).Sarsaparilla: a Calypso
 for Ivor Indyk

Fifty years past, for a fact,
on some semi-rural tract,
lived a man whose prayers asked, “Boss,
what on earth can follow Voss?”
Question answered, thus he wrote
(as my ballad shall denote)
in his hardly elfin grot:
Riders in the Chariot.
 
Riders in the Chariot,
ev’ry page a new bon mot,
“t”s to cross and “i”s to dot,
Riders in the Chariot.
 
Through market gardens, orchards, hives,
kids would ask on Sunday drives:
“Who’s that curmudgeon in our sight?”
Dad would answer “Mr. White.
Son of the squattocracy,
he breeds dogs with Man-oly.
(Two grown men in double cot
dreaming of their chariot.)”
 
 
So either side of Showground Road
Patrick mined his mother lode:
Brick veneers throughout the land/
Yahweh in a grain of sand.
No pink elephants or snakes,
His were visions like William Blake’s.
What he saw was what we got:
Riders in the Chariot.
 
Assailed by egos and by ids,
asthma, A.D. Hope and midst
encroaching avenues and streets,
see him back outcast elites.
Civic fathers earn rebuke,
Rose Bay matrons make him puke;
this pitiless dun-colored lot
won’t see any chariot.
 
Lest we forget, come Eastertide,
Himmelfarb gets crucified.
Isn’t that the way it was
mateship-style in fifties Oz?
Abos, poofters, refugees,
there’s a limit if you please …
What a copy book to blot,
they no ride our chariot!
 
 
On through Menzies’ days and Holt’s,
Patrick logged up minor faults:
countless friendships never stick
(what a temperamental prick!).
Laboured syntax? Let it pass.
Can’t quite “get” the working class.
Down at the dump though, smoking pot …
Riders in the Chariot!
 
What the fury? What the fuss?
Poor man’s not quite one of us,
till he tops that Nobel poll
(one year after Heinrich Böll).
Now a nation in his debt,
and with all the world to jet:
Pan Am? Qantas? Aeroflot?
He’ll stick to his chariot.
 
Forty plus years down the track,
stretched on Johnny Jackboot’s rack,
with ev’ry reborn Philistine
tuned to Seven, Ten and Nine,
lapping up each dumbed-down stunt,
through it all we still confront
Australia’s God Almighty What?
Riders in the Chariot.
 
Riders in the Chariot,
ev’ry page a new bon mot,
“t”s to cross and “i”s to dot,
Riders in the Chariot.

Fingers
fingers i stroke you look
i gasp, tingle
i want, i want, i want
i fear, you don’t
i look, you smile
you kiss, i melt
you kiss, stroke scars on scars
you kiss, stroke skin
you kiss, stroke ears
you kiss, hold close
your kiss, inside
me
your love
i want, i want, i wantLove is Ever So Lovely
She is loath to but still she comes
down the ladder saying
love
Saying this pleases her lips
and other lips are pleased as well,
smoothing the progress of a
kiss:
a bit of wire deftly wormed into a
small but lively keyhole. Which in turn leaves the door ajar
for a break in
0 becomes ∞, and even though there’s still a distance
even though she’s not yet fully willing, still
she uses it to hollow out a hole, to lay, as it were, a land-
mine
Doing this she pleases her hands
and other hands are grateful
which thus enables an
embrace:
doubled pairs of coupling serpents coiling up
as if to bathe in the air
Sharing this bath, they blow a 0 into ∞
steadily
evenly
and so
double
their capacity to bear this
display
so pleasing to the eye

 
 I shall never be lonely again, because of the love that dwells
      within poetry’s mouth
Music gives the transmitters a workout
which, once coaxed, no filters fit.
This song is an old misfortune.
I have spent my life trying
to stay out of my own way
I was caught by a tremor of strings
mingled with traffic
 
Work ethic notwithstanding
I ripen in your hands
the fruit of labor’s love.
 
What sieves through consciousness
dances in a borderless zone
between first and second natures
humbling the proclamations of  State
 
I will not be your lamb tonight
who ladles the moon another broadcast
there are 3 sides to every coin
and who are angels to the eye transfixed
are alchemized and otherwise melted down to earth 
      where I first learned
Silence is my Mother Tongue
and Song my Second Language.Suite from Final Theory
 
“… in this language there is nothing weird about the histories of physical systems.” (Steven Weinberg, “The Universes We Still Don’t Know”)

Understudy/starring 
 
At dawn, the mess of trees produced stars.
The radio news gave thanks for another — found the week before, 300 times our sun.  
They said it could be hauled closer, to understudy our panting source.  In classrooms 
children drew the procedure, of colossal ropes and lake-sized mirrors.
 
As morning dropped
the stars forced through the leaves, joining together
inhaling space. 
                              Once during a Roy Anderson film I saw celluloid burn that way.
                              First, the sound departed and the room went still; then, the shimmering
                              rocking screen like heated oil; before a dark pupil burst the scene and 
                              grew.

                                                                                                             They stopped the moon.
After the tide, paddocks were styrofoam pinned with spines of radiata; odd stumps, 
caked with gold to bring their detail up on tourist film.  Without its flow the coast 
halted, and let them hold the soil together a little longer.  We all lost that sinking 
feeling. 
Over the curve rolled the rhythms of jets.
From the passenger windows,
the unmoved detritus of the old harbours, and a soft floodlit earth.

There are only layers, stuck through with time’s arrow like a Valentine.
Its splinters sinking
distant resolutions
to return
shear
to the water,
cumulus sponge

Through, down to the drift valley
of twisted, scissored glass
its grains itch

White speed, sleepless piff.
We woke to cars
churning the road
from mountain to sea.

The Dependency
 
The sea bloomed under 3 million tones of desert dust — its low bed drove
right off the coast             onto the waves, seeding itself.
 
The sea will come back to us, if we can wait.  Don’t die, you say.
I shrug, Okay.  I’ll wait until the desert breeds tides; your camera might sink
but we’ll be the negative itself, the holotype.
 
*
 
As the peak dragged away, a few strands of hair
clung to its back
crackling the radio to dust.
The wires traversing its wake zone
so strong at first
cut into gradual forgetting.
They gestured to a final perspective
 
End-point was only an idea, though, which dissolved
the sharpening arrival of the distant
ranging sheet of light.
 
*
 
We took the desert road.
Reluctantly handing up its palms of fire, the plain of hard blonde grass
for the purposes of (light) was white and black, on black.
                                                       The road slunk.  Movements on the tar
wormed their way brightly to the other side, seeking a spot beyond the dislodged 
crust.  We crossed a few
facing the peak
on their chests, eyes downcast against the red.
 
*
 
Raw trajectory rendered imagination redundant; the speculative line had no place.  
That new space was dense with actuality.  Its absurd dimensions became acceptable; 
for instance, everything was middle ground.
Distance arrived from above and stayed until cloud locked us in.
 
*
I went into the centre of the cloud.
I waited.
The floor closed, held and closed.
It might have been a grinding cave.
The below-ahead.
Already the floor had opened.
I had given east and west.  I had parted into.
 
*
 
Clearing: one way, the scorched basin, the spring
after the catastrophe; another, woundedness, its open-ended reasons
making disaster run.
 
Filling: both islands are paths.
Our images will ride                        once/now/then/there/oh.
A Personal History of A Clockwork Orange
 

(i)
 
In nineteen seventy-three,
the year I turned six,
I was taken to see my first
 
James Bond film, Live
and Let Die. Nervous
beforehand, I asked
 
my brother, five
years older than me,
if I would like it.
 
‘Yes, if you like violence,’
was his answer, or how
I remember it. ‘What’s violence?’
 
I asked him, looking
forward to the warm
dark of the cinema.
 
Earlier that year, Mad
magazine had run a parody
of A Clockwork Orange, in
 
which the audience are
made physically sick by
what they have witnessed.
 
My brother, who bought
Mad, would sometimes
let me read his magazines
 
for money. One day, whether
for money or not, I can’t
remember, I looked over
 
the parody, understanding
nothing, no doubt. Some years
later, I talked about the film —
 
still unseen — with my brother
and a friend of his. The friend,
eager as a toddler, sketched
 
out the rape scene for me,
or for himself, or for my
brother, noting the three
 
points of the woman’s red
jump suit that Alex cuts
when he is about to rape her:
 
left tit; right tit; cunt.
 
 

(ii)
 
In the early nineteen eighties —
my Bowie years — the soundtrack
to A Clockwork Orange made
 
its way around my circle of friends,
briefly turning one into a Beethoven
fan. The soundtrack, released in
 
nineteen seventy-two, was by Wendy
Carlos, who gained fame for Switched-
On Bach in nineteen sixty-eight when
 
still Walter Carlos. Her synthesised classics
sounded queasy to me, so I preferred
Bowie, unaware that his Ziggy Stardust
 
persona was a camp parody of
Alex and his Droogs (‘Ultraviolence
in Liberty fabric,’ as the man said).
 
Unaware, too, that Andy Warhol —
about whom Bowie had written
a song — had beaten him to it, buying
 
the rights to A Clockwork Orange
in the nineteen sixties, filming the
novel in black and white as Vinyl:
 
the homoerotic S-&-M re-education
of a juvenile delinquent, Victor,
who dances to ‘Nowhere to Run’
 
by Martha Reeves and the Vandellas.
 
(iii)
In nineteen eighty-two
I went to a screening of
A Clockwork Orange at the
 
Western Australian Institute
of Technology, with its brutalist
architecture and engineering
 
students. The night was cold.
The film had an R rating, so
I was under-aged, though
 
no-one cared. I was with friends
who believed that only Federal
police could make an arrest on
 
a university campus. They were
all stoned. The audience was
almost entirely young men.
 
They laughed through the film’s
first fifteen minutes: a homeless
man being attacked, two gangs
 
beating one another up,
and the gang-rape of a woman
inside a house called ‘HOME.’
 
I was fifteen years of age, the
same age as Alex. I had finally
seen the film. All the laughter
 
confused me, made me
feel picked on. What had
something wrong with it:
 
me, the film, or the audience?

(iv)
In two thousand and five
I saw A Clockwork Orange
for the last time, with the poet
 
Maria Takolander. The previous
year we had married. We had
bought a Magnavox DVD player
 
for sixty-nine dollars and we
were working through the
films of Stanley Kubrick
 
in our usual way, methodical
or obsessive. Maria did not
like A Clockwork Orange.
 
It made her feel ill, as predicted
by Mad magazine the year
she was born. We talked it
 
over in the uncanny night, our
house suddenly over-lit and alien,
and then we went to bed. Our
 
shared sleep — free from history’s
horror, the mistakes of childhood,
and the turmoil of others —
 
a blessing in the moon-coloured night.The World
The world is not outside, it’s here
In these trailers where every hour of the day
War and terror, love and laughter
Heroes and demons, celebrities and children
Flying or floating through
Prehistory or futurity
Pass before our eyes like ghostly visions
Myopic and heavy with sleep
The world is here
Inside this endless spectacle of
Formulaic teasers
No need to even buy a ticket
You can stand here and watch them for hours
And in every single one they all speak English

 The Whole Creation
for Harold Bloom
I still believe in it, though I don’t know who else does.
I first experienced it in the building I have an office in now
And called it poetry, but the word was just a placeholder
For something undefined, though that’s too simple a way to put it.
You aspire to what you admire, whether you understand it
Or not, and now that I’ve retired into it, I want to remain here
In my home away from home, roaming without sadness
Through the whole creation, through the long song of myself.
Some days I wake up in a room suffused with sunlight
“Like a yellow jelly bean,” as Jimmy Schuyler put it
In his great poem “Hymn to Life,” but it’s not that kind of day.
There was a blizzard overnight, and everything’s shut down,
Including my seminar, and so instead of ruminating on that poem
I’m fooling around with this one, and looking out the window at the snow.
What is poetry anyway? It falls like snow, and settles where it falls,
And melts. I thought I was going to wake up in another world,
And so I have, but it’s the one where I began. The sunlight
Just came back, as what begins in gladness and uncertainty matures
Into a kind of baffled happiness, unfinished and complete.
I have the sense of something constantly receding, the way
The future does, then suddenly returning, like the past.
It’s all so confusing, and yet it doesn’t bother me —
Everything evaporates, but some of it eventually comes back
In the uncertain form it assumed in the first place —
A remnant still intact and seemingly as distant from me
As the books in the library I keep remembering and looking up,The Anaglyph
Hasn’t the charisma leaked away from the café crowd, and that other
Authority, the Salon des Refusés? I have forgotten much of
That old sack of enthusiasms and snake-oil recipes, the way
You have forgotten your own childhood, since
You woke up just in time to watch the adults disappear
From the world they had bequeathed us. It seems the scenery all around
Is hilly and unfarmable. Being brilliant has been reckoned
Into a procedure by some old guy, with a motto that is
More fitness, less flab. I hanker to go back to the land.
This means ruin to the culture-watchers. But the basic
Principle of my ambition is to be one excessively distracted
Entity at the mercy of the lurid, blurred and half-perceived
Motions of the Martians at the Halloween Hop. Fake? They sure are.
Summer is called Humidor here, the month of damp draughts.
The tale of my attempt to farm stubborn soil leaked from
Untruth to legend, my unlikely phase of boy-scout honesty being
Before I came to the big city. Here behind the tiny horological waterfall
Drums amplify the fun, but only at nightfall, then just for a moment
Of horrible error as I clutch the wrong person’s hand. That was true,
Only I said it wrong. Ugh. Now watch my serpentine
Gesture as I withdraw my hand, only to replace it with a congruent
Message that attempts to excuse this tactless fact,
Tearing at the sky over Twenty-second Street, but
The sky leans nonchalantly against the coop — I mean “co-op” — about
As graceful as a cowboy leaning on a chicken co-op — I mean “coop” — who either[1]
Has an anger management problem or is under the influence of a form of
Some anxiety that eats at him. I’m not the fly-away
Marrying kind, nor a grumpy bachelor with a broken heart whose pieces
Are seen scattered over the range. That begs for an independent
Yet symbolic judgment from the Judge now alighting from the caboose, whose arrival
Whether timely, to the tick of a caesium atom, or tardy, has to be
Seen to be believed, like
The face of a hunter in the dim mirror killing a bear. As
Nostrils give away suppressed anger by flaring, so an argument
That is over leaves traces — nervous twitch, grimace. It
Is impossible to hide my feelings, I guess. Look ahead,
That effervescent persona and its emotional lurches and rocketings
Affected so much, and its magnum opus that was called
By another name is now the old school-teacher’s chief creed and belief,
Or something very like it, gleaming in the rain. Hold up that light.
Has it shone on the tenebrous backyards yet? Or yet admitted that
It is unable to illuminate the wasteland of wet barbecues, so much
Of its fuel has flared and lit up the landscape … this project, I admit that
It is like gutting then refurbishing a friend’s apartment. Now, are
The reply and the echo done with? I asked a redundant question, and
That answer suffocated it, as a firmly pressed pillow
Has choked a banker, but no one knows whodunnit. That whole thing
Of returning to my sources, raking through my prototypes until
The last blueprint is found and seems just right: perhaps this is
Peace — a crowded peace — under the hot sun.
That we are afraid of it — inhabiting a reputation, the whole thing
About establishing who you genuinely were — are — I’ll admit. There
You hope your opus will be taken for legerdemain, but your effort sinks
Deeper into the mulch of history, while I adjust the mask that
Just fits more loosely every decade, and then I add up the little
That memory leaves me, a kind of pittance, the totality
Mustered and gathered … a look of boredom in a young person’s eyes,
And all those hopes and struggles are quite lost.
Accents and dialects distort them, once again.
To have escaped from a tangle of difficulties, from
Nothing but obstructions, into a glowing absence
And then to take a deep breath and plunge into
Those crowded riverine cities, greedy for contact with ghosts that are
Precisely what we want them to be, our plans furthered,
Seeing alphabet soup spell out the aleatory message and the time,
Casting caution to the winds and the weather — sorry, welter
Of neighbors, barking dogs, traffic cops in a dreadful confusion.
And permit me … no, commit me, please, while the cops are standing
Around chewing the fat, and pray that these
Moments miss you like a whistling arrow. Thunk! The old tapir tapered
Into the bar: a Scotsman, an Italian, and a capybara — I’ve heard it. But
Wasn’t the story of an Eskimo inside an eviscerated bear like this?
The fact that he “inhabited’ the smelly bear-skin … I feel that
Neither brave feats nor stories about them can cut it.
Did not a Dandy Dinmont yap? I deliberately stayed
This way, spiritually a hunchback, drooling and gaping at the stars
That promised ashes and diamonds and nourishing food all the way,
As though clambering inside an animal was simply the reverse
Of some method of becoming notorious. My cheating heart is known
Once its modus operandi is — among the cognoscenti — firmly established.
The look of a man is the man, Buffon said, and style a condition
Of those whose reputation is a handbag and whose blindness
Was being talked about even in Paris: a troubling myopia, so
That their left and right perceptual fields, red and green, slowly separated,
Only to hitch up again, like inspiration and perspiration. Go on, shout
And be heard. Is this anaglyph what I really want? My declamatory
Nature was made to seem just a yokel act. I must admit it is
Not without a certain eau-de-cologne charm, insinuated the farmer. And yet
An invisible dread prevents me making love to you among the previsions,
Then the post-visions that afflict me arrive, fits of
The assurance Baron Corvo had an excess of, a crowing assurance[2]
Which tainted his career, under the blasts of air conditioning,
Whatever. There on the bank statement
At the beginning of the Age of Façadism was a catalogue of waste.
A dumb waiter brought me the tablets and a note about the projected
After-effects: they may amplify the symptoms instead of curing them,
Though Frederick Rolfe was never cured. This
Emptiness will do fine. Just pop it in a doggy bag, thanks. Did you say “previsions”?
Was that a mispronunciation? “Provisions,” maybe, held
Too close to the chest, a fake poker hand of fate. The fireworks, they
Ended with a fizzing Roman candle sound that frightened the guest who was
Intended to rescue Gertie McDowell from that dirty old man. It’s
Gesture that fills out the role, as water makes the weather.
It was stupid of me to harp on the sadness
Of that animal’s demise: I should forget about the feeling
Which resembles taxidermy at midnight on an empty highway.
A telescope brings us a soothing view of distant mountains
And all the mountain people. Who knows where they’re going?
Moving from crag to cave to avoid the night
There, which is really ghastly when it comes on.
Beside the darkness, each farmer carries his own personal
Landscape around inside his head, a “landscape” being
What surrounds your idea of yourself, it’s so
Honorably framed, but presented in a Potemkin-village spirit.[3]
There was a vast electrical disturbance just outside the walls.[4]
Each time it’s different, down through the centuries
For the sake of cultural improvements they repeat a dream that
Continually gives out a soft fluorescent glow, it was
Like standing on the prow of a moving ferry in the morning
With the spray bursting all around
And a feeling of nausea mixed with ecstasy washing over me. In a way
The whole experience was fake, except for the scale.
Really, what do Eskimos think of giants?
Not too much, I reckon. They say they like them.
A moment later they’re saying how needlessly big they are. But
Also they are likely to flatter them. A cloud of dust
Or whirling fragments resembling a mistral rises up ahead,
But no one understands it: the old verbal torrent
In new guise, transformed into a sheaf of falling leaves, which
Are gathered up, bound, and stuffed into a briefcase,
And it’s time for coffee and a Strega at Il Miglior Fabbro. When[5][6]
Acts of killing fill nightmares and movies, only the calm
Of this bibulous routine can bring surcease. Then the shreds
Of another adventure assemble: a tour of the old college premises
Undertaken to the tune of the jig “From Rochester he came hence,
A writ of Cease and Desist clenched in his teeth.” Here, see this,
Like a pistol on a silver platter, it’s all yours
And it was mine once. Take it, go on. I kept it because
It had been handed down, and I had hoped it might be my insurance
Against the waves of devoted fans inefficiently
Seeking to take over the social scene and then the whole world.
The round platter, alas, has always been covered with dust,
So small it can hardly hold the pearl-handled revolver reclining on it.[7]
Thereafter it should be passed on to other worthies, noted by
The comfort of strangers they fail to offer you, or me, even.
Like the wily coyote, I’m no sleep-abed; I tried all
The most difficult forms, even threnodies ending with the words
“After all” or “Never mind!” And in my fine eye-rolling frenzy I almost
Exaggerated my métier into an obligation. This,
It seemed, was the way to build the future. But it was
Not likely to allow me to escape the whirligig of voracious time.[8]
After all, tempus fugit however we might chase it. Indeed,
All kinds of regret sprinkled my breakfast as the slant angle of
The day lit up the diner and the light began to increase
So that I was dazzled, then I heard a loud thump, dull, heavy,
Like a polar bear falling over, and the hunter saying something
Not quite obscene, but close enough. Criminy! The way
Things fade away, le temps perdu seems to be the point
Of this rodomontade. Does a traditional verse form simply provide
A protected place for the poet to plead the case for his vital
Concern for la vie littéraire, or is it a carapace, a palace?
And you can meditate there all summer long.
It was a little insight I had, one of the world’s smallest.
Distant requests annoy me. The Poetry Club may be ultra-sensitive
But its supine and self-serving acquiescence
To the demands of those creeps … okay, that’s in the past
And it belongs there and I promised not to whine. But oh, how
The past haunts me, its vapid fashions, the rigmaroles … they wish
But also harangue, that’s why I resent them, the ones I talk with.
And in this way my paean to non-discovery
In brittle yet oracular verse persuades us, but nevertheless
The map you provided was helpful in leading us beyond
Madness to something better: squatting in Circe’s mansion. Only
You desire us to fail — just there, perhaps, where your verbal acts
Are sentinels warning us of the slow-moving, quiet
Invasion of middle America by pod people over many years.
Be quiet — hush! — they are nearby, whispering the poem itself
In a parody of oratory. I’ll explain more plainly: the map
Of the literary world is a pantomime, and its longueurs have become
Prolongations of our prevarications on bad weather days, and also
Fine days where things seem okay but are not, those dull events
We shall banish from the Ideal Republic. Who called? No, I am
Not speaking to that shit: he just wants to be
Opposite me at the literary lunch. He got some fame recently, only
To be thrust into obscurity soon, I hope. It seems broader,
The sum total, a canal reflecting its own anagram, but will it ever[9]
Become legible? Hidden behind a screen of rocks
And foliage, the creep quickly inhales the distant
Ether and faints, thank goodness, and what I own
I see before me shining like a dagger. Meanwhile
I am only me, a faithful shadow of my real self, and
Private doubts evaporate between the Spring and the Fall
And even this is seasonal, and I thank you
For being so patient, you could have made some other
Voluntary or involuntary gesture like sneezing to prove your
Maturity or you could have hung and dangled from the branches
Of a tree to attract my attention a step or two away from them.[10]
It intensifies my desire to know you, a gesture like that, to
Form an opinion of your feints, apparitions and mode of locomotion.
In this way I control the crowded avenue to the Palace of Fame, the one
Leading to a rowboat mounted in a park where I perch and think to[11]
Myself and then jot it down, being careful to leave a blank space
That is the secret indication of Mallarmé’s abyss, a.k.a. “The Unknown.”
Eating ragwort is morally better than gobbling a quail tagine; the difference
Can never be explained to the obtuse. At this distance
It seemed impossible to reach the reader, Valéry murmured, then said the phrase
“Over and over” to himself, again and again. Meanwhile
Infant mortality was declining as aspirin consumption increased. There was[12]
To be a meeting about aspirin and other drugs later that evening,
He was told. He read poems about killing large animals to keep awake
On the tepid waters of café society. Go to the meeting, don’t go, whatever.
“Whose centre wobbles must fail,” the Latin motto says, and having
The progression of the equinox too much in mind brings rain
As they form a phalanx of epigones, those who come after.
Why don’t they just get used to that? They can’t be equal
Without coming before, and that’s impossible. The cup of
Contentment will never touch their lips. Ministering
To stunted talents is my fate; each day I tread that lonesome trail alone
And return at nightfall bereft and grinding my teeth at
What they dish out: similes as appliqué aperçus. They
Might as well hand in embroidery. The Force, puissant yet invisible,
Still surrounds us. Yet there is also a Dark Force
Between the cruel mandates of history and them.
It is because the greatness of art is like a snobbish relative
That we shall never agree on a strategy, and
Entertainment washes over us, leaving us ethically incomplete.
Former East German border guards know too well that that
Closes off an awful lot of options. The Moment
Of Death is dallying on Ninth Avenue, as yet uncertain of[13]
Its intentions. I’ll just leaf through the paper until
You wake up. I’m not planning to go anywhere. You know, it
Wasn’t a small thing, to turn your back on Europe. The walls[14]
Are turning into their own murals. Please don’t speak
Of time within the hearing of that tiny hydraulic clock you
Invented, it can be self-centered and jealous, and has now
Grown furious. Deep within its complex innards a purple jewel
Exists as a blazon, rotating slowly, saying that this
Existence is temporary, that you may lodge and idle here
Only so long as you don’t irritate the gods. Someone’s
Purpose niggles at you. Then the sunbeams flood in at acute
Angles and frighten the other diners. I thought, then,
Of having whatever I wanted, but it seemed that a distant
Image of you chided me. My admiration is a test
Of how you might accept it: gracefully, or boorishly, or not.
You hesitate, don’t you? I hate that. Please accept this
Wooden gesture, and you’re right, the over-decorated representation
Returns whence it came, though it was easily said, and simply meant,
With nothing ulterior about it: a simple entendre. I’d like to alight
With you from the caboose on a hot dry day in a wonderful town. You
Must help the Judge measure the exact length of the shadow of
Your well-wrought urn in the center of the square — it is still intact;[15]
Appreciation gives it the shine and the shadow — but just now somebody
Is phoning to arrange for drinks — will you join me? — later this evening.
 
 
“The Anaglyph” initially resulted from a commission from the Toronto magazine The Modern Review to write an essay of any type on John Ashbery’s 1967 long poem   “Clepsydra.” In response Tranter took the first word or two and also the   last word or two of each line from John Ashbery’s poem, and wrote   material of my own to fill each line out.
A clepsydra is a water-driven clock, invented in Ancient Greece. An anaglyph is a drawn or photographic image, usually printed in red and   bluish-green ink, that, when viewed through spectacles containing one   bluish-green lens and one red lens, presents a three-dimensional image;   that is, an image consisting of two superimposed and   differently-colored views of the same scene.

Notes
1.  lines 23–25: the sky over Twenty-second Street, but / The sky leans   nonchalantly against the coop ― I mean “co-op” ― about / As graceful as a   cowboy leaning on a chicken co-op ― I mean “coop”] John Ashbery’s   apartment is in a building that bears a large sign advertising “COOPS”,   or cooperatively owned apartments. The vertical alignment of the word   “coops” does not allow for hyphens. See the note to “Ninth Avenue”   below.
2. Line 91: The  assurance Baron Corvo had an excess of, a crowing  assurance] The  eccentric writer Frederick Rolfe (1860–1913) adopted the  pseudonym  “Baron Corvo” (along with several others). The Corvidae are a family of birds including crows, ravens and jays; corvine: crow-like.

Line 114: presented in a Potemkin-Village spirit] Potemkin-Village, a   pretentiously showy or imposing façade intended to mask or divert   attention from an embarrassing or shabby fact or condition. 1935–40;   after Prince Potëmkin. “Catherine’s [the Great’s] tour of the south in   1787 was a triumph for Potëmkin, for he disguised all the weak points of   his administration ― hence the apocryphal tale of his erecting   artificial villages to be seen by the empress in passing” (Encyclopaedia Britannica Deluxe edition 2004 CD ROM).
4.   Line 115: a vast electrical disturbance] The phrase comes from an  early  line of John Ashbery’s: “My child, I love any vast electrical   disturbance” (Some Trees, Corinth, 20) and is used again in “Electrical Disturbance: A dramatic interlude.”
5. 131: coffee and a Strega] Strega (Italian: witch ) is a liqueur. In Frank O’Hara’s poem “The Day Lady Died”:
It is 12:20 in New York a Friday […]
 and for Mike I just stroll into the PARK LANE
 Liquor Store and ask for a bottle of Strega and
 then I go back where I came from to 6th Avenue […]
6.   Line 131: Il Miglior Fabbro] Not in fact a New York café, bar or   restaurant, though perhaps it should be. This phrase was T. S. Eliot’s   dedication of The Waste Land to Pound: “the better maker” or “the   finer craftsman,” which is what Dante calls Arnaut Danièl, an Occitan   troubadour of the twelfth century and the inventor of the difficult   sestina poem form, a favorite of Ashbery’s.
7.   Line 143: the pearl-handled revolver] A radio play device: a common   name for any clumsy explanatory dialogue. In an archetypal radio play,   to identify the villain to the radio audience, who are “blind,” and   where the type of gun the villain is holding is vital in identifying the   real murderer, typical dialogue ran thus: “Carruthers, you swine, put   down that pearl-handled revolver!”]
8. Line 151: Not likely to allow me to escape the whirligig of voracious time.] Shakespeare, Twelfth Night, act 5, scene 1:
Clown: … And thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges.
9.   Line 186: a canal reflecting its own anagram] Psychoanalytic   philosopher Jacques Lacan developed a theory of the “mirror stage” of   ego development. Reflections and mirrors are of course symbolic of the   central process this poem enacts. Canal is an anagram of Lacan, whose name appears in another mirror later in the thesis.
10. Line 197: a step or two away from them] Frank O’Hara again. His 1956 poem “A Step Away From Them” contains the lines:
It’s my lunch hour, so I go
 for a walk among the hum-colored
 cabs. […] First
 Bunny died, then John Latouche,
 then Jackson Pollock. But is the
 earth as full as life was full, of them? […]
 A glass of papaya juice
 and back to work. My heart is in my
 pocket, it is Poems by Pierre Reverdy.
11. Line 200: Leading to a rowboat mounted in a park] From John Forbes, “Monkey’s Pride”:
I’ll be employed on a rowing boat
 mounted in a park,
 the one the avenues lead to
 because society has elected me / to decorate
 its falling apart with a useless panache […]
12.   Line 208: Infant mortality was declining as aspirin consumption   increased.] Though the two trends are not directly related, each is a   product of scientific advances occurring over the same period:
In  1897, scientists at the drug and dye firm Bayer began investigating   acetylsalicylic acid as a less-irritating replacement for standard   common salicylate medicines. By 1899, Bayer had dubbed this drug   “Aspirin” and was selling it around the world. Aspirin’s popularity grew   over the first half of the twentieth century, spurred by its   effectiveness in the wake of Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, and aspirin’s   profitability led to fierce competition and the proliferation of   aspirin brands and products. (Wikipedia)
Starting  in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a precipitous  decline in  infant mortality was observed in the United States. Economic  growth,  improved nutrition, new sanitary measures, and advances in  knowledge  about infant care all contributed to this decline in infant  mortality.  (Kwang-SunLee, “Infant Mortality Decline in the Late 19th  and Early  20th Centuries: The Role of Market Milk,” Perspectives in Biology and Medicine 50, no. 4 [Autumn 2007]: 585–602)
13. Line 229: Ninth Avenue] John Ashbery’s New York apartment abuts Ninth Avenue. See the note to “Twenty-second Street,” above.
14.   Line 232: to turn your back on Europe] As a young man, John Ashbery   lived in Europe for a decade from 1955 to 1965 ― indeed, one of his   poems is titled “Europe,” though it is mainly about the eponymous Paris   metro stop and its neighborhood ― then returned to live in the United   States. “Clepsydra” was “one of the last poems Ashbery wrote while he   was in France. The poem was composed in the Spring of 1965 …” (Shoptaw,  83). The unusual number of French phrases and names in “The Anaglyph”   also suggest this French connection: Salon des Refusés, Buffon, Paris,   eau-de-cologne, la vie littéraire, longeurs, Mallarmé’s abyss, Valéry,   appliqué aperçus, puissant, les temps perdu, simple entendre.
15.   Line 251: Your well wrought urn] Ashbery’s oeuvre; the reference is to   both the noted critical study of poems by Donne, Wordsworth, Keats,  and  Eliot, The Well Wrought Urn by Cleanth Brooks, and to John  Keats’s poem “Ode on a Grecian Urn,” which ends: “Beauty is truth, truth   beauty. That is all ye know on Earth, and all ye need to know.”
 
 
 
General Notes
John Tranter and poet David Brooks introduced John  Ashbery’s reading at the University of Sydney in September 1992. (The  reading was held at 6:30 p.m. on Wednesday 16 September 1992 in Room  N395, Woolley Building, University of Sydney.) One of the poems Ashbery  read was the double sestina from his book Flow Chart. In his  preamble to the poem Ashbery revealed that his double sestina uses the  end-words of Algernon Charles Swinburne’s double sestina “The Complaint  of Lisa” (1870). Sestinas are of course based on a string of repeated  and rearranged end-words, not on rhyme or on any particular metrical  shape. Extend the idea to other kinds of poems, borrowing the last word  or two of each line, and you have the process or form that Tranter has  called “terminals.”
 
 He has written many poems in this mode, taking end-words from Matthew  Arnold, W. H. Auden, Barbara Guest, John Keats, Frank O’Hara, Banjo Paterson and others. The US poet, editor and critic Brian Henry has  studied and summarized this technique of Tranter’s in a paper published  in Antipodes magazine in 2004; his paper is reprinted on the Internet here.  Henry mentions and quotes from the Ashbery sestina. He looks at ten of  Tranter’s poems and discusses each different kind and example of  borrowing in detail. 
 
 Brian Henry says, inter alia:
With the sestina as a model, John Tranter has created a new form similar  to the sestina but far more flexible in its emphasis on end-words: the  terminal. Taking only the line endings from previously published poems,  the terminal can be any length, and the number of terminals possible in  the English language is limited only by the number of poems in the  English language. The form has infinite potential. Unrestricted to 39  lines as in the sestina, not limited to 14 or 19 rhyming lines as with  the sonnet and the villanelle, not expected to repeat itself like the  pantoum and the villanelle, and not tethered to any rhyme scheme or  syllable count like the ballad, terza rima, heroic couplet, alexandrine,  sapphics, or ottava rima, the terminal as a poetic form is vastly open  to possibility. […]
… the terminal raises various issues about poetic form, conservation,  usurpation, influence, and composition that no other form can raise.  Because Tranter overwrites ― and in the process simultaneously effaces  and preserves ― his source poem while retaining the anchoring points of  the source poem, his terminals are both conservative and destructive.  (Henry 32)

In one of her most frequently cited circumference poems, “The Poets  light but Lamps ―” (Poems 883), Dickinson describes the influence that  poets have on later readers as a kind of “vital Light” that ensures that  the poets’ “Circumference” will be preserved. Both of Ashbery’s  references to circumference reflect this Dickinsonian luminance,  explicitly linking an image of light to a spatial circumference  figure (2). In this way “Clepsydra” registers the dimension of  Dickinsonian circumference that suggests that the “vital Light” of a  prior poet continues to exist, even after she is dead, by lighting the  “Lamps” of later poets. (1998)
Tranter’s “response” to the poem was quite different. With Mr. Ashbery’s permission he set out to dismantle and rebuild it. 
 
 He took the last word of two of each line from “Clepsydra,” as with his  earlier experiments with “terminals,” and also the first word or two  from each line. Thus each line of Tranter’s reworked poem had its  beginning and ending given to him; his task was to replace the meat in  the sandwich, as it were. 
 
 So “The Anaglyph” is a reinvented, perhaps flawed, or perhaps improved,  version of that master poem, which is here reduced to the status of  ancestor, model, maquette, or template. 
 
 “The Anaglyph” is partly about its own process ― that is, the  deconstructing and reconstructing of a poem. It is also about Tranter’s  relationship as a developing poet with John Ashbery and with Ashbery’s  poetry. 
 
 The word “blazon” gives us a clue to one of the poem’s effects (“Deep  within its complex innards a purple jewel / Exists as a blazon, rotating  slowly … ” lines 236–7). In the essay on John Ashbery in his remarkable  study of forty-one US poets, Alone With America, Richard Howard points out that Ashbery often buries a small “blazon” in his poems, and quotes André Gide:
I like discovering in a work of art … transposed to the scale of the  characters, the very subject of that work … Thus in certain paintings … a  tiny dark convex mirror reflects the interior of the room where the  scene painted occurs … the comparison with that method in heraldry which  consists of putting a second blazon in the centre of the first, en abyme. (19–20)
That is, inside the poem is a reduced diagram of the poem itself, “a  tiny mirror for the plot, or maybe narrative,” as Tranter writes,  referring to just this device, in his poem “The Alphabet Murders,”  written over thirty years ago. The buried presence of Ashbery’s poem ―  that is, the line-beginnings and line-endings from it ― haunts “The  Anaglyph’ as a kind of fragmented and half-buried blazon. 
 
 The title of the poem itself, “The Anaglyph,” is embodied in some of the  poem’s “business,” for example in the line “their left and right  perceptual fields, red and green” (84). This hints at the anaglyph’s  dependence on binocular vision. An anaglyph is an image usually  drawn or printed in red and bluish-green ink that, when viewed through  spectacles containing one bluish-green lens and one red lens, presents a  three-dimensional image. As such, an anaglyph is a binary image  consisting of two superimposed and differently-colored views of the  same scene, each perceived from a slightly different viewpoint. 
 
 “The Anaglyph” is similar to Ashbery’s original poem “Clepsydra,” having  the same number of lines and the same line beginnings and line endings,  yet it has been written by a different author at a different time in a  different society, colored differently and seen from a slightly  different point of view, and one which has one more layer of knowledge  than the original. When Ashbery began work on “Clepsydra” in the 1960s,  nothing like it had existed before. When “The Anaglyph” was begun, its  progenitor had been modifying the ideal order of the literary landscape,  to use Eliot’s phrase, for three decades. “The existing monuments form  an ideal order among themselves, which is modified by the introduction  of the new (the really new) work of art among them.” (Eliot, Tradition, 47–48) “The Anaglyph” depends on the earlier poem, and perceives the world partly through and from that poem’s viewpoint. 
 
 On the first page Ashbery’s poem is displaced, codified and  rationalised. The title of Ashbery’s poem, “Clepsydra,” refers to an  ancient Greek water-clock, which appears disguised twice in “The  Anaglyph”:
Here behind the tiny horological waterfall
 Drums amplify the fun, but only at nightfall, then just for a moment
 Of horrible error as I clutch the wrong person’s hand. (17–19)
Later in the poem, “that tiny hydraulic clock” (234). 
 
 The mention of Proust’s great novel (“The way / Things fade away, les temps perdu seems to be the point / Of this rodomontade” 157–9) reminds us that the  scents and flavors of his remembered life soaked into Proust’s  writing. Over many years these changed from private, evanescent memories  into private handwriting fixed on paper, then to corrected proofs, the  text of which was reified into public print, and eventually entirely  replaced Proust’s own actual life, as this poem seeks to replace its  progenitor. 
 
 Favorite themes of Ashbery’s are also glancingly referred to: old  schoolteachers, for example (“the old school-teacher’s chief act of  belief” 39) and his use of ornate words harvested from the dictionary:  “Those crowded riverine cities” (63) reminds us of Ashbery’s title  “Those Lacustrine Cities” ― that is, cities built beside or on a lake.  The phrase “ashes and diamonds and nourishing food” (77) obliquely  refers to the title of the 1958 Polish movie Ashes and Diamonds directed by Andrzej Wajda, based on the novel by Jerzy Andrzejewski.  Ashbery had the nickname “Ashes” bestowed on him in that decade by his  poet friends Kenneth Koch and Frank O’Hara. In the movie, a poem by the  nineteenth-century Polish poet Cyprian Norwid is quoted:
So often, are you as a blazing torch with flames
 of burning rags falling about you flaming,
 you know not if flames bring freedom or death.
 Consuming all that you must cherish
 if ashes only will be left, and want Chaos and tempest
 Or will the ashes hold the glory of a star-like diamond
 The Morning Star of everlasting triumph.

Ashbery himself, as the maimed father-figure, makes a brief appearance  to protest what has happened to his poem: “From Rochester he came hence,  / A writ of Cease and Desist clenched in his teeth” (135–6). Ashbery  was born in Rochester, New York State, in 1927.

Speaking of father-figures, the distancing yet ligaturing effect “The  Anaglyph” seeks to enact between Tranter the translator and Ashbery the  originator is addressed by Lacan:
Rather, the subject would now find him­self alienated in a symbolic  system which he shares with others. That system structures the human  uncon­scious, and communication with the other can now be enacted  through the shifting positions of signifiers in a system of symbolic  exchange. The self is still an ap­propriated self, but what is  appropriated is language as the other, and not an ideal but alienated  image of an individual self. (In the resolution of the Oedipus complex,  this would involve moving from a specular rivalry with the father, in  which the child seeks to take the father’s place, to an assumption of  the function of the father and, most fundamentally, of the symbolic  father who, as Law, is that which makes possible all symbolic  operations.) (Bersani, summarising Lacan, 115–16)
One final function of the poetic father is to license the son to take  his place. It is worth noting that Tranter has stated that he asked  Ashbery’s permission before embarking on this disfigurative exercise: 
 
 After wrestling with [“Clepsydra”] for a while, I felt that it needed  demolishing and rebuilding, and ― with Mr. Ashbery’s permission ― that is  what I did. (Feints 29) 
 
 Perhaps to empower Ashbery as the lawgiver, other elder poets are  downgraded. The most common thematic reference in “The Anaglyph” is a  series of references to bear hunting, the first of which is “a hunter in  the dim mirror killing a bear” (33). Poet Galway Kinnell was born in  the same year as John Ashbery, and also lives in New York City. Daniel  Schenker says
In one of his [Kinnell’s] best known poems, “The Bear,” an Eskimo hunter  stalks a polar bear who eventually succumbs to the sharpened bone  coiled in the hunter’s bait. When the hunter comes upon the bear’s  carcass he eats voraciously of the animal’s flesh as we would expect.  But instead of then abandoning the carcass or considering its other  uses, the hunter climbs into the body and life and death of the bear.  The object of the hunt thus becomes not the mere domination of the bear  by the hunter, but an effort to acquire an understanding of what it’s  like to be something other than oneself. As if to validate his attempt  to identify with the other, the hunter is granted a vision of spring at  the end of the poem as geese come trailing up the flyway and a mother  bear tends to a litter of new-born cubs.

And then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind and O! then the Roman  candle burst and it was like a sigh of O! and everyone cried O! O! in  raptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and  they shed and ah! they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden, O  so lively! O so soft, sweet, soft! (Joyce, 477)

“The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live,  mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time,  the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn  like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the  stars and in the middle you see the blue centerlight pop and everybody  goes ‘Awww!’” (Kerouac, 8)[Tossed] off all the champagne punch on
Gough St., come then past the last
high-on stretch dark the eyes
carry out of the street, high, turned-
 
on, down, almost crossed eyed
to this page, long prairie turned
white out of the snow and
winter come down on, the grass
 
underneath, as this texture, page
underneath, turns the nib
nap of, across.  I have walked
on off then in the long grass
 
out of the memory of my yard
into the pasture skirts, coats
the highway SW toward Pawnee
Station, trains long stand in
 
& the stations of the churches of
plains go on toward
only the sun
finally to know
to worship
in these endlessnesses

102 Today 

                           i.m. James Schuyler
If Wystan Auden were alive today
he’d be a small tangle of black lines
on a rumpled white bedsheet,
his little eyes looking up at you.
What did you bring?
Some yellow daffodils and green stems.
Or did they bring you?
 
Auden once said,
“Where the hell is Bobby?”
and we looked around,
but there was no Bobby there.
Ah, Auden, no Bobby for you.The Rabbit Woman of Honolulu
You a tourist? No, I work here. A college student? Good. Tourists are always photographing my rabbits. Now you’ve met the Rabbit Woman of Honolulu.
I’d broken my own taboo on photographing people without asking them first. She waved a finger at me. I apologized. I thought she’d tell me to fuck off. She had that right. It was like she had eyes in the back of her head when I was pressing the shutter.
We walked down Kapi’olani Boulevard.
Rabbit Woman –– or was it Rabbit Lady? My memory getting into mythic mode. But that’s her own name for herself, the name she said. (This is a poem, not a police report.)
Then she told me how the world was going to end when a black hole at the center of the earth would suck everything into it.
Like all media savvy, she knows how to deal with the media. She’s got the Press Release memorized.
Habla Español? Where are you from? You look Latino. My mother was an Arab, my father a Spanish aristocrat. I never knew his surname.
Do you have a number I can call you?
The world will end. But there is a solution –– a massive NOAH’S ARK a 1000 feet long and 300 feet high built out of Koah wood, the Hawaiian super timber that resists rot.
Read the bible, it was all in there. Make sure to seal the insides with waterproof tar. If I could get the students of the university to build it she would appreciate it a lot.
They were smart college students, and they could make it.
The hills of Manoa. She pointed to them. They’d be wiped out by a thousand foot Tsunami. But the ark would float above it all. I was heading there for lecture. I thought of turning back. Maybe she’d be right. Maybe she was the PROPHET.
The TV guys came and photographed me. I was on TV. She smiled.
I asked her if she lived in Kapi’olani Park. (Lived there, like a home I thought? A stupid question.) I move around she said. Why I asked. I get bored she said, and she didn’t hang around the library in McCully.
Too many crackheads. Then she told me about her rabbits. How a certain crackhead in McCully Park had taken one, stole it out of its kennel and cut its throat.
Then he burnt his mouth on a crack pipe. But the police had his number, and so did the Filipino Mafia. The bastard. The police had had it with him.
The police photographed the rabbit, the dead one.
“And that fucking rabbit-killer, he were gonna to die.”
 
 
Ala Moana
Ala Moana, a path to the sea.
Here is an island chain fringed with nostalgia
homegrown and the foreign.
The tourist vision from balconies of hotels
where you’d expect colonial ambience,
and you’d pay good money
for smooth transits to beauty and tradition,
where the waiter’s impeccable but his one rebel gesture
is a large punkish leather belt and buckle
he bought at Guess.
Otherwise here the food grows more locally,
like mostly all the staff,
and the lunchtime fashion models are twinned –– one a blond, the other
Polynesian –– one in a blue dress, the other in beige,
where the unique horizontal ceiling fans
survived the renovation.
Nostalgia is the voice of TheBus, the welcomeaboard
noneedtotakecareofyourbelongings bus.
Nostalgia. Each destination is the one you fondly remember
but not the one you know.
Nostalgia breaks out on the distant reef
where longboarders are sharing waves
in a civil way and remind you
of Duke Kahanamoku, and where
the Duke’s statue attracts smiling lovers.
This is nostalgic, not the love part,
but the statue’s permanent gesture of aloha,
made permanent in bronze,
festooned with lei and other gifts of pilgrims.
The very idea of a good wave left untaken, left to the gods,
gods who are not nostalgic but quarrelsome,
they are the pastpresentfutureforever
in this sky, this water, this every place.
When it rains it’s nostalgic, the double rainbows
in Manoa Valley, like the auto-art
spray canned on a surfer’s panel van
in a stoner’s village, my world in 1975.
What we called fuck trucks, way back then and they’re
collectable and nostalgic.
The mothers of Big Island, Hilo’s SUV driving kind,
dragging their kids and bags of organic vegetables.
Under the Banyan tree in Hawi, you’ll find nostalgia
but it’s real, as real as a cool piece of shade
where the pickup trucks unload chill boxes
of poi and pupu and food for the farmers market
and the locals catch up on the goss.
No doubt there are tensions but it was Sunday in Hawi
and it was “Eat Local Day” and everyone was
wearing their best.
Even the military are nostalgia’s guardians,
for what gives them a warm afterburn is
Patriot Day, and the launch of a new frigate
by a real war veteran who’d had his arm shot off
but still managed to take the machine gun nest
on a hill in Italy in 1945.
So I want to write 747 poems
and not worry. Whose home is it?
Whose nostalgia?
I can write 300 pages of drug related commerce
and abusive relationship break-ups,
this place that’s better not to argue with,
in case the present or the future makes me feel nervous,
(for that is my present).
Great writing, not nostalgia.
A union demo at the Hilton,
old style chants, placards that still mean we’re here, now,
echoing and unmaking my silences,
in-between ear-plug moments sliding shut
the plate-glass lanai door on a 40 storey condo.
Homeless, the homeless, are they nostalgic,
like the schizophrenic shouting into a public phone
with the passion of Armageddon with not
the slightest hint of irony?
Heard, seen, acknowledged, at least
when all the places that have really changed
are the places even old timers can’t remember.
You want to shout Fuck Tourism,
but that would be nostalgic.

 Card games
I was just about to take some liquid
nitrogen, because no problem
ever lurks in steam, when my dear neighbour says
let's play some nude card games. Steaming, of course
I said no. But there are cards and card games:
nothing dirty, nothing too out there. Just
hands and touching, here and there. Touching
the way we touch and go a mesmerising disaster.
Look at all the papers out there going for it. Swirling
around town. I knew some of them by name.
But let's play.
                            Forget the tear gas. The lilts. Shoves
and pushes. Touching we let the world stay solid. And
the world touches back, gently, lovingly, in lieu
of disasters.

For a year of my undergraduate degree I studied in Philadelphia and also spent time in New York, where I first encountered some of the work that has since become important to me — and in fact partly accounts for my recent move to Vancouver in the Pacific Northwest.
The poetry I love most — that I most want to write — is that which erupts from lived experience and is capable of spontaneity, ‘un-knowledge’ in freefall, happy accidents which show me ‘I’ am not who I thought ‘I’ was — and so allow me to step outside of myself. Alice Notley’s sonnets, H.D.’s Sea Garden, or Joseph Ceravolo’s Spring in this World of Poor Mutts offer a kind of expansion, play, pleasure in language that give way to a messiness and ecstasy sometimes lost in other modes of (dialectical, linear, or perhaps deliberately programmatic) thought.
Partly because feminism has been a prevalent discourse among North American (especially Canadian) poetry conversations, I’ve found the writing happening on the other side of the Atlantic to be a lifeline and springboard for my own work. To borrow a phrase from Rachel Blau DuPlessis, I don’t feel the need to ‘invent a new and total culture’ that a previous generation felt: in poetry that’s been done for me, by Lyn Hejinian, Joan Retallack, Susan Howe, and others. Perhaps the space those poets have cleared means there is no need to fall abjectly into the category of the ‘feminine other’ anymore (though I do think women poets in the UK continue to suffer from a lack of serious critical attention paid to their work relative to their male counterparts).
At the same time I’m stuck on how poetic language is constantly and ever more inventively appropriated by popular (digital) culture — how can I begin to write my love poem when Hipster Runoff and Vice magazine have already eaten it? The point is that I can begin, though. And there is so much North American poetry to turn to in thinking about this, especially recent work by Kevin Davies, Lisa Robertson, Catriona Strang, Brian Stefans, Stephen Collis, Cathy Wagner. “Give me hackneyed words because they are good,” says Robertson, and her books — especially The Men, Magenta Soul Whip, and Debbie — have helped me to see how I might disregard or circumvent the limits of the conventional or depleted lyric in my efforts to be sincere. Similarly, while Davies’s work enacts the malaise and social logic of late capitalism, it works through a funny, affective, and subtle irony that affirms the presence of an individual and collective conscience which is at once politicized and self-reflexive. I’m interested in the work these rhetorical affects can do, how the kinds of pleasure and sincerity — perhaps the excess — I want from poetry can be transformative, a form of affective politics.
 


In Case of Sleep
Sitting on a retro toilet that once belonged to Geena Davis
I stand for what I pee. A mighty maze speaks Olivia
through its annals & look! Her apology implodes.
I came to see you to tell you that the weather is finally listening
when your chest bleats into the cul-de-sac, but dining into the human
species and their revolving loopholes all I hear is your blood
and see it flooding out on a doubly romantic dream of mine which
the poets say is beautiful but is really glamorous and tiring.
Sleeping with my childhood wardrobe in a garden centre
responsibly and respectfully sharing my angst with the lobelia
I might recline like a cat but I wouldn’t sell my wares openly
I wouldn’t want to be that memory-cat with the power to die the power
to be put back on my feet I came to see you’d been eaten by tar sands
and cat didn’t exist                                 what kind of a country is this
what did you say                        I missed that
I miss that cat
 
 


Just Handcuff Me

Then paint me the sum of polygamy.
Tender brawny snippets, pear pips
& a drainpipe running down to the
sea. Not you not me.
With night you come stomping,
It’s kristallnacht in my dream —
why did you shave our heads?
When will we reinvent love?
Look at me orbiting the earth:
cool extreme organic oil.
I tower above the Shard wearing my
new raspberry jeans and orange t-shirt.
Some worlds still purr apart
a fly         or fact         or loaf
some people are just called bodies
but I’d rather die clean on the spot!
Some feel a baby kicking.
Asterisk nipples the real September
I began and where I started. With
shining intuition. Esoteric holler.
 
 


Hallucination
Pin on your hopeless dream
blu-ray flash bird            now I see devotion
mapping through a soft-top
then I am watching the blue leaf               
                                          turning blue.
Then I am Piccolo Mondo, killer of joy boys
and the third wave and I have been
a long time coming in the ovens.
The foothills are fleshing out, obituaries
are turning the corner of the street
to meet you dissipated and tuck the corner of
the sheet among your family maybe wash
your house down at dawn,
               maybe make a genius snowman
let it float towards the future             asking itself
what bloated life can be, turning
to the wall asking, what snow can be?
I have been a long time coming
The sun and the prince            go on and on,
pulling on each other, looking for a party,
caught with their tails on fire
or worse, fucking with a weaponless pigeon.
Now I see devotion pulling            and cover versions
cascading to the pit of the archive
where my hand is now, grubby Peyko-chic
Whatever drainage stinks down the wall
I will still,
Any flames can eat me up
You know —
Delinquency forgets its echo    Yea
Karaoke was always sung across two seas

Or why, in the Dalston CLR James
Library                             in the blonde ages
the enquiries could melt a man’s
heart, or touch him, make a fool of

we first knew the time                        I didn’t have
the cash on me, that was            when
Big fence            like might            you broke.
I thought you might be the shredded
water beneath my hair, my
Enlightened life. I thought the
steam room into Stevie Nicks’ head
Revolving on Stevie Nicks’ neck.
It’s not that I condone heraldry to get
close to death and colours
it’s that my feet are frequently misled
via Pontoon Dock            or West Silvertown
where I see an LED soul frazzle hanging
& chicken bones            rule the roost
where sometimes            it demeans us
               to where things leave us
and where we leave things
             alone, dancing on
the showboat, a glazed wooden brain.
What’s not great about this            is this:
in the soft fruit brain, what’s binary
and what’s not                         *poverty under the sun
*software that knows you            and the two
of us asleep on Pluto where, if a porn image
ever dumbs up,            hits itself in the eye
needs love               phobia of love or
    stickies,                I will be there to give it.
So bad I need money, I hire out benignity
I’m huh            your syndicat d’initiative

that Louise Labe would’ve made believe
              Not found goat in her bed
not sunk head-first            into woolly Caracas
called her mum to say             “call me.”
              It’s not that I want a showy title
I just want to believe I saw the arrows
Pointing to each hole in the sky
you’ve gone to buy me a birthday present
of voluminous capacity, I
know                        where things leave us blown across
the window            where the sound of train rolls
or at night wake up: to me, my favourite
time was in the street,                           junky cuss
but aside from this tenet what I see is
bands of poems: hairspray-encrusted plenary power
my self-pity bawling with the local yoga babies
that when I was too tepid was when my heart rubble
and my milk feet.
                           Somebody!

Confidence in Lack
Most recent modernist, and much subsequent, significant poetry writing has negotiated damage, in awe of a range of specialist vocabularies, used in the public sector by commerce, education, and the war machine. Throughout this period it has been evident that in spite of, or in deference to, the restricted and figurative use of language much that is public has involved catching a logic bus into an aspiration for coherence. One apprehension and understanding would be that poetry is at great variance to these expectations, both with regard to logic and coherence, and with regard to making vocabulary available and has led to a confidence in lack — a confidence that poetry, when it is at its most efficacious, cannot propose logic, as it is variously perpetuated in paternal and public thinking, and cannot aspire to coherence, as this is also prescribed. In particular, poetry needs to make these proposals or have these aspirations in a period following the extensive pollarding and retro-harnessing of modernism and its huge variety of materialist and fascist engines.
In February 2007, writing for Nature, an international weekly journal of science, a group of physicists, supported by the American army, Yale University and commerce, proposes to resolve the issue of photon number states in a superconducting circuit where they expect to distinguish between coherent and thermal fields (two apparently different orders of vocabulary) and create a photon statistics analyzer which will generate non-classical states of light and perform superconductivity quantum bit-photon conditional logic, the basis of a logic bus for a quantum computer.
The paper thus celebrates a dilemma. Poetry and engagement with a Public, like Science and its public, provide a significant mismatch, potentially involved with self-deception, or more often, active deceit. The premise for this mismatch derives from a range of incapacities and inabilities necessary to the frailties that underpin vulnerabilities and contribute to sensitive thinking; that contribute to the æsthetic and ethical basis for all written poetic and scientific practice. This is a necessary dilemma in conceptual and historical terms, set against the western proposals for logic and its modernist aspiration to cohere …

The International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium used a
hierarchical mapping and sequencing strategy to construct the
working draft of the human genome. This clone-based approach
involves generating an overlapping series of clones that covers the
entire genome. Each clone ‘fingerprinted’ on the basis of the pattern
of fragments generated by restriction enzyme digestion. Clones
selected ed for shotgun sequencing and the whole genome sequence
reconstructed by map-guided assembly of overlapping clone
sequences.
At the time of the pilot phase the sequencing efforts were renewed to
develop clone-based maps covering specific regions of the genome.
To construct these regional maps, we screened artificial chromosome
clones for sequence-tagged site markers,

fingerprinted the positive clones, integrated them into the existing
maps, and selected the largest, intact clones with minimal overlap for
sequencing.
In three years, to keep pace with the ramping up of the sequencing
effort, the ongoing efforts to construct the whole-genome bacterial
artificial chromosome map were increased approximately tenfold.
This map allowed the integration of a range of data, including
fluorescence in situ hybridization cytogenic clone localizations,
landmark data, obtained by polymerase chain reaction and hybridisa-
tion screening, clones from other libraries with associated map data,
and working draft and finished clone sequence and associated
electronic polymerase chain reaction landmarks.

Winging Step  
from Entanglement (1991–2003)
 
Initial engagement recorded risk in London commerce
a recognition of damage perhaps simply fragmentation
dimensions recorded in exhaust gas and tiredness
given shape in air moved
the narrative takes rein specifies location on a road
encounter with a second tarmacker
abrupted into syntax and narrative journey simultaneous with
natural phenomena juxtaposed rail tracks crabs of colour.
A following engagement named discipline and context
then specific quest and spacetime
linked back into initial risk and at a county boundary
traps and ideas of eternity or
the movement of a müller over glass
and in a garden focussed
followed by a return to the second engagement.
A new initiative locks in with specific semiotics
chains onto a shift of meaning
notes troat artificiality
and its natural semantic parallel
crossed with further record of damage
in rationalised details.
Again initiative clocks in as imaginative
memory of self in the image
trapped in London commerce
with a sense of helplessness.
 
A momentary sheen from complexity unfastens
relieves a pressure
undermines history
intertraced with added memory.
Rhetoric held in deluded appearance of natural images
the possible absence of representational tropes
superimposed orders, the riflemen cross the border
permits multiplication of represented object
implies a series riflemen cross the border.
An enveloping sheen, gossamer egg
a paranomasis braided to
mimesis and metaphor
a diachronic pattern of narrative discourse
usurped by radicals injected by machines
Another record of explosion or gun fire
as if randomly spotted
across a graph of moving trail lines
in a witness box, on a geiger check, by the self.
The Painter skate boards a range of chemistry boxes
posts a range of letters.
 
Tendency to perceive connected regions
uniform image properties
different from the neutron trap
luminance, colour, texture,
motion and disparity
stops responses
adapts, but retinal blood not
perceived sees what she expects
experience on the basis of edge information
lost focus, reception dependence
shape largely invariant over similarity transformations
underlie internal representation
conscious perception of texture segregation
requires attention
suggests expectation
as an important component of inattention’s blindness.
From the middle of the enclosure
clipped hedges and a fountain
air craft and sirens dependent
on personal meaningfulness of extra stimulus
a kind of attentional blink
perceived viewpoint remains
non-conscious process to the level
of memory.
 
The trapping region fills
with isotropically pure helium
in a cupronickel tube. A cold
beam passes through a series of
teflon windows, collimated
by a boron carbide ring, and
into the trapping region gets absorbed
by a beam stop. The trapping field
created by an assembly
of superconducting magnets continue to be
confined by quadruple racetrack constructions.
 
Switches from one object to another
incur additional cost
do not attribute to distance
a number of disconnected spatial regions
at the sametime attention split
among multiple objects
at different levels of her visual system.
A direct association cluster
printed colour word and sound of colour name
between colour itself and the naming
A logic of relation
between brain and consciousness
a supervenience in which conscious events
require corresponding neural activity
without relational structures she does not
experience different colours as more closely related
than shapes. Her expression of red
could be completely different from
the Burglar’s attention to corresponding
internal experiences that arise from
viewing the same modified plant forms
“We were up,” the mobile noted,
“l don’t study objects but the relations
between them.” The emergent complexed
neurons firing as low as 35 hertz
and as high as 75 correlate their
brain activity of visual consciousness.
 
More material than the Painter can possibly
cope with each moment she
visualises a recalcitrant fact
rises out of confrontation with this
to break it up and
make a further effort again
and again several until something
not in the surface looks
somehow in imaginative grasp
consciousness immersed in activity
that she may not wake up from
to reinvent herself enters
the room knowing she is away
in another country a different trap
attempts to keep innocence
to avoid dilution of the world
noticing what no one else has paid attention to
as surprising as a new species of lizard
incoherent experience caught in coherence
conveys new sensation of proportion or connection
early in the morning
incessant burning
200 sketches blazing in preparation
for anyone to warm from
integrated to its background
in revulsion for what she did before
a geometrical diagram
richness and sadness transformed into
subtlety and joy.

The light is leaving. The bay & the mountains 
behind it will soon be engulfed by darkness. 
It is warm, the water now, lapping at our feet. 
But what cities, what fires, do you mean? 

delicadas,
         green, tracing 
into, under, through 
beyond green 

                       fire, 
green consuming mountains 
corrosive, consuming 

it was green, she 
                   said 
        turning a pale hand 
 

Oh, the richness of it: 
the dark horse scampering 
through the sea-breaks, 
gulls crying overhead, 
the way she turned her head 
toward us, smiling her dark smile. 
A wave of her hand and she was off 
again, down the beach, turning 
and galloping back, smiling, 
smiling. And the animal beneath her, 
glistening and snorting, 
snorting and glistening. 
 

Trees opening, 
flowers with no eyes, 
a long dawning, morning words 
turn Barbara's way, hear 
mountains wish, 
                        blonde stranger 
conversation piece 
                            of the sun world 
 

Up the coast you know 
San Pedro and the rest 
of those small towns. 
Not much rain, but you 
could hear violins on hot 
summer evenings, surf 
curling toward the beach. 
And if you'd ever thought 
to leave your hotel room, 
walk the cooling sand, you'd 
have seen a kneeling girl 
picking out bits of red coral 
the last tide left among 
the seaweed and palm fronds 
at the water line. Hearing 
your step, she'd look up. 
Seeing you, the last light 
on your face, she would have 
smiled, though she did not know you. 
And, in the darkness closing in, her smile 
might have saved you. 
 

We are surrounded 
by the sea, the sea 
is all around us. 
We are ourselves 
in the circles of the sea, 
ourselves to the end 
of the curving sun and sea. 
Today is a windy day, 
we are so happy. 
We are ourselves in 
the circles, ourselves 
to the ends of the sea. 
No wind today, 
and we are happy. 
We are ourselves in 
the sand, the circling sun, 
the curling sea, the curving 
ends of what we barely see. 
 

from the shade, 
the shade of the brim 
             of his hat 
they move, 
a yellow car turning into a narrow street 
from the shade of a tree among trees 

turning into, 
what should we call it, 
this avenue of fading yellow trees 

it was not as though nothing had happened 
: there were his eyes, following us 
moving like leaves, through the chromatic forest 

***

& his women, moving in twos through the town, 
along the thin sidewalks, on their heavy legs 

& his daughters, with lighter hearts & heads, 
sitting, mornings, within his walled gardens 
as though nothing had happened 

***

& their green mountains, ringing the town, 
dreaming of yellow cars cruising the highways 
as they have for centuries 


Begin with an apology, 
some reason for not having written 
for seven months 
                          one month in a hospital, 
six in the mountains, convalescing 

       continue with something 
relatively unimportant, 
like the weather -- 

                         the dry air, 
     with brief showers in the afternoon, 
     the patterns of clouds on the hillside 

          the way the sun shines 
          through the broad, green banana leaves 

     tell her how those tiny lizards breathe, 
     those tiny balloons in their throats
Oh, God! The pain of it. 
Why haven't I seen you 
in all these weeks? 

What was it? 

I didn't mean to force myself on you, 
I thought you . . . I wanted . . . I . . .
Not that. 
No. 
I've never seen so brilliant a green 
as in those banana leaves with the sun behind them, 
the veins in them standing out 
like . . . 
                                         What was it? 
I thought everything was going well with us, 
that we wanted the same things for ourselves.

No, a letter like that it's better to write 
and throw away. 
                          Tell her about ugly things, 
those people we read about in the paper, 
the foaling mare, clubbing it to death, 
tying a rope to the foal, 
dragging it out, killing it
A strange mood. 
Nobody around now. 

I'm sitting on the veranda, wishing I had 
some cigarettes. Occasionally, I can bribe 
one of the chambermaids into buying some 
when she's in town. 

She smuggles them in past the doctors, the guards, 
sweet girl -- she returns my letters unopened 

The least she could do would be read them, 
don't you think?
Tell me something about yourself. 
What do you hope for? 
Do they beat you very often there? Is your condition 
incurable? Are they treating you well?

Things are very difficult here. 
The man in the next cell is out of his mind. 
He keeps writing imaginary letters 
to imaginary people, usually ex-wives 
or girlfriends. 
Because I'm a writer, he always asks me 
to help, check his spelling, etc. 
I think of you always, 
you and the children. 
They're beating the horses again. 
Down in the cellar. In the dark. 
I love you and miss you. 
Why don't you ever write? 
The sun is warm. 
It's been months now. 
Why don't you write? 


Among her belongings 
were found three pieces of coral, 
probably collected on her trip to Tahiti. 
A spider was living in one of the pieces of coral. 

She knew she was dying 
when they wheeled her into the terminal ward 

& she refused to admit visitors.
She knew she was dying the day she was born. 
Not an obsession, it was, with her, an acknowledged fact. 

But she seemed to be obsessed by nets. Nets & webs. Her talk 
and her writing were full of them. In her apartment, 
the cobwebs were never disturbed. 

The last time I visited her, she entrusted her diary 
to my keeping and told me where I could find it. 

This is one of the last entries, dated 8 August, 1965:
They are traps. I have always loved them, 
but they are traps. Since that day on the beach, 
the water placid behind the reef, I have known 
I would not be one of the ones who escaped 
or were thrown back. I would be hauled to the beach 
to do my flip-flop of death on the dry sand. 
Pray God that mine will be one of those that command 
the eye with their vigor and beauty.
She died in her sleep and was found in the morning. 
Someone said she was beautiful 
 

How much escapes us, in respect 
of ourselves moving with 
and away from each other. 
Carrying souvenirs, each 
to the other. Bits of dead skin 
beneath our nails. Loose hair 
on our shoulders. The tune of a song 
we've forgotten the words to. The words 
we can't remember how to sing. 
 

Under a black tree 
at the edge of the cliff 
something was turning 
the day to its good end 

and his worries 
left off where the water began, 
the edge of that world 
we most fear falling into. 

Among other things he heard her voice 
calling to him, singing for him 
behind him, among the dark trees -- 
the water shining before him. 
 

then someday someone 
will knock on 
your door, having 
walked for centuries 
to get where you are 

having been offered 
a chair, he will take 
off his coat 
and sit down, smiling 
though tired 

you will offer him a drink & he will refuse, politely 
there will be an uncomfortable silence, as though 
not knowing where to begin 

                                           at last, you will speak 
                                           you will clear your throat 
                                           & ask him where he has come from 
                                           but what you really want to know 
                                           is what he has come for 

                         & you've begun to suspect 
                         when he turns to you and says 
                         `Let's speak of that in the morning' 

and in the morning, of course, you rise to find 
that he has already left 

                                           and it is almost evening 
                                           before you begin 

                         to notice the difference 
 

This is what I believe: 

Below the visible surface of the world 
is an immense, brilliantly lighted room. 
Throughout the room are millions 
and millions of pictures, each 
a representation of the world upstairs. 

Mine would be a landscape with yellow birds, 
surrounded by fantastic vegetation. It would be night, 
and the birds would not be flying. There would be 
a moon. A full moon transfiguring the green 
and yellow jungle. 

Many complain that five of my six yellow birds 
are upside-down, and that the strange plant-life 
seems to be rooted in the sky. 

The truth, my friend, is that you, the viewer, 
are upside-down, and only one 
of my six yellow birds. 
 

Standing here at this upper window 
I see two men shouting at each other 
in the distance. The sun behind me 
flashes on a knife before me, and I see 
one fall, collapse and die, and hear 
what must have been a scream. 
 

Forever bringing us sorrow, 
coming across the smooth lake to us 
in a gray haze. 
                      Coming across the smooth 
water to us, across the waving grass. 

The voices of women reaching us 
through the smoke of their fires, 
the vapors rising from the surface of the lake. 

They are singing our death songs. They call us 
by our names. And the men there are sharpening knives 
and putting on armor. 

When they are ready to fight, and the singing has ended, 
disaster for us begins. 
 

Wondering if I would ever see you again 
I walked to the edge of town and sat down 
in the darkness wondering if I would ever 
hear the sound of your voice telling me 
that you loved me so much that you would 
do almost anything in the world for me 
except walk through that town in darkness 
and by yourself for the several moments 
it would take me to reach you to reach 
out to you in the darkness from where I was 
sitting all by myself at the edge of town 
wondering if I could ever touch you again. 

Outdistancing the others 
we came to a small, deserted island -- 

                   a curving beach of white sand, 
                   a fringe of palm trees heaving in the wind
We were depressed by the heavy smell of death in the air. 
I spent half of the night looking for you. You, traipsing 
around, the hem of your dress 
trailing in the water.
And from the air, 
drifting in on the trade winds, 
we see below us the giants 
hunched over beneath the clear, blue-green water. 

They are waiting, biding their time. 
Only the tops of their heads break the surface. 
 

I want those first words desperately trailing 
off through the underbrush, spattering light 
on the wall of my cave, mumbling along 
like her tiny feet in the carpeted hallway. 
I want our transitions as smooth as cream, 
elegant as our hands upon satin, clear 
as cold water running over polished stones, 
as a hand and a hand on a silken knee. 
Our lives should be no longer than our arms 
bearing arms through the soft, fleshy night, 
stretching, reaching out softly from our sides 
in cadenced light to a tentative ending. 
And the last two, like the first, in tandem, 
hand in hand, and screaming to the end. 
 

Wanting things to go on forever, 
yet craving the apocalypse. 
Reading the last few pages at one word a minute. 
Wanting to teeter forever at the brink of the abyss, 
and loving every minute of it. 

The solid single lashed over second. 
A shortstop's arm, just long enough to catch it. 
 

What we need 
is to examine this from as many 
viewpoints as possible 

There, for example, is an old woman pulling on her hose. 
She has rolled down the tops of them, pointed her toes into them, 
and begun to pull them up over her calves, her knees, her thighs. 
She smoothes them to her bulging flesh and then with a few tugs 
hitches them to her corset by means of the straps depending therefrom. 
She turns her back on a floor-length mirror, and twisting around as far 
as she can examines and adjusts the straightness of her seams. 

And then, in broad daylight, she turns and walks away. 
 

It's my fault. 
There are circles within circles within circles. 
They are like ripples on the surface 
of a perfectly round pond 
when a perfectly round pebble 
is dropped straight down into it 
precisely at its center. 

They just keep spreading, getting wider and wider, 
and even at the water's edge the impulse continues, 
diminishing with each successive ripple, 
but making themselves felt nonetheless 
as they go on spreading wider and wider, 
more and more minutely, world without end. 

I know it's my fault. But all those others 
only stand around in a circle, wringing their hands 
and crying. Tears springing to their round eyes, 
almost as though they were not enjoying themselves 
at my humiliation. They cry for all of us, they say, 
they cry for us all. They range in a circle around me. 
Their tongues are tiny dots in the circles of their mouths. 


Several times a day I go outside & peek at the sun. 
It is always the same: Between 8 & 4, just a bunch 
of colored disks -- red, yellow, green, blue -- popping out 
at you POP POP POP POP. Just like that. 

After four o'clock in the afternoon it always gets bigger 
& bigger and redder & redder, until, like the swollen 
nose of a wino, it slips below the bar. 

Sometimes at night I go outside and look at the moon, 
catching sunlight on the rebound as it were. But when 
the moon is full, on the far side of earth, I think 
of myself on the moon, watching the sun in the dark of the earth. 
 

Sea-swimming the mastertank 
the brainwaves spilling over us like something 
I would rather not talk about 
                                            her face 
though there was nothing particularly wrong or right 
with it did it seem unusual that she did not return 
with us that no one ever seemed to hear from her 
again. 
         It was the same old story It was his wife 
who wouldn't listen to him his protestations He 
spoke to her of love 
                               & every bit of her attention 
    went right out the window, whistling Dixie 

I should have thought that that would be enough to warn 
you. But, tell me, now that you know: 
Do you have any sincere regrets? 
 

Specialties of light. 
Among the mountains, voices to be heard. 
The clean air, to be seen, looked into. 

The campers in Dog Canyon were not surprised. 
Perpendicular walls shut out the sun. 
And yet -- the air was light, 
light & air, moving. 
                 The mountains themselves 
seemed to move with it, breathing. 

Moving air, carrying with it the smoke of campfires. 
In early morning, the smells of bacon and coffee, 
swirling through the trees. 
The trees themselves: aspen, pine, and spruce. 

Three hours of sun between the walls, an afternoon 
of drowsy breathing. Sweet smell of horses. 

After dark, distant sounds have an edge of fear. 
And the chill in the air smells like ice. 
Ice moving down the mountains again. 
Down from the top of the earth. 

Late, after midnight, between midnight & dawn, 
our eyes turn out into space. The frozen stars, 
suspended in nothingness. The one time of day 
we can see where we're going.

After Reading Tolstoi
They've poisoned my dogs.
It's come to that at last.
They stole away the horse
and then poisoned my dogs. Three dogs
I slept and ate and hunted with.
Under the moon, their silence howls around me.

It was Sten, the youngest and strongest,
who tore my heart. Took a full day in dying.
Lay there long, only his pain before his eyes.
The others were older -- one was his father --
not as strong. Gave in more willingly.

If I were young, this would have been different.
As a young man, I was a raider. Carried off
what I wanted, and none dared to stop me.
No man could kill my dogs and live.
And then this town, this miserable stone and rocky town,
begged me to live here, be its protector.

Poor job for a fighting man. The town attracts only scum.
But, just over prime, I worked hard for them,
kept their hands clear of blood and killing.
In their church they placed a handsome statue of me,
called me their seventh Knight of Heaven. God pity the others!
They built a house for me, built it strong of stone.
It keeps out wind and rain. They gave me Margareth
for a wife. Not rich, but beautiful and young,
and weak -- as passive as a drowned seagull
nudged along by each passing wave.
A young and beautiful wife.

Some sickness carried her off, and most of the town --
left me half-crippled, fighting off looters and raiders.
Finally then, nothing left worth fighting for. So I'd ride
and hunt with my dogs. Came more and more
to sitting still, listening to the passing rains.

The statue still stands in the church, though nobody
knows we were the same now. The dogs are gone,
and the horse. I've seen a young girl kneeling
before my statue, dreaming or praying. Are these the same?
Praying to, or for me? What difference could it make?
I sit in the house now. No dogs in the yard to give warning.

From miles away,
I see long columns of them, moving southward
through the snow. Turning aside
from my original purpose, I find
now that I no longer fear you.
I have collapsed my tent
and begun to move south, along
with the rest of them.
You are dead now,
and I no longer am full of fear.

It is warmer. The river is free of ice.
They remember us here, and have thrown up defenses.
Within the walls there is laughter and singing.
We are too hungry and tired to fight them.
Come spring, I will find you again. I will change your life.

The woods are dark and thick.
The trees are nailed to a black sky.
A mile back it was snowing in sunlight.
We're sleeping tonight beneath the Bishop's window.

In a house at the edge of the trees
they huddle on long winter nights, making things of leather.
Before bed, the farmer, on a stiff leg, walks to the door
and looks out. A patchy fog is forming in the lowlands,
drifting up across the meadows toward the trees.
He doesn't see us, but knows we are here -- down from the hills
and crazy with hunger. His traps lie half-hidden before us.

The nights there
were never unguarded.
The vaulting walls
leapt into shadows,
and in the shadows
there was dancing.

The light of the rose
in a blue glare. We
were dancing, were
dancing, were dancing.

Arising from her bed
she moved through uneven patterns
of sunlight on her floor.
She will continue to glide
through splashes of vivid color
until the voices and instruments
in the courtyard below
have grown silent.
Primary colors: greens, reds, and blues --
alternating, pulsating in wavering banners
on the walls, the ceiling of her room.
On her naked flesh.
A footstep on the gravel.
A whisper from the nearby trees.
She turns aside, stifling a sob.
A handful of flowers,
tossed through her window, falling
at her feet.
Mending a tear in her skirt
she listens for his arrival,
but she doesn't look up, not
even as he enters the room.
He looks at her and smiles.
She smiles without looking up.
It grows dark.
The first sounds of music come up
from below. There are flashes
of sheet lightning in the distance.
Silence. The smoke of a sweet-smelling wood
drifting through the open windows.
He touches her hand.
The smoothness of her hand.
Her studied composure.
Even now.
Please do not leave me.
Please do not go.
What would I do?
What would I do without you?
Without you there is nothing to do.
No one to turn to, to wait for.
I am a Pale smoke drifting through the trees.
The musicians have departed.
Only a slight breeze now,
pushing gently at the curtains.
A distant rush of water.
Go now.
There is no fire here.
Only smoke.
A view of the sea. Trees stirring
at the top of a cliff. Watching the sunset,
the wheeling, plunging pelicans,
we would talk about suicide, about throwing
ourselves down upon the rocks,
into the churning tide.

For minutes, or perhaps only seconds,
our blood would stain the rocks and sea.
The birds would descend like clumsy angels,
and when they arose we would rise with them,
our wings beating strongly, our voices good
only for screeching, eyes peeled for fish.

in darkness,
running over wet
pavement, soft
earth
washed onto
the road by
rain --
          easy
to make
a wrong turn
on these
winding roads
in the mountains,
to get
lost
on so little
an island

The lights flicker and grow dim.
Then with a crackle and tiny puff
of smoke they go out. And for the first
time in years we are left in darkness.
In town, headlights of cars sweep the streets,
corners of houses, but they will also
blink out soon. Clinica Font on the plaza
has its own power, but even there
they cannot hold out for long.
Nights settles more deeply over towns and cities
in the mountains. We still have candles
and the means of making fire. But now
we will not see so clearly after dark.
Our attackers will remain. Faceless,
dreaming shadows.

The house gives us shelter.
Its walls and roof protect us from the rain.
And from the sun. At these latitudes, we have no fear
of snow, and thus our roofs are flat.
Because our house rises above those of our neighbors,
we can look down on their roofs when it rains
and see that they are like square lakes,
holding the water until it has time to drain away,
or rise in steam into the sky from which it fell.
Many of our neighbors are adding second storeys
to their houses, so the days of square lakes
are numbered.

The houses are made of concrete blocks. Lumber
is expensive, coming from far-away places
like Nicaragua and Brazil. And then
all wood save the hardest (mahogany and such) is subject
to termites. Our house is old. We have cheap, wooden doors,
as thin as tissue. The debris of termites appears each morning
in tidy little piles beneath the doors. They leave their
trails on our walls and ceilings. This house is
their shelter too. It also provides them food.

O separations!
Internal organs are bleeding
The stuffing's coming out and passing among us
collecting oysters for the poor
This was never enough to sustain us  It stank
of garbage and was unrecognizable in any other
form hair in her eyes and her horn honking
The wind was whispering in her ears and her ears
so delightful to nip at, were pinkish
The wind was cold
O accidentals!
Delightful to stumble upon and there was an old
man who liked to look at her legs and look at
her legs and her legs

This is just me. These words,
I mean, they are only me. Nothing
to be afraid of, or to worry about.
We can travel, go where the stars go
when they're gone. Now you're in this too.
We're going somewhere, but we don't know
where. But it's nothing to be afraid of,
nothing to worry about. Now watch me.
Watch me carefully. I'm going to
disappear before your very eyes.
Don't be afraid. I'm gone now.
You're alone again. All by
yourself. What does it
feel like? Are you
afraid now?
Are you?

For a few days, I was traveling
in a strange country. The people there
were very poor -- fighting over scraps
of meat I would throw to them. Their language
was untranslatable into any other.

The sun sets early, leaving a red smear across the sky,
you look up in surprise --
                                       the olive trees stand like old women,
bent & shaken on the hillside --
you carry a load of branches & sticks, as though you were a beast of burden,
you wear black, as though always in mourning,
you travel this road every day.

We were speaking of
a random arrangement of figures,
most of them slender and dark-skinned,
standing, as though at work with rakes
and shovels, among several -- no, many --
yellowish-white pyramids of salt
stretching off into the near distance.

Atop one such pyramid
would stand a middle-aged woman
(or perhaps she would look older
than her true age) who would be wearing
a baggy blue dress, and a headband
to keep her long, black hair off her face.
A hundred pounds of salt strapped to her back.

Beyond the mountains
there are more mountains.
The road I thought I'd seen the end of
has turned another corner, vanished beyond
an outcropping of rock.

In the hot sun at noon
I meet a traveler going the other way.
He too is thirsty and without water.
He too has been walking all day.

We greet each other like old friends.
We abandon the highway. The mountains embrace us.
I saw you by a lake.
I thought it was you.

I thought it was a lake.
As I came nearer

the clear, blue lake remained,
and you vanished. I thought

it was you who vanished.
The lake was not a mirage.

Blue and clear it remained,
shimmering in the sun.

There was no sign of you
in the sun by that lake.

I walked into the lake
in despair, never thinking

to find you there, sleeping,
with the blue waters drawn

about you like a blanket,
sheltering you from the sky.
I know nothing of the airplanes
or the twisted spoons. The air was clean
when I arrived here three days ago.
And now?

Well, now I sell these things from door to door.
They're light and flexible and full of fun.
There are two models. The first is soft and pointed
at the end. The other is squarish and opaque.
Don't worry. We bear full responsibility for them.
Yours only to enjoy, and make small monthly payments.

There'd be one town and the next, and I'd go home again.
The door would be open and she'd be gone, as before.
Piles of unread newspapers, squeezed-out tubes of glue,
open jars of ointment, lying all around.
Sometimes I could figure when she'd come home
by the amount of underwear she'd left behind.

Looking east in the first light of morning, I'd see her face
rising above the city, a huge balloon covering half the sky.
Later, she stares at me from the west. Her bloated face destroyed.
All day long, I've moved and breathed in the staleness of her breath.
I was driving
east along the
highway to the south.
Traffic was light. A few cabs
and horse-drawn wagons. I whistled to myself.

Where three roads came together
there was a clog of traffic. People of all ranks,
milling about on foot. The sound of a siren.
Its melancholy rise and fall. Trailing off into the distance.
With my feet I scattered red and white bits of glass.

Upstairs later, in bed, we were still laughing
about the mistake she had made. Long ago.
she had taken me for someone else, and now at last
she was able to laugh about it.

I was reminded of the splendid sunsets of the south.
The modern highway curving past the beach. Sandcrabs scuttling
landward.
Land-side dark. Last trace of daylight, caught in the web of the sea.

It was a small parade. Four or five instruments
and a couple tattered banners. I watched them from the porch
of my hotel, as they straggled onto the public square.
The trumpeter wiping his lip on a dusty sleeve.

I walked out to the edge of town, knowing she would wait for me.
The stars there were exquisite. Cold and clear.
The few houses I passed were illuminated by candles,
the men and women in them just sitting down to their common meal.

She was sleeping. In the dimly-lit room she had fallen asleep waiting
for me. I touched the smooth skin of her belly. She moved
very slightly. Then her eyes opened wide and she recognized me.

Long lines of trucks moved overland from the coast.
The mountain roads were bent and twisted. The trucks
moved slowly and noisily, and I took great chances,
darting and weaving among them.

Beside the small roadside shacks there were many girls,
smiling and waving. Their teeth were bad, but otherwise
they were not unattractive. At open-air bars along the way,
the sweating drivers would gather, boast of their triumphs.
I myself would listen, and learn.

These days were windless. The skies all day, a heavy blue.
The sweet smell of carbon, hanging in the air.
The women tending their braziers, toothless and old.
Often she would come to me during the night.
She would appear at my door unannounced, wearing nothing,
or the flimsiest of shifts. And I would lift up a hand to her.
Nights of closeness, followed inevitably by
mornings of careful indifference. Her softnesses
deferring to my strength.

Great heaps of crated machinery at the docks. The beggars moving
among them, seeking out the careless, stray tourist. The statue
of the great explorer looking out to sea. The government offices
reeking of confusion and delay. The police, their rifles balanced
on their shoulders, fingers always on the triggers.

I sat on the porch, reading her mail. Interminable letters
from those who had once known her. Looking up from them
I could see thunderheads crowding up from behind the peaks.
Within an hour the storm would be upon us. Downhill avenues
would become tumultuous streams of muddy water, boiling up
at the wheels of cars and trunks of trees, moving inexorably down
to the lower parts of the city. The slums, the docks, the harbor.
Power would fail. And night would come on unopposed.

***

I raced east along the coast,
turned southward into the mountains, and began to climb.
My arm hung out the window. My fingers played with the wind.
The air became rapidly cooler, and soon I was high above the city.
As the road narrowed and steepened, I ascended more slowly.
Young boys ran beside me, trying to sell me bright
green little birds they carried in small wooden cages.

I spent the night in a small hotel in a decayed mining town
high on the face of a mountain. I ordered a modest evening meal.
From a nearby table, an old man smiled at me. I smiled and nodded
back. He cupped in his hands a small green bird. He smiled and cooed
at it. He smoothed and preened its feathers with his tongue, and with
one snap of his jaw took its head off. The head, and then its body,
went out the door. He smiled one smile, blood dribbling from his
mouth, and shuffled out into the night.

Next morning I went on, higher into the mountains. But the farther I
drove the more pointless it seemed to continue. I turned around and
headed down. For hours it seemed, I floated, drifted down toward
that hot white city, the citadel of her affections.
Bandits were hiding among the trees,
and across the river were only pig farmers
who wouldn't look up from the mud at their feet
if the sun itself fell hissing and steaming
into the river. The river could turn around
and flow backwards, uphill into the mountains,
and those thick-heads wouldn't notice.

The hooligans in the woods
could strip you and skin you alive,
they could rape your wife and skewer your children
on pointed sticks, and those clods across the river
would only be conscious of mud squishing between their toes.
Piss sloshing between their ears, the piss-heads.
Their own mothers could be carved into cutlets
and fried before their eyes, and they'd only shove
their greasy thumbs farther up in their noses.

One day it was necessary for me to cross the river,
and Black River Bridge was beyond the trees.
I bid farewell to my wailing wife and children,
and set out on the path with my life in my hands.

The sun was up. The river was flowing the right way.
And across the river the pig farmers were playing,
hitting each other with clubs and falling into the mud,
laughing and spitting out teeth. And someone was hiding
behind a tree at the comer of my eye. I tumbled down
when he tripped me, and he fell atop me, pinning me
down with his ax. He breathed in my face and showed me
his teeth. He had nice teeth, considering.

"I am Tasso, a poet," I gasped, hoping to win his heart.
He quickly sprang to his feet. "A poet!" he exclaimed.
"Well, that's different. I'd sooner steal pig-turds
from those boneheads across the river than take money from a poet."

He guaranteed me safe-conduct through the forest for life,
and once a month one of his band would leave a pig,
freshly slaughtered, at the door of my home. In return,
he asked only one thing -- to see, just once, his name
in writing. So here it is:

                      Benedetto Mangone,
                      who would not rob a Poet.
Abundantly green flowing river
water in many channels
southward flowing and warmly

green things squirming and wet
filtering sunlight slow but sure
and settling bottomward,
the others scurrying upward

out of the sludge, and feeling
their way toward the light blue
flow of morning weather.

***

Letting fall a light green veil,
the ramshackle air of a summer morning.
Her pillows are of yellow and white stripes.
Her eyes, a light green against them.
She's half awake. Her nose begins to itch.
From the tall weeds beyond the garden
a death is announced with heavy sweetness.

But breakfast on the Porch, an orange and toast,
is very reassuring. The gathering of flies
is not for me. Some leaves stay green forever.

***

Little shepherd on the windowsill, we smashed him with our fist.
We stamped his pieces into the carpet, crushed his eyes.
We catch fireflies in the garden after dark, tear their wings off,
put out their fires. The dog that died behind the barn,
we saw the hair and flesh melt off his bones each day,
the buzzing swarm of flies. We dropped his bones in the river,
watched them settle, one by one, into slimy green.
At thirteen
I was torn from my mother's arms
and sold into slavery among the Pennsylvanians.
In the years that followed -- those long, empty years --
my mother often wondered just why it was me,
why it was me who was chosen.

I'd always thought it was the fairness of my skin,
my delicate complexion. In all of New Jersey
there was no one as fair as me, I'd been told.
I always stayed out of the sun in New Jersey.
"Keep your skin white. That's all that we live for."

But here among the oil fields and coal mines
of Pennsylvania it is just the opposite.
They rip off my clothes and smear me with grease.
They powder me with coal dust. Their heavy breathing echoes
among the hills. They love me here. They just love me.
Up along the line
there was another
child there was
another way another
line of response

thought her smile
her smile was amazing
appealing

in other words
her blue eyes smiling

she came here one night
& stayed forever.
                                                     grasping one moment
                                          of clarity
I escaped --
                     over the wall
                                                     & into the woods
listening, not listening
                     to the laughter
                                          of my mother & father
            sunrise
                     allowed me
at last to see
                     myself clearly i was old
my hair had fallen out
                     i had no teeth
                                          my lips
                     were frozen to the windowpane
someone was screaming at me from the next room
             the wall there was higher than ever
      the woods near the house had been leveled
               and the children, the others
                     the children
             and the children of the children
were in church, praying for me to escape, once and for all.
Look around you.
See me
             everywhere.

The birds are my
messengers,
             my eyes
in the sky.

Touch
             a tree
& tickle me.

Lick an ice cream cone
& feel me melting

inside you.
Another summer
and again you will be flying downhill
on my handlebars, your hair
will be blowing in my face,
the taste of it will be in my mouth.

Another autumn
and rolling in leaves, my hands
will be itching to touch you.
And winter comes, and snow falls,
and we drag our sleds to the cemetery hill.
We try the hill behind your uncle's house
and stay at the bottom for hours.
And spring comes in with mud and rain,
and walking with you by the river.

Another summer
and again I will be flying downhill
on your handlebars, my hair
will be blowing in your face,
the taste of it will be in your mouth.
Late May, and still there are patches of snow here.
Long lines of sheep, crossing the highway like pilgrims.

High mountain roads are still closed in Wyoming.
The passes from one warm valley to another
are frozen tight with snow.

High in the mountains are corners of snow
the sun never reaches. Never.
It is a piece of land, both ample and secluded,
on the far side of town. To get there, you take
the first uphill street from the harbor
and follow it as far as it takes you.
There is an old church. You stay well to
the left of it. Further on, there is an old tree,
which you should keep on your right.
On moonless nights you will recognize it
by the strange glow hovering in the upper branches.
Beyond the tree is a field of ploughed ground,
steeply pitched on the highest part of the hill.
Dead Man's Field, it is called. No one in town
knows who ploughs it. Or what, if anything, is ever
harvested. My sister Eva knows. She surely does.
Not wanting to leave, exactly,
but having been told to get out of town before sundown,
he suddenly decided that it might be nice to take a trip.
His health had been poorly, and, you know, a change
of climate might do him good.
So he said goodbye and left town, taking
only the bare essentials, traveling light.
Towards morning, in loneliness and anger, he came upon
an isolated farmhouse, where lived a sad and beautiful widow,
who, in his rage, he would have raped and murdered
(or murdered and raped) had she not quickly found
her tired, broken heart could beat with love again.
When it finally occurred to me
that the road might have been
tampered with, I got down on
my hands and knees to examine
it closely. Though the night
was dark and moonless, I could
see that the surface was pitted
and scarred, that tiny fissures
sometimes extended from one edge
of the road to the other. The extent
of the damage dismayed me. Round Hill
now seemed far away, so very far away.
I thought at first
it was the wind.
The wind, I thought,
had broken up the light
along the chain of lakes.

The ground was more broken
the higher we climbed.
The light, more intermittent

Nothing moved. Nothing
touched me. I might
have been on the moon.

But you were there with me, weren't you?

***

Each lake was smaller, higher, colder than the last.
Nothing moved. Nothing touched me. What I thought was the wind
was only your voice, echoing and swaying among the huge boulders.
We have an opening,
the songs of exotic birds
awakening just before dawn, looping
and skimming in sweeping arcs,
black against graying sky.
Suddenly everything starts to make sense.
Your skin seems radiant in the lucky
light of love. The roads all begin
to lead where we are going, and confusion
is altogether a thing of the past.
The buses continue their circular journeys,
but this time we know exactly where we want
to get off. And what we can expect to find there.

We are translated into another life. Our moves
and gestures, deft and self-assured. No longer
at odds with our surroundings, we watch the trees
toss their secrets into the air like blossoms,
feel our roots taking hold in the dark earth.
Handfuls of angels
spelling out disaster with the waves.
A starlit night yielding to morning.
Sea swelling and falling and swelling.
Breathing. Rising up on its haunches,
pawing the rocks at the mouth of its cave.
Roaring into bright, full-grown daylight.
Spitting at flowers on the sea-wall.
Raging against continents. Eating mountains
for breakfast. Swallowing ships
and men, as little old ladies
follow their dinners with
just a sip of cognac.
            In obscure corners
                                         of my mind
I always found myself
believing
                      that if I could
            only conquer
                                      my fear
of the dogmatist
                         in you, there would
     be something
                                    between the two of us
that would never be
                    finished.
                                      Something
       small, something large.
Something
                      as clear
       and precise
as the snap of your fingers.
Mouth pressed to mouth, we made
                                one last attempt
to make her forget that she
         only the day before had been
   a woman sunning herself on the beach
glancing up at a stranger among the rocks
            who said she later
   might come to
                    regret very much
having entered the
water.
                        With everything moving slowly
   toward where she sat among the
          empty chairs of the old hotel, she was
              desperate about
                    not wanting to believe
the stories I had told her
   about islands so remote
                  the only sounds were those of
           bodies slipping into
the clear water,
          white flesh shining, sinking
to the bottom.
Disturbing to the ear
soft touches fell about
where mountains slid together
just below her northern mouth.

Oh, no. Now
let me ask you this.
Where were you when
they arrived, the soft women?

Oh, no. You
don't know. No,
you don't know.
No, you don't.

              I ought to --
              feeling awfully out of place
              -- I ought to know
              where I belong. Where home is.

It was a mist.
It was a mystery.
But planned by others,
their fingers probing, sliding
among the soft folds.

***

If Dad were here,
he'd show me how to do this.
Now go easy, boy. No need
to rush now.

Oh, I don't know. The feeling
is a mystery, a misery
sometimes. The feeling I don't know.
What I don't know is like a shadow.
It's like a shadow, Dad, that
darkens all I know.

***

Oh, I don't know. There's all this feeling swelling up in me.
I'd like to keep it separate. Keep one thing one place, other
thing another. But if you can read this, Dad, you ought to know
what I'm talking about. It's not like dreams that keep coming back
night after night, but it's almost like that. And it's almost
like something else, Dad. The way the things you remember best
are never the things that made any difference.
Parking tickets,
faded causes
                    & no
           frantic measures,
or anything apt to disturb you.

Chrome-plating guards your city,
where light lifts softly from the sidewalks
& streets, touches briefly at your window, & gathers
once again, so high above your head.
Things change: for the
better or for the worse,
but they change. Even
the things which do not
change cannot remain the
same.

You stop at small towns
on the highway, even at
Murdo, South Dakota. You
take a picture of it, and
then it goes away.
Smith pushes huge triangles of sky into place,
while Harrison erects trees.
Three small birds -- Jasper, Whit,
& Puddle -- whistle columns of figures.
Farmer Brown plants tunafish sandwiches,
but only when his wife is not around.
All things fit together, says the preacher,
whispering behind his hand. All things fit together.
Hunter & hunted are opposite ends of the same trajectory.
I saw you ride away on the last horse
and thought of nothing else for the rest of that week.
As usual, the house (we called it our "cabin," remember?)
seemed empty without you. Your "absence" inhabited it
like a ghost. After several days, I followed on foot
the trail you had taken, expecting at the crest of each hill
to see you trudging toward me in the distance, throwing open your arms,
ready to embrace me, glad to be home again.
But for years then we had gradually been running out
of horses. Our little drama was coming to an end.
Or was mutating, working drastic shifts in direction
which neither of us could have predicted. As now, even as you
vanish, something rushes in to fill the emptiness you leave behind.
They were wondering
what to do about her mother,
wandering through the thorny
underbrush, wading
in water up to their thighs.
On the Mexican side of the river
a burro, thoughtlessly,
watched them.
The air was chilly
for that time
of year. Her mother
must simply be told
was what they finally decided.

Downstream, at a car ford,
there was a Ford pick-up truck
stuck, about half-way across
the river. A bunch of Mexicans
were trying to pull it loose
with horses. By the time
they succeeded, it was nearly dark.
We are not children.
Now we are surrounded by dead planets
and satellites. No longer can we rush
off into the wilderness, throw up a fort,
and send out scouting parties
to harass and enrage the savages.
We've returned to simple pleasures,
sleeping late in the morning, sitting quietly
at a table, sleeping cats in our laps.
This is so ordinary.
There is no way to tell one piece of sea
from another. A man
jumped overboard & walked away.
No one on board could remember his name.

If you've seen one cloud, you've seen them all.
The birds that followed us to sea
are garbage-picking scavengers.
Someone told me that once they land on deck
they have no way of taking off again.

At night, of course, there are the stars.
If you are interested in looking at stars.
I arrived early enough, but never understood
exactly what was happening. There were the customary goldfish
swimming around in circles, bumping their noses
against the inside of the glass.
She sat down with me and tried to explain. The moths,
she said, were everywhere. Even in her bedroom
closet, eating away at her favorite blue jumper.
I did what I could to console her, but in reality
my thoughts had turned elsewhere -- to the geraniums
in the garden below, tiny insects gnawing at their stems & leaves.
A rage swept over me. Damn your blue jumper! I said.
I insulted her--nearly struck her! -- but jumped to my feet
and ran down into the garden. I glanced up,
saw her watching me from her window, tears streaming down her face.
Above me, but just within reach, a modified fish-hook bobbed near
the surface of the water. It was silver, and glistened. I leapt at the bait.
It wasn't enough, was it?
Or did you turn away
before she was finished?

Or was it the gray car
shining in the aftemoon rain
that impressed you?

She had the last word after all,
didn't she?

Or was it the clear, cold
water rushing past in a whisper
a few inches from your feet?
O, someone is sleeping (who is it? who is it?)
someone is sleeping here. My face has been feeling
the brush of her hair. Lightly, lightly.

Nightly the air is on fire. The star bleeds in vain.
The ocean grayly sweeps the empty beach in search of you.
I chant your name to the deserted sky,
but there is no answer.

The fragrance I loved still lingers in this room.
Those hands I yet feel upon my body, rending and tearing.
Joy of the sun, burning my flesh. How I desire you!
Turning my hand to no purpose,
cleansing a smile in clear water --
             words whispered at evening,
             forgotten by morning.
Our feet move forward on a path paved with seashells.
Our lungs suck deeply at the salt-water air.

We are kneeling at a sandy grave. Your hand holds
a jagged piece of metal at my throat. And when my blood flows
it flows unevenly, a river of many channels.

My going to sleep is like waking. My sinking into the earth,
like rising -- a scarlet flower lifting itself into
the stratosphere, reaching to strangle the moon.
The Earth there, lying under darkness
& swirl of clouds around
where blue should be.

             Do you think we were wrong
             about her? Could we
             have been mistaken?

She felt
her way blindly, groping along
the green walls. The gates were swinging open to her.
Before we could cry out a warning, she had entered.

We moved ahead through that green sky,
and it was full of impersonations,
the voices of loved ones and distant relatives
remembered dimly from our youth.

We often thought
of her entering that place. Her blindness
had moved us to pity. We often competed
to see who would take her hand,
lead her through the darkened streets,
and soft, furry alleys.

In order to share her world
we would blindfold ourselves,

or sit in the gloom with our eyes tightly shut,
magnifying the sounds and smells around us,
hearing her voice in the darkness
telling the old stories.

Retelling ancient stories of violence & death.
Three men and one woman together,
living in a narrow valley. She was the mother.
She spoke with the voice of a mother, and saw them
with a mother's eyes.

The narrow valley was enclosed by high, green walls,
which also embraced the sky, high above them. As daylight
faded and night sounds emerged, he would dream of her
as his wife. The soft, warm place between her breasts.
The one between her legs.

And in the shuddering cold of morning, he would die.
The skull-shattering rock, wet and warm with blood.

As a young girl, she was terrified
by the dark, narrow streets. The men of the town
leering at her from doorways.

                                             I wanted to help her,
but couldn't. They would drag her roughly into alleys,
smothering her screams. And when they were finished
I too would throw myself down upon her.

That particular street would be full
of black balloons. The gate swung open,
and you were shoved forward into their midst.
The balloons surrounded you, nudging and clinging,
pressing heavily upon every surface of your body.
With your last breath, you would appeal to
the tiny flecks of green dancing before your eyes.

The words. There came a time when I could no longer
command them. When they sailed into high, piercing wails,
or diminished to points, fainter than the faintest of stars.
Confronted by rabble -- robbers or common soldiers -- I was unable
to deal with them. I was at the mercy of waiters
and taxicab drivers. I became absolutely dependent on you.

After the meal, he would stand in the doorway of his house,
picking his teeth and watching the shadowy figures
passing by in the street.

                                   She would cling to the opposite wall.
To her, his eyes seemed like small fires. In the small, mud church,
the handful of flickering candles in their red glasses
reminded her of his eyes. On her way home, the door of his house
was shut. She hurried along, wrapping herself
deeply in her own shadow.
After the meeting, the blue badges were handed out.
Round, blue badges, with no inscription or device upon them.
The more daring immediately pinned them to their lapels
or shirt pockets. Those who were more cautious would pin them
to the underside of their lapels, or the inside pockets
of their jackets. The timid, or uncommitted, would slip them
into their pockets, discard them later in the street

The well was dry, and he soon grew thirsty.
From bottom to top was a climb of fifty feet, with two secure hand-
holds on the way. He had attempted it and fallen back many times.
He sat now at the bottom looking up. At the top of the well
the sky was like a blue disk. Perfectly round, if he stayed
at the center. Slightly elliptic, moving toward the wall.

The meetings were endless, and she attended them
only because of him. The speeches, the arguments,
went on forever. Eternal disputes over lines of action,
over subtle points of ideological difference. I waited,
watching her watching him. He would fall.
It would be only a matter of time.

The women were with us. They hid hard things in their soft places.
There were explosions. There were accidental detonations.
The sentries would handle them roughly. No longer
was it enough to show them their empty hands.
At night the sky reflects fires,
and in the morning old women search through the rubble
of bombed-out buildings. Sometimes I wonder
what they want, those idiots.

There are always the rumors. Uprisings in the countryside.
Schools and farms burned by terrorists. Or by militia.
Provincial capitals are retaken after capture.
Insurrections succeed, or are put down.
So and so has been shot, or has gone over to the other side.
A neighbor's wife has been betrayed by her children.
The wise man believes nothing,
trusts no one.        
Farming is always a pleasure. Laying a furrow
in the wet ground. Scattering seed in a wide arc,
and watching things grow. Feeding your corn to your pig,
and watching it grow. Feeding your pig to a stranger
who has lust for your daughter in his heart.

Then there's the one about the traveling salesman and the farmer's
daughter. It seems that after dinner they're all sitting around in
the livingroom, except for the daughter, who's supposed to be in bed,
but is actually on the top of the stairs, listening. And the salesman
is telling her daddy and brothers all about his wife, who's a bitch
and won't let him out when he's home. And his wife's sister, who eats
so much she's a cow, but he'd fuck her anyway if there was a flag
big enough. And how when he's out on the road all the chicks sail
for him, but they're mostly dogs or pigs or the horse's ass.
And at the top of the stairs, while he's catching his breath,
the daughter whispers down, "If yer tired o' critters,
whyn't yer try peoples fer a change."

But it's farming is the pleasure. And walking the woods with an ax,
picking a tree and chopping it down. The cutting of it into lengths
and laying it into the fire. Stepping out into the cold darkness
where the smoke drifts away toward the stars.        
They're pulling out. After all this time they're really leaving.
Where are they going? Who knows! Who cares! What are they
leaving behind? Nothing of any value to them. What are they taking
with them? Nothing that matters to us.

                                                          They left at night.
I didn't see them, but I heard their columns rumble through the street.
All night there were airplanes landing and taking off.
Jets were screaming.

Of our own free will, some of us went with them. A few
were needed and taken by force. To those who stayed,
the rest of us were dead. Flying into darkness, we saw
the last green fields of our homeland fading, dissolving.

Why should we have stayed? Most of them are like animals.
Why should we stay and die with them? There are always those
who are left behind. If we survive, if we succeed, we'll do
what we can for them.

But there's no future there to speak of. The future is above us,
dark and flecked with starlight, shot with brilliant sunlight.
The Earth lies far behind us, blue with swirl of clouds,
like the circle of sky at the top of a well.
I'd like to kill you.
Really, I would!
Imagine it. Here I am
hiding among these words and letters.
You sit out there peering at them intently,
failing to find any trace of me.
But then I spring, I leap at your throat,
clawing and ripping through flesh,
severing tendons, searching out your jugular.
Your blood spurts out upon this page,
blotting out letters and entire words, attempting
to destroy me. But I have already vanished,
and you, gentle reader, are dead.
                                The white lady,
whom we all do serve
                                  and honor as before,
         despite her changing faces

but have not known, or mastered,
                          though we have touched her
          as a servant
                          touches his lady's garment

whose dark phase portends disaster
                                         the quaking of cities,
                          spread of disease and pestilence,
          revolution and strife

whose shadow falling on the earth
         brings terror
                                and heartache
and darkness of night to the middle of day,

                          the white lady
turns her back on us,
        and facing her master
                          receives the flaming crown of heaven
        which she wears for only an instant
-- the instant of total eclipse --
                          and then returns to him,
          and slowly turns to smile on us again.
Now, when the cathedral
thrusts twin spires
upward into the darkness,
is when we live --
clamber over arch, buttress, tower,
tweak the noses of stoney-faced bishops,
mock and deride the virgins of downcast eyes,
gouge the wounds of martyrs with our claws,
perch on the heads of saints, shrieking.
And at dawn, when the Eye of God comes
peeping up over the horizon,
we go to our places and freeze,
spend our day waiting for night,
making faces at children sometimes.

***

I made this.
By which I mean I planned it, conceived it.
My friends and neighbors built it,
with their children through twenty generations.
And at what cost! Countless thousands devoting
their lives and wealth to it.
I myself grew old in the scaffolding,
never saw the whole of it, save with my mind's eye.
I have a small place in it, down low, under the pulpit.
From here I can see the rich and the poor,
the believer and the skeptic, the noble and the baseborn,
the citizen and the stranger -- my friends and neighbors
coming and going.  I did this for them,
and whatever it is they have chosen to worship here

***

The whole family except one, is here
down under the chancel.  Our places are marked
by marble slabs.  I've seen these when the curious,
with flickering candles, shuffle among us in the darkness.
To my right lies an uncle I never knew when alive.
Never at home, but always at war somewhere.  A bear of a man.
My father lies on my left.  Not a ver good likeness.
Beyond him is my mother.  I cannot see her.
Our family built this church, though during my time
it stood half-finished, and nothing much was dome about it.
Let's say there were more pressing needs just then.
The one who began it -- he lies upstaris in the chancel.
His tomb is gold.  He said, "I build this church for my people."
What a joke!

***

I've seen dozens of places like this.
This one is interesting, I'd say, but not exceptional.
It's right next to the railroad station, though,
and that's great.  You don't have to spend a lot of time 
looking for it.  During the summer, cathedrals are really
a blessing.  You can go inside and they're always cool.
But in fall or early spring, that's a bitch.  You can catch
your death.  This one has a beautiful organ.  I love it when 
you're in a church and the organ begins to play.
You can sit down in back then and listen to the music
and watch the sunlight coming through the stained-glass windows.
After a long, hot train trip, ther's nothing like finding
a nice, cool cathedral right next to the railroad station.
It's almost like coming to life again.
How does it work, your new machine?
Does it glide you slowly southward
over blue waters, singing love songs
in Greek to you as it goes?
You plug yourself in, and then sit
back and relax. Cozy, isn't it?
Just for you, constellations march
across the ceiling of your room, as
(blue metal finger at your pulse)
it monitors your precious heartbeat.
You fly through the densest atmosphere
without singeing a whisker. It holds you
in its arms and calls you "lover."
And when you went to sleep, you turned
it off, of course. But can you be sure?
No need to worry though. It only obeys.
No feelings or thoughts of its own. No dreams
for its future. No plan that it's shaping for yours.

One hovers near the other,
and if they brush harshly, one against the other,
the shower of sparks would ignite the universe.
They bob up and down on the airstreams,
sharply falling, and then rising steeply.
Drawing together, then drifting apart, metal
yearning for union with metal. They connect,
and the power contained in the one
flows into the other -- pulsing,
surging from one to the other.
Then comes the disconnection.
Then drifting apart, and sighing.
The high platform could easily be seen
for several steps in every direction.
And then dense underbrush would interpose itself.
The teeming plant-life making known its will.
The ones on the platform -- my job to watch them.

Their high platform: lowered in one piece from the sky,
crashing down through the upper branches, disturbing the birds
in their nests. Four long poles and a platform at the top.
Their poles had some spring, and did not snap. The platform
did bounces and tilts for a time, then righted itself.
Came to a standstill. Stood there.

By the waterpool, the two of them were making sounds to each other.
And I got close enough to hear one say, "One over six
by three is three over six or one over two."
The other nodded, "Yes."

Yet something essential was missing. The computations could not be
made that simply and still remain meaningful. Maybe it was the lack
of feeling in her voice. A case of simple innocence, perhaps.

The other spent his days collecting and labeling specimens.
He'd set snares for birds and fasten small metal tags
to their legs. He filled hundreds and hundreds of bottles
with dirt and cuttings of plants. A collector's collector.

The girl looked so bored, I thought I'd speak to her.
"Thirty-six is the square of six," I said, "and seven
is the root of forty-nine." Her eyes lit up, her face
began to shine. She ran to tell her boyfriend,
who reddened, first with anger, then with shame.
He said. "We're not supposed to know that now, I think."

But I guess you know the rest of their story. How their platform
toppled to the ground, all of his bottles smashed. And how,
through suffering, their life together suddenly took on
new meaning and purpose.
The sea is awash with petals of flowers.
It continues to sing its wild and simple song
and nobody minds. Here a squat, brown rock
suffers the sea to break over it endlessly,
over and over.

                        I cling to that rock --
yearning for the freedom of the sea, yet clinging
to the rock. The waves break over my shoulders.

Here waves lift themselves up, toss spume
like tiny blossoms to the wind. And gulls
slashing downward catch up small bits of life
the waves lift up to them.

                                       Yet the force that lifts
will pull them down again to lift them up
and pull them down endlessly, over and over.

I see myself lifted on a tide of flowers, broken
by a rock I had clung to, listening
to the singing of the sea.
It was on the island of Crete
that I began my self-portrait. Crete is the largest
and southernmost of the Greek islands. It was in early
March, 1973. The air was cool, and the sun was warm. The hillsides
were covered with flowers.

In March each year -- on the tenth of March to be precise --
I am halfway between one birthday and the next. So the tenth
of March has always seemed to me to be the pivot of my year.
I began my portrait of myself on the ninth of March,
just before the pivot of my year.

Crete was cool and green in the Mediterranean sunshine.
Oranges and lemons hung everywhere in great abundance. Lambs and
kids frolicked among the older sheep and goats. I was almost
precisely halfway through my thirty-seventh year.

Wildflowers blossomed everywhere -- at the seashore, on the lower
slopes of Mount Ida and Mount Lassithi, even among the ruins
of the great Minoan palaces. Only high peaks and valleys still lay
under snow. The Minoan world began to reach its greatest prosperity
around 1600 B.C., thirty-seven centuries ago. Maybe thirty-six.

So that's a kind of context, I suppose, for me. I'm thirty-six
now, and going on thirty-seven. Born on September 10, 1936.
And I can't tell if I'm rising or falling today.

***

On March 9, we camped in the hills above Knossos.
At the crest of a hill to the west, a low, white house
was outlined against the pinkish-gray sky. As I watched
the silhouette of a Peacock strode across its roof.

Barbie and I had been traveling on the continent of Europe
since a few weeks after my thirty-sixth birthday. By then
we'd visited Germany, Austria, Yugoslavia and Greece,
and had been briefly into Italy at Trieste.

If I were a painter, I'd rather be Bosch, Vermeer, or Klee
than Rembrandt, say, or Rubens. But I'd rather be Albrecht DÅrer
than almost anyone else. If I were a composer, I'd rather be German
than Italian. I'd rather be Beethoven than Bach, Mahler than Mozart.
And I really wouldn't mind being Wagner, Stravinsky, or Webern.
But I have up piano when I was twelve. Today, I travel and write.

***

Two donkeys moved in slow circles under the olive trees.
One was saddled, the other was not. This was near the monastery
of Preveli on the south coast of Crete. On March 18, a windy Sunday,
I finished work on my self-portrait.

For six days and five nights we camped in a beautiful valley
near the monastery, taking long walks through the hills
and along rushing streams. My self-portrait, I'd decided,
should be simple and direct. (Like DÅrer's in Munich,
I thought to myself.)

So, old clothes then, and nothing fancy. Just me as I am,
with a bit of Cretan springtime in the background. Two young
donkeys playing in an olive grove, one biting the bridle
of the other. Or a shepherd and his flock crossing a stream
by way of a hump-backed cobblestone bridge.

***

My eyes are blue, and in the portrait they look toward you,
but not directly at you, eye to eye. My moustache and beard
are reddish-brown. My hair, a trifle darker. The expression on my face
is somewhere between musing and amusement.

You see me from head to waist, wearing a tan shirt, somewhat frayed
at the cuffs. A small triangle of white undershirt shows at the base
of my throat. All of my buttons are buttoned but one.

So there I am. Just a man, thirty-six years old, who likes to write
and travel. A man who loves his wife and lives easily with her.
A man who looks out from his portrait and can almost see you.
His left hand holds a handful of flowers,
and his other hand is hidden.

At the bottom, right-hand corner of his portrait
I put my name and the date.

Ivan Ilyich is dead.
But I am alive. Yes, alive!
Waking in the night, I consider the similarities
between the unconsciousness I have just experienced
and death. From nearby comes the monotonous roaring
of a stream. It sounds like a radio left on
long after all the stations have, one by one,
signed off and shut down for the night.

"a sunlit unity,
desperately sought."

-Keith Wilson
this was
what it was, 
luminous, 
till at night 
it was dark in quiet rain 

a measured step 
in a dark place, 
breathing, regular as footfalls 
beneath the overhanging rock 

sometimes, driving on the highway 
between one valley town & another, 
i will see old women in black 
scratching the dust with sticks, 
or a man walking beside the road, 
followed by an ancient dog 
that trots across his path 
& glances up, eyes glazed 

in the falling particles of light 
the sudden sound of water flowing 
over rocks, around, beneath 
the roots of trees 
                           gathering 
in dark pools 
at our feet
these walls need 
not contain us 

there is a door, 
see, there are trees 

beyond, I will 
take your hand 

if you are afraid 

i like to think of my blood 
sailing with Erikson 
through the long and cold Atlantic night 
having turned West 
not in flight 
but in casual exploration, 
raising the green land at morning 
foraging the sparsely peopled shore 
and pushing West against the wind again.

we live 
on the surface 
of our skins 

water sliding 
in between, 
the window 

in our shower 
open, neighbors 
looking in 

not looking in, 
it hardly matters, 
your breasts 

slip from my hands, 
we love 
beneath the surface 

of our skins, 
in time & under 
water, we 

love 
& sink 
& swim

you are loved
trees in city streets 
when not in clumps or rows 
stand singly
shedding their leaves 
on sidewalks
feet seen through 
a basement window 
moving up 
or down a street 
sometimes pausing 
as though uncertain 
of where they are going 
or where they are
the uncertain traveler 
moves through a landscape 
in circles like leaves
rolling up the valley 
sunday afternoon 
each thing we look at 
single and itself -- 

a single boll of cotton in a field 
a splash of river in the sun 

& all things moving

the cottonwoods, yellow 
by the river 
are with you, 
cool & clear

                                        empty arguments 
speaking, as though to a shadow

cripples & misfits

all-night cafes

pawing the ground, tail to the wind

saying goodby 
is no trouble: 

a house is a skin 
to be shucked 

wriggled out of 
room by room 

closet by closet 
until what remains 

is piles of boxes, 
a few empty hangers, 

a heap of debris 
on the kitchen floor 

which never seemed so wide, 
a neighbor's dog 

who come to say goodby 
from a respectable distance. 

a desolation of friends 
parting in the early evening, 
dry voices under a closing sky.

watching the other, moving away. her hand

we cannot see each other's faces.

but he dreamt, he 
dreamt he was a stone 
lying at the bottom 
of a clear, cold, swiftly-flowing stream 

& someone kneeling on the bank 
picked him up, put him in his pocket, & carried him away 

to a small town, 
took him out of his pocket

threw him through a window of a small house 

where, on a living room carpet, 
he was suddenly at home
there were things he could speak of 
to no one 
          & having no confessor 
he would write them in narrow-lined notebooks, 
locking them first in a drawer of his desk, 
then piling them on a closet shelf, 
burning them finally & stirring the ashes with a stick

he unburdened himself to the wife of a man he didn't know,

there is no warning, you won't recognize anyone, 
the walls of their rooms will be bare 
their floors, uncarpeted 

if you look into their eyes 
they will stare blankly into yours

& when you leave, if you leave 
they will not say goodby 
or warn you of where you are going

he was somebody else,

they could nearly 
touch it --
having spoken, he would now remain silent 
give them time to digest his remarks 
& act upon them 

if they chose not to . . . well, 
that was their business 

no fault of his 
if they, through their own blindness 
& stupidity, brought disaster upon all their heads 

                                       give a fool his head 
                                       & you give him nothing
the female animal-tamer 
reclining on leopard-skin pillows 
surrounded by an all-male, animal cast 

                       the problem, he finds, is achieving 
                       incident, without detracting 
                       at the same time from the central voluptuary 

teeth bared, breasts prominent, hips 
curving toward oblivion 
                                     whip in her hand
into that consequence 
of dreams 
he had not knowingly 

dreamt, 
under the darkest 
of moons, 

seeming 
to know 
but the end 

of it, 
moving 

it was no night for me, 
no night for walking streets, waking dogs 
who always wake & bark at people walking 
late at night it seems 
                       no night for 
looking for the window of a certain girl 
more beautiful than any, a girl 
who undresses for bed & stands 
each night, in the light at her window 
offering herself to the eyes of the first passer-by, 
turning her lights off & slipping into bed 
a fraction ahead of my lurching around the corner 

just between us -- 
she doesn't understand me, 
never has 
                seems to want 
a father, not a man 
                              turns away 
whenever we're in bed 

so, you know, a little trip to Juarez 
now & then 
                    understand me, 
it's not that I don't love her 

		she'd never understand
hearing him say it -- i love you, 
two days in the country 
an abandoned farm he knew about 

the long bus ride 
& him at the end of it, 
grinning 

awaking naked 
hay in her hair 
nipples erect in the cold sun 

it seemed she had only dreamed it 
& country was far away 

between the beginning of it 
& now, so much time 
had passed he had forgotten 
the purpose of it 
                                                     the persistent anger 
                                                     he wore each day 
                                                     like a garment 

there were times he could be caught out of it, 
be caught in a smile 
or a broken laugh 

someone would point, & he 
would put it on again, 
feeling his nakedness 

tonight he finds her unyielding, 
remote & hard, not coy 
                              you only 
love me for my body, is what she says 

which is the truth, but he 
won't tell her that yet 

coming across trees 
parched & angry 
deciding that she 
deserves whatever happens 
to her now, finding 
water in the shadow -- 
					to sleep then & wake 
                                             conscious perhaps 
                                             that some things were 
                                             not as bad as they'd seemed 

relaxing, forgetting 
shooting a rabbit for supper 

it was something about the shoes, 
the way they pinched when she walked, 
that brought her back 

he fetched another pair from the rack 
at the back of the store, 
slipped one on 

holding her right ankle in his left hand 
wanting never to let go, 
but letting go & never 

seeing her again

the walk through the fields 
they had looked forward to, 
she in her way, he in his 

at a certain point 
he would take her hand 
& lead her to a grassy spot 

where they undressed, lay down, made love, 
as they had each summer of their life together, 
she, watching the clouds float 

thinking -- 
things like this 
should have their own & proper names 

this full-grown, clown of a man 
walking out with her 
on the beach every day 

telling her jokes 
picking up colored stones 
& showing them to her 

did he like to pretend 
he was her father 

he liked to watch her
from the corners of his eyes 

                      the half-inch of white flesh 
                      at the edge of her bikini, 
                      the gentle curve of her breasts 

at the door of her room 
he would have liked to touch her 

she seemed suddenly angry 

did she like to pretend 
he was her father 

something about the doctor's eyes, 
a shiftiness perhaps, unsettled her 
causing her to pause 
in the ritual disrobing; 
                                 beyond 
the window there was nothing 
until, below, in the street, a bustle of traffic 

he felt her recoil from the cold 
of the stethoscope, he thought 
she had called him by his christian name, 
which was Charles 

there were times that he wanted to kill himself 

at times it seemed to him 
that consciousness was all 
there was to it, that nothing 
further was called for 

in such moments he would take pleasure 
in recalling to his fingers 
the feel of a knife 
slicing into flesh 

forgetting the feel of his flesh 
straining toward the knife, 
as though darkness 
was all that was called for

the thing was white, 
it had white eyes, white claws, 
white hairy armpits 

the sky & ground were winter white 
as the thing crept toward him over the snow 
slowly, flashing the whitest of teeth, 
whistling whitely under its breath 

during the night, 
yells & screams, occasionally 
the sound of someone running through the street 

there was the knocking at the door, & then 
he fell asleep, dreamt of a girl 
he had known in another war 

in the morning he arose & opened his door, 
they were hauling away the dead bodies 
hauling away the dead bodies 
hauling him away 

her two legs 
passing each other with each step, 
breasts, bouncing slightly 

slightly smiling 
at men who will never 
possess her, their fond eyes 

& instantly knowing 
the sharp, bright eyes 
that do not turn 
away
in the image of themselves, to be 
uncovered, shown for what they are 
& never let to sleep without the dream 
made for themselves 

to be opened, as with knives, 
their innards read for futures, 
projected on the walls of a cell 

sickening & dying
he spoke to her quietly 
in a nickels & dimes sort of way 
but touched 
on the prospects before them, 
hinting at problems 
she was unconscious of, 

                       she standing in their back door, 
                       watching the sun set behind the mountain 

thinking how lovely 
it was in the evening there
after new year's, 
back in the office, 
telling them how it 

had been, how he 
had met her in 
Times Square, at 

midnight, as the ball 
was falling, & buying 
her a drink, taking 

her home with him, 
she, lightly laughing, 
waving a hand, how 

in the darkness she 
bloomed, a pale rose, 
opening, in the early 

hours of the year, 
accepting him, taking 
him into her, & he 

seeing in their eyes now, 
they didn't see it 
like it was
Bill & Joey were friends, they sat 
next to each other in school, 
read the same books, talked to 
the same pretty girls, who couldn't 
talk about either of them without 
mentioning the other in the some breath, 
the some breathless way 

when school was over, Joey or Bill would say -- 
walk me home & then I'll walk you home 

so, together they'd walk the sidewalks 
between their two houses & all the girls 
would envy each of them 

in Juarez 
one Pedro Morales, a civil servant 
roams the streets, throwing poisoned meat 
to the dogs, flinging 
their deflated carcasses 
onto the back of his truck 

farther south 
the Federales burn marijuana patches 
& poppy fields 

in many parts of the world 
men stoop to the doors of ovens & furnaces 
banking the coals, faces the color of fire 

Pedro Morales watches 
the burning of his dogs, the firing 
of the oven, the flaming village 

behind him 
his shadow 
takes on heroic proportions 

it was never like that, 
our memories play tricks on us 
in this place 

the day you burned your hand, remember? 
almost like any other but for that 
& yet it seems less ordinary 

 * * *

but what does ordinary mean, when we speak 
of the days of our lives 
the living of our days 

                            there were places that we liked, 
                            the walks along the river, high 
                            mountain lakes 

                            people would come and go, 
                            & we would like 
                            many of them 

rarely, a walk in the rain 

 * * *

looking back, we see it, see the peaks 
& valleys of it, but without 
the passion, the exertion of it 

this place is another world & we 
look out through the window of it 
on the other, where we were, lifeless
several moments of silence 
& then the beginning: 

               a hand raised
               & frozen
               in a gesture

which may have been 
threatening
three days of rain-swept streets & sidewalks 
people neither coming in nor going out 

our meals brought in to us on trays 
thunderclaps rattling the cups in their saucers
rumors of history 
a blinding flash of light 
the radios all silent now 

too late for love, she says 
& reaches for the sugar
the dead bird rises, 
              the dead girl walks by the river 

her breasts, 
                                  her face 
              more radiant than in life		
& likewise here, 
the living will walk among the dead & the unborn 

    & their glances, 
                         their curses, 
from another time 
                         which is the same time, 
    shall fall 
heavily upon our shoulders 
consciously, 
the rear guard was massacred 
under the eyes of the silent, yellow flowers 

a bird 
flew straight to the cottonwoods 

                                         look                 come 
                                         hear                 feel 

                   october rocks the mind
did something move, 
was there a word 
i didn't hear 

                                 the sagebrush has come 
                                 into flower 
                       was there 
                        anything 
                                  else
these same small birds 
this rough-hewn wood 
these figures carved in weathered stone 

                                    it is unknown 
                                    whether those 
                                    living in this forest 
                                    are priests or gods 

             the man who lives in the cottage by the river
             claims that the forest is uninhabited,
             he worships the thunderer
             & the three mothers

 * * *

                                   through the door we heard music 
                                   though no one answered when we knocked 

                                   looking through the windows told us little
                                   about the inhabitants of the place 

                                   the kitchen was a clutter of utensils 
                                   a fire was burning in the den 

                                   a white, blue-eyed cat slept on the neatly-made bed 
                                   the dog slept near the door, the bird on its perch 

                                   there was no one there, we saw this 
                                   & went back into the trees 

 * * *

riverman came from the lakes where the big stones are, 
came here looking for people, looking for women 

             riverman found two girls, abandoned in the woods,
             took them home, blonde, blue-eyed girls

                          riverman took his pleasure with them, took
                          his ax then, chopped them down 

                                   a fire burning, at the mouth of his cave,
                                   this happened many times, fire burning many times

by the river 
perfectly reflected 
cottonwoods cottonwoods 
reflected perfectly 
by the river
a small sky, red shadows 
opening the mountains 
to the turning wind 

a girl moving leaves 
with a small foot
when i first spoke 
it was in a park 
it was almost sundown 
i was hungry, i said to 
she seemed to have heard 
but turned 
                                        her eyes followed the sun 
                                        i said i hadn't slept 
for three days 
hadn't even closed my eyes 

putting a finger to her lips, she smiled 
& called me to her 
with a sweet charity 
i hadn't known
was in her nature

 * * *

                         only the utmost restraint
prevented my rushing forth
to kill both of them
                             the two of them
wallowing in the grass
she, taking his cock in her mouth
like a common whore
                                 sucking it
until he came, shot his seed
into her throat
his people were a proud & ancient race,
they would never let a crime
against their house & name
pass unavenged

it was through the gray, slanting rain
they rode out, fifty strong,
armed to the teeth

the hooves of their horses
made sucking sounds
in the wet ground

three days later the women
saw them return: bloody,
unlaughing

 * * *

the young boy watched himself
moving over the meadow to her

                      country girl,
                      sitting under a tree

                                  waiting for him
                      or another

they were in this place where the land
stretched level for miles,
unbroken but for the raised stones,
an occasional prefabricated house,
a television tower blinking off & on

they were in love, riding along in
a second-hand car; there was something
in the air that made them expect
to see the sea come up over the horizon

the horizon came & went, another
took its placeno sea;
more stones, another grubby cottage

one country out of
many that they didn't know 
this is the place of torments,
the place where all things come together

this is the place of pleasure,
where all things come together
listen to what she said:

                            in the dark angles & secret places
                            of this room, where sea-wail can be heard
                            through chinks in the stone

                            in the deepest shadows of the night,
                            by the dripping walls

                            you may stretch forth your hand
                            & receive everything

After the armies have passed
and we stand in the doorways
of our ruined, staring faces
wondering if we are safe,
the smell of pestilence comes
carried by our memories
stronger than words, and more true.

You have heard me without speech,
you have smiled, and consented
that we must leave ourselves here
burnt beyond recognition
as a gift to our old friends
who can remember nothing
but the quarrels and the tears.

Then we will force ourselves on
across the broken country
through the darkness of our thoughts:
it will be night, raining, cold,
two sick dogs will follow us
until we have disappeared
into our own silences.
No one expected children:
they had spoken in clear words
of grassy plains with low trees
rising, falling like the sea
below vague and paling skies
not these hot damp jungle trails
choked by the flesh of children.

You're safe inside the movies
where everyone has his place
in the night among the stars
and voices and music play
what you want to know again
and you see yourself alive
doing what the others do.

The river was full of fish,
they said, but who could catch them?
It is like my memories,
I think, green, wild and shallow
through those harsh, broken passes,
and polluted by this town
to which it brought all my life.

On the beach, beneath the sun,
as though waiting for the tide
or the return of heaven,
stomachs, endless hordes of them
nothing else but parasites,
sacks of meat with living mouths
the beginning, and the end.

Forever and forever
these stone streets cross in my mind
like the place where I was born:
that quarter of the first town
preserved beneath the ruins
of your various new lives,
though no one knows it is there.

We'd come so far together,
struggling like two old convicts
sharing the risk of capture
and a minimum of food;
why did we quarrel right here,
just in sight of the border,
when neither could pass alone?

If after these corridors
and beyond those unlocked gates
there were beautiful persons
holding presents in their hands,
you might go on pretending
that you are talking to me
and that I want to listen.
While I stood there in shame,
not sure if I should watch
or run to look for help
or run and save myself,
they fought over your hands
like drunk barbarians.

So good to me they'd been,
speaking with ten fingers
the language of the birds
that wake before morning,
as if they saw our thoughts
and flew from our mute hearts.

Now they are hard and cold,
broken off at the wrists,
senseless as the gestures
scattered through those lost rooms
these archaists restore
who can conjure their warmth?

Or read their troubled lines?
Gone with all the rest, gone,
like the secret of your life
that came to me but once
with the body we shared
before we turned to stone.

Later, when I saw you,
you spoke to me, still kind,
as though nothing had happened
beside those buried years,
as though now you triumphed
in giving birth to me.
As though, as though, as though!

Let me say what is true:
once you held full hands out
in the terror of love,
and took them back, empty.
It happened long ago.
  Beneath those blank skies,
  speechless, silent, stilled,
  blind as stones frozen
  under the snowfields,
  forgotten by life,
  everyone was dead.

  In those winter woods
  nothing but the wind
  hard among the trees,
  some small birds flitting
  through their bleak branches
  more like moths than birds.

  Hoping for something
  I stopped to listen:
  a trunk swayed, creaked,
  somewhere a twig cracked,
  once a crow cried out,
  a dog barked, far off.

  They came at me then
  along the snowpaths
  pointing their fingers:
  You! Liar! Coward!
  Have you come here now
  to carve your own name?
The doors had each been closed
when the sun smiled and struck;
but you remained outside
waiting for the robins,
as though they would fly back
to start your life once more.

All the others were here
come to hide from that light,
people who seemed like us:
they had stared at the stars
and sung back to silence,
vanished now, like the past.

But where had summer gone?
Far into the future,
like the love of hybrids
or strange simple fossils
rising in new mountains,
not yet a memory.

I called to you, I called
from behind my tired eyes,
because I was afraid
you would be lost out there,
wounded by the morning
and changed away from me.

How much I wanted you!
Now that we were all here
and locked in for the day,
we played in our torn beds,
pretending we were safe,
pretending we were young.

But you never answered,
and you never returned.
So that I taught myself
the things I thought I'd need:
I learned how to keep time,
I made an alphabet,
I showed the children death.
And when I rummaged in you
I found some bad romances,
their pages marked by a girl;
some stained teeth like buttons,
stale kisses older than love,
fake pearls, a bible, a muff.
None of it belonged to you.

But our secret's forgotten
when fanatic childhood goes,
just like the combination
of that favorite old lock.
When you asked me to find it
you meant to make me happy,
the old dog with his old trick.

A vacation wouldn't work
best move on, just move away.
A walk through the museum,
though, to recall those old times,
preserved like premonitions
of our coming helplessness,
and then we would be ready.

One day he put on his best
and went out to see the town.
One day he threw a big party.
One day he ran round the house,
naked, roaring like a beast.
One day he played his records.
One day he wouldnt get up.

She wanted to very much.
Nothing fitted anything
although each had its own name
and belonged to her by right:
she nourished all her parts
as if she were a garden
that he would come to enjoy.

Still you couldn't understand.
There was blood on everything,
a network of molecules
enormous, invisible,
and neither dead nor alive.
It is the same everywhere.
We must bend our heads and drink.

It was an endless parade,
and they jammed Sixth Avenue:
Armies, Navies and Airplanes,
Clerks, Workers and Bosses,
Actors, Dancers, Deep Thinkers ...
I knew you waited for me,
but I couldn't cross the street.
You raided our sepulchers,
for trinkets hacked up our graves
and ripped these numbed bones apart;
now we lie, restored, exposed,
scattered among broken tools
and blurred lines of joys we took,
but will never give to you.

That hair that held me to you,
thick as waterweeds, summer,
and smelling of moist, bright skin,
that hair you wore has vanished
as though my life had been kept
in these crushed blue pigeon's eggs
thrown down from our tree today.

Out of my mouth those people
born like insects underground
swarmed up in black, humming elouds
and obscured the afternoon;
they were the barbarians
we had long been waiting for,
and we tore down these dead walls.

We can go where we damned please
as long as we look alive,
because the roads are open
right across the old mountains,
and because you remembered
a place that had sun and sky,
though you forget where it was.

I stood on a frozen street
right in the middle of town,
waiting with all the others
for a break in the weather
or a pretty girl to show.
When she came, weeping, naked,
no one would toss her his coat.

Suppose everything were glass,
the walls windows everywhere,
and through our transparent world
the fire of its core shone clear:
wouldn't you help me up then,
and wouldn't you understand
how much it hurts to love you?

There was no one in the room,
the mirror lied: lied lied lied!
Whenever she telephoned
she was frightened by his voice
Do this that and the other
as if there was time to think,
as though she were still alive.
You had hidden it from me
better than ever before.
I ransacked all your beauties
yet you made no resistance
to my terrible demands.
When I had finished, you said
"The place is inside the sun."

And then we fell fast asleep.
You dreamed that others would come,
bringing flowers and creamed cakes
like kind foreign gentlemen,
while I made good my escape
from that house of correction.
When we woke it was snowing.

Years later you dug me up:
rough bronze was what I'd become,
corroded by my own thoughts.
Yet neither could remember
what my purpose must have been
or how the way had been lost,
though we were just at our spring.

Oh we laughed when I came home
blackened and clawed by the sun
and that proud of my fat catch.
There was too much for us,
so you called our close friends in
to feast them on our blessings.
That night my fear filled the house.

And on the way from summer,
climbing through the mountains
up that unfamiliar road,
we slowed for breath near the top:
to the East lay our old seas
like the memories of birth,
like the shore we'd abandoned.

I was not one to sorrow
because I had died so soon
you could eat our fruit alone.
So that autumn's come, and cold,
and you walk through maple groves
hearing only your footsteps
crush these bloody, brittle leaves.

You'd nowhere else to hide it:
I had crossed your continent
and swum out from your last rocks,
dazzled by that blind daylight
where you stand with open hands
like a loving wife, and say
"The place is inside the sun.
A chest of old remedies
dried up and dusty with age
was all that remained to us
of our dozen long winters.
When that spring sickness returned
we were not prepared for life.
That was why we quarreled so.

How many fixed, faceless eyes
have you glanced into, curious,
in that fearful cut instant
of passage on the curved roads?
Invented by their own thoughts,
human more or less human,
these, the beings of the road.

Had I ever won gambles
I might have stopped this cheating.
My children are taught the law:
they gaze at me with calm eyes,
their faces clear as flowers,
empty of hope, or pity,
empty of comprehension.

Mouth to mouth, in our bodies
we found this ancient district
dying in our lost city
where we wait for each other
watching the late traffic run
recklessly with gouging lights
through cold stone streets past locked doors.

I wanted to find that book.
You never heard of that book?
He could not finish that book.
She wished she had read that book.
Had they always known that book?
We will need to have that book.
Was it after all that book?

In the darkness of your room
the smell of fish, weedy brine
and rotting mussels grows harsh
as though the sea had rolled up
pouring in over my life,
and ebbed, and left these ruins,
when the moon dropped from the sky.

Everything held the secret
and everyone talked at once,
openly, simply, with smiles
that seemed to welcome one in
as if we could understand,
as if we had always known
what was to be done with us.
And when the box was opened
it was a wedding present
brought by barbarous uncles
don't you remember the words,
that old music, the dancing,
cakes and wine and so much food
and how everyone kissed us?

And afterwards, when they left,
when we were alone at last,
poking through those gay ruins,
late towards our first morning,
when we were too tired to laugh,
we found it in a corner,
trembling in terrible fright?

And how we waited awhile
wondering what it could mean,
until the sun filled the room,
giving us no other choice
don't you remember it now?
how we threw ourselves down then,
and how we killed it, and ate?
Outside, the great gray boles
of the silent elm trees,
the suffering elm trees,
swayed in the storm's first winds.

Then massed low winter clouds
heaved and shifted and rolled
relentless over us
out of those torn black hills.

Inside, in our bedroom,
surrounded by roses
fading on the five walls,
we lay and watched it come.

We had no strength to move
together or apart,
but lay there cold, frightened,
waiting for each other.

Nothing we knew of life,
after ten years nothing,
but that the works of love
had passed with their seasons.

Then in that room's quiet,
as that house groaned and cracked,
there were words, whispered words
seeping like dust from those walls.

Dry spinsterish voices
insisted, insisted
we must quit, we must die:
there was no more to hope.

We listened, we listened
for hours to that sadness,
holding each other tight
tight, tight. Until we wept.
They all wandered in vague circles,
eating what they found or might catch,
sleeping where they dropped, night or day.
They survived, and told themselves tales:
We want nothing but this desert,
we are safe here, watched by angels,
and fitted for the lives we lead
these beaks, these strong legs for our shells.

Centuries and centuries off,
as though it were there, virtual,
over this plunging, dim canyon,
across that flat waste of mesquite,
beyond that ridge of stonedry hills,
like a spring of cold, fresh water,
is the place I have headed for,
each day one step, one step each night.
Your highways are open
and littered with bones,
but beyond the barbed wires
as far as they can see
your gentle land rolls brown
and waistdeep in summer.

They're crossing the high plains
at eighty miles an hour;
the noise of the radio,
the noise of the motor,
the noise of the parched wind,
batters them hard, like lust.

You have never seen them.
Or if you have, you think:
I'm sick of those drivers
all alike in their cars,
covered with sour dust,
hands trembling from the wheel,

thin long legs cramped like crows'
and pants creased at the crotch,
voices cracked with misuse
and thirst and loneliness
behind those sunglasses
burnt eyes burning at me.

And you think: They stop here
because I'm beautiful,
because I might want them.
They know you're not, you don't.
Supposing they were free?
There's nowhere else to go.
There it was in your room,
dead, still warm but yes dead,
and you were the killer,
and no one else had come,
and no one had seen it
or heard that loud struggling.

What to do? It was late,
but never late enough.
You had friends, yet were they?
People seem skeptical
of someone else's luck;
police of course are worse.

Every old story
of every such room
came back to fill that night,
until you thought you'd wake
insane with hopeless fear
and never get out free.

There was one solution,
though, there was one for you
tools lay in the drawers
and dishes on the shelves:
you cut, you trimmed, you cooked.
You sat. You ate yourself.
            
            He was very busy, he said,
            he had to finish a big job
            he took on a long time ago,
            something to do with his uncle
            the Button King of Babylon:
            the old man had made a shrewd fortune,
            but as for handing it around
            he was tight as an old maid's cunt.
            So that was that, and there I was
            out in the cold as usual
            asking myself if I was nuts;
            but it was good, and I knew it,
            this time I knew it like I knew
            the next one turning that corner
            was a nigger without a coat,
            red eyes burning me through the snow.
            It wasnt even even dough;
            I could have gotten ten to one,
            lookten to one on a sure thing!
            Let the folks have first crack at it,
            I thought; it's absolutely safe
            and all they're risking is the nut
            like ten to one on this dollar
            next chick round is hustling supper.
            Just because they own the whole town
            they think they're like god or something.
            It's ten to one in your favor,
            and you dont have to do a thing,
            I told them, but believe in me
            that this time it wasnt a hunch.
            So? So I asked the old woman
            to turn a trick once more. She did.
Across the room, that woman
watched him with her hard brown eyes,
eyes bulging through their own strain
as he talked of those great eyes
that had vanished from our books.
"One would say we'd lost our souls."
Soft, gray, luminous, his eyes.

Once, and only once, I gazed
into eyes I'd never seen.
Though they showed no friendliness
they held no senseless hatred.
Wise they seemed, more than patient.
Yet when I smiled they mocked me
in return. Those eyes were mine.

When, over a filing case,
your hands paused and turned their palms
to reveal the strange pattern
in their lines, like the numbers
of one of those who lived on
after their own extinction,
I dared look up at your eyes.

In the streets I hunted their eyes
like an addict seeking friends
or a sad cruising fairy.
Towards evening, perhaps,
the fever would burn me out
and I might go home and eat,
as if I too were human.
                                   
Lambs, rabbits, calves, scalded swine,
turkeys, geese, fish and lobsters
all the market's opened eyes,
edible and as blind as ours.
Admiring, we wandered through,
choosing among slaughtered friends
heads we hungered to devour.

That blind girl wished she could see
what we looked like in our flesh.
To us she was beautiful
and could not know what we knew:
that we looked at her with joy
but never at each other,
for we feared to see ourselves.

Your mouth waited for my kiss,
your eyes opened like morning
and I came to you gladly.
Inside your eyes it was night,
empty, illimitable,
through which I fell, forever,
towards remote, beating stars.
Under the ceiling the smoke
wallowed yet, stained, usedup smoke;
the fire dropped into cinders,
throwing cracked glcams against them
where they sprawled, stale and stupid
in the trash of broken lives
they would nevcr need again.

I climbed over their bodies
up the steep and littered stairs
turning only once to look
at what we had been doing
during that long evening,
as though I would forget it
in a lifetime of evenings.

Shining on the crusted snow
the light of a cold, late moon
spilled the silent rooms with ice;
sornewhere a branch scraped the wall;
somewhere a tap was dripping;
and somewhere a girl sobbed
softly and beyond control.

Down that strict bleak hall I went,
past exhausted bedrooms
towards the malicious door
that had resisted my strength
till nowwhen it was so late
when it swung in like a trap
upon your naked laughter.
The icicles were dripping
and the cold gray clouds hung low;
the taps were in the maples,
the snowfields heavy, sunken.
White houses stained by winter
waited for the thaw to end,
and everyone had the flu.

If they werent stupid drunk.
There was enough to go round,
yes, of everything but good words,
laughter, and a friendly touch.
And what did we talk about
in those Adirondack days?
We were afraid of the Jews.

Our young physicist sang hymns
what Sundays he didn't ski.
All I knew of my best friend
was: he hit what he aimed at
and shot at everything,
his wife went to bed at eight
believing she was a witch.

How much warm milk with honey
do you think you can swallow?
Those winters are very long.
At the end we hunted ghosts
with music and candlelight:
Huron, Mohawk, Iroquois
not one of them came to help.

I think something had gone wrong.
When the wet spring was rained out
those hot summer storms began:
people with incomes drove off
as those old shanties choked up
with black Southern families
trucked north to stoop for our beans.

It was a poor land round there,
living from the catalogue;
we found nothing to bid for
at their Saturday auctions
but ourselves, and we were poor.
Still if we'd offered these souls
would they know what they were for?

Some had babies, some tumors;
it was a lively piece of news
when Margaret's dinner burned;
a life of old storm windows
to be put up, taken down.
Those who survived would live on,
past eighty. The rest were dead.
"In my old age I have grown
abundant and determined,"
William Butler Yeats declared,
failed painter turned poet.
While I, writing thirty years,
consign my fictions to hell,
for they were but fictions all.

My eyes belong to my' head,
and my head is full of eyes:
ten thousand words wouldnt do
to make an image, not one,
that should be as clearclearer
as the things I think they see
waiting patiently in me.

There is space, and there is fire;
there are bodies everywhere:
some are worlds, some barren stones,
some, like women stripped, bodies
nacreous or rose or masked,
lie hiding in their own forms
waiting patiently for me.

One year I pierced my canvas
with flame to get past those shams
of painted cloth; the next year
drilled through the wood I worked on,
painting breasts like eyes or stars
places' I wanted to reach,
waiting patiently for me.

Nothing satisfies for long:
the brush the hand, or the forms
they throw out and leave behind
as though they shaped in my mind
merely to make me lose heart
because I see too much in here
waiting patiently for me.

But I know just what I want
as if it were there for me,
there between my brush's tip
and the blank bright canvas wall:
it isathing visible,
substanceless yet more than real,
waiting patiently for me.

Waiting patiently for me
at that hour when I wake
undressed by sleep, such small sleep,
a few moments out of life
in the arms of the one wife
I have always known as you,
you wait patiently for me.
I had failed all of their tests
but you still believed in me
as if they didn't matter,
as though you were my real friend.
Get out, get away from me,
take the sun with you, and leave:
you don't need me anymore.

She was singing to herself
from the night that she was born,
and listening to her song
we could hear, or thought we heard,
There's an angel in a star,
and he burns my life away
yet where are they, where are they?

They chose and chose and chose and
still I wasn't ehosen in.
It was my bad luck, they laughed;
and when I dared to complain
they threw stones and knocked me down.
"Only fools cry," Father said,
"Look, your name is on that stone."

Our war began in springtime.
That summer we planned our fort,
eollecting stuff to build it
and storing up the weapons.
When fall came round we waited,
watching the four streets all day.
Winter buried us with snow.

While my legs were in the cast
I had only this window.
Before the sun set she came
by herself and played that game.
I held my breath. Long long long.
Later I ran and told her.
Is that why she hates me so?

Always he'd love me, always.
And he showed me his closet,
which was like death, and naked.
But he knew where the fish were,
there, hidden in the deep pool,
after the woods, by the glade.
Yet I liked the quiet one.

Come here, they said, and do this.
Sit there, they said, and eat that.
Get up, lie down, go to sleep.
They said they said and they said.
There was just one place to hide
when all the others had been found:
here, where no one can see us.
It was a voice at morning
and again at the sunset:
words singing themselves, strange words,
old words, older than the world,
words not in any language,
though sometimes they seemed out there,
sometimes in here, in ourselves.

When I woke up, my father
stood there in the moon's shadow,
and I smelled the blood on him.
We were to run together
all night to the place prepared
long ago by the old ones.
There I would become a man.

So many came into me,
thrusting, heavy, whispering,
none the same yet all the same,
as though I was what they wished.
At noon, in the sun, I laughed,
and they turned away with shame.
What did they know, those children!

Once it had been 50 simple:
we walked in a great circle,
thrice round, and we understood.
When that circle was broken
and nothing could hold us back,
it all changed: now there were stars:
stars behind stars behind stars.

And the tribes fought each other,
the beasts, the birds, the fish, trees,
insects, the worms in the earth,
all intent upon their lives
in mutual, silent war,
as though the world would be theirs
yet the mountain only slept.

I did not see what it meant
when you showed me house and field,
man and woman, and asked me
with your good smile to come in.
There was much work to be done,
the work of ten thousand years,
done, undone, before the end.

Our home crumbled at a touch,
like an apple made of dust.
We drifted away, apart,
out into the night of cold:
bits, fragments, brittle crystals
in which our selves had been sealed,
nameless now, and beyond death.
The mines had been sealed off,
the cities forbidden;
winds stripped away the soil
and filled the rivers in;
but the killing went on
as though they wished to die.

The roads were blocked with cars
in which sat stubborn men
cradling guns in their laps,
and women whose faces
would never smile again,
long, dry, childless faces.

They sat inside themselves
waiting like emigrants
for permission to move
until the crisis passed,
the last of their crises
in what seemed a lifetime.

And when they looked outside
toward the horizons,
the valleys and the hills
stretched crude and motionless
beneath a small, gray sun
silent as a stone bell.

Since the first announcement
they had been wandering
in these dim processions
across the vacant land:
there was nowhere to halt,
only the way ahead.

If they come at evening
out of the broken light,
or else before the dawn
when dew chills the dead earth,
they will ask a question
we answered long ago.
Into your mouth my name
my head, my arms and all
my body following,
sinking into the night
that spreads its growing tide
over all the beaches.

Currents and dark channels
wandering like old roads
across a vague country;
silence, indifference,
a prison without walls
or other prisoners.

Naked I carue, unarmed,
into your emptiness,
and stubbornly went on,
until my name, my thoughts,
and my swimming body
were all dissolved in you.
There was a feeling, I know,
as if you had bought some fruit
and put it on the table
where we could watch it ripen:
apples, pears, and oranges,
figs and a few bananas
the hearts of sweetness, and flies.

Suppose I had not come home,
suppose you'd forgotten me,
or grown tired of this page
as the light began to fade?
I see you closing windows,
or pausing at the mirror
I see you touching your lips.

It is here, you whispered, here
and nowhere else that it was;
like the music of traffic
in our terrible city
it must be known to be heard
and yet nothing is harder
than to listen to one's self.

There is the wine in the glass,
and the long evening drinks it;
there were words we waited for,
and they changed us like our lives;
but the night needs only night
so that, being what we are,
we turn to our beginnings.
Of all the sisters he had
not one was fertile, not one.
They crowded about his days
imploring him for a word,
a touch, to keep them alive.
When he shut his mind up tight
they cursed him, and his children.

The woman was as swollen
with what I was to become
as a victim nine days drowned.
Yet it was not natural,
not pleasing, to discover
that the bottom of the sea
was the place where I must live.

After those ten million years
and a world of continents,
I was just as they had been,
like a fossil snail in coal:
the lines of a simple life
that had been lived without thought
yet would last longer than death.

Our wide August raft floated
down that long, slow Sunday path
among old ones and children,
and youths naked in their clothes.
Then you spoke one word, my name.
The leaves turned brown. It was winter.
It was now. I was alone.

You had expected kindness
from my memories, at least.
When you visited that park
in which you had found your love,
addicts of hunger and sadness
were drifting through the dim woods
like poor, lost, mangy mongrels.
But still, it was not something
dropped in one of those dark times,
like our old family ring
that had seemed precious as life
and which you lost yesterday
it was still here, in ourselves,
and younger than our children.

So there was nothing left
of all we had been given;
and yet you woke today,
you sat up after a night
of tears of deathly struggle
against them and their angers,
and smiled at the new sunlight.
I thought I knew that language,
but could not read the pages
that glimmered before my eyes.
I was not drunk, not dreaming.
I was dazzled by these tears,
living tears wept long ago
and by other eyes than mine.

It seemed as though you knew me.
I was a street near your home.
Spring had come. You wore new shoes.
A ball bounced out from the curb
but you were scared by the cars.
Then summer, then winter came.
When spring returned, we had changed.

I had not slept or suffered;
yet, as the ear elimbed the hill
and you looked away, I knew
long before we'd reached the top,
where we would halt, confounded
by that calm, shoreless desert
that my mind had eracked like glass.

Her father owed her too much:
the kiss he never gave her
was bestowed by his brother,
in the fields, against her wish.
Twenty years it haunted her
she did not know what she wad
until they died, and told her.

I lay on my bed, waiting.
I had taken twenty years
from my life and made them one.
There was no more left for me.
Nothing could bring back my life.
No one but I knew the truth.
Soon it would come and kill me.

When I think of you, you come
ten thousand miles are nothing.
Like the memory of love
your kind and naked body
stands here in silence, opened
to the dark jazz of this death.
If I knew your name, I'd speak.

Inside the stones there are birds,
and inside the birds, rivers;
in those rivers, little fish
and in those fish, the stars shine.
The stars were nothing but light.
Then they were dust. Then they fell.
How long ago that all was.
Now, when they are old and sick,
they say they have lied to us,
that we must learn the real use
of the only tools we have:
fingers and feet, and these jaws,
though later on sticks and stones
may prove to be good weapons.

Looking at you this morning
as you stared into the fumes
of your black and bitter cup,
I saw how far we had come:
between us there was nothing
but the past that we'd forgot,
that lay waiting for us now.

If I were the messenger
bringing fresh air from Delphi
like news of April flowers
after a lifetime of winters
anemones and daisies,
such azures, scarlets and white
among those formless ruins...

When they left us behind here
they took just their lives with them,
which were all they could carry,
and but all that we wanted...
I meet them though, now and then,
in my dreamsthese frightful dreams!
happy, doing what they like.

In the middle of the night
windows split, shattered and fell
as though invisible fists
went rapping them at random;
outside in that storm of glass
thc streets were filled with black men,
mute, and patient, and unmoved.

Towards morning, blood rising
in the unlit antique squares
where those white fountains yet splashed
their pure and selfless music,
a dead stillness woke us up:
perhaps an hour remained,
perhaps not. We would make love.

If you walked out now, at noon,
to look across the desert
where colored broken mountains
crumble into boiling sands,
you would see that we're falling,
falling, falling at the sun,
and you would never come home.
I remember a city
maddened by its own people,
black, loud, shaken by machines,
where light burned the open eye
and air filled the lungs with pain;
there, whatever was, was right,
and no one looked at the sky.

And I remember those roads,
swift and merciless as lust,
that coiled about our city
like a living, shrinking mesh:
they were their own laws, the roads,
and their desires were obeyed,
gladly, as if we loved them.

And I remember silence,
as though everyone stopped
at midday just where he stood;
there were no clouds above us,
but high, high, blown by great winds,
silver speeks sparkling
like motes in our swollen eyes.

And I remember thinking,
slowly, with dead clarity,
how I hated old people
for their money and their lies,
and pitied these clever youths
who swallowed all or nothing
that I wished my friends near me.

Silent, we searched across time
through telescopes, wondering:
What books had he saved to read?
How would she have her baby?
Would it rain for you that year?
Had those natives slaughtered them?
I must invent a science.

Halfalive, this drifting world
exposed to the last forces
and far from the granite caves
in which are heaped years on years
the bones of our lost parents:
here men lay dreaming of women,
and the women dreamed of men.

And then the attack came down,
logically, by itself,
as it once did in that tale
when the waters rose and struck
and we found out we had lived
on a vanishing island ...
Smiling, they said, "Now begin."
That first time you were naked
I cherished my dreams of you:
there was no one there at all.
The next you were in the flesh,
waiting to be found, like love.
The last time, you almost spoke.
I remember your long arms.

His anger moved in her mouth
like a prisoner's prayer:
the happiness they wanted
belonged to other people
who are cleverer than they
and live next door like neighbors,
yet much too far for comfort.

Ten years that struggle went on,
as if with these two bare hands
I took by the throat my mind
and fought it down in the dark,
panting, sweating, murmuring
like naked famished lovers
who would die if torn apart.

I was to call him master
though he was my hundredth man.
Pale, thin, cruel, wet, nervousmaster!
And I to be his creature,
even my mind, like these breasts.
But what did he make of me?
Less than others hadand would.

Because I knew you loved me
I was no longer ashamed,
neither of my helplessness
nor of what I'd done to you:
it was your face I kneeled on,
it was your face that I crushed
six days, six nights, in that train.

Hair will grow into their eyes,
and sand will fill their nostrils;
their fingers will fuse like wood
and their feet freeze to black stones;
but they will be wide awake,
they will listen, they will think,
and they will want to make love.

Suddenly our road ended,
nowhere, in a waste of sage
the last lights of America
had disappeared in the dark
a hundred miles behind us,
and out there, blocking the stars,
loomed vast old forms, the mountains.
How long had we been living
there in those slums of summer,
there in that dank, cursed ghetto
where flies fought over bad fruit
and the smoke of people's eyes
hung along the seething streets
through which we found no passage?

Nothing rare or good remained,
everything was secondhand,
used and reused like old books
whose words are strange or stupid:
although it was Octobcr
and they seemcd sick of their past,
they would never let it go.

In our poor, bare, dusty room
we gnawed at one another,
rolling on the Boor like dogs;
our windows, jammed half open,
passed their angry shadows through
and filth that their hands flung up
fell in onuswhere we lay.

It was like a dream, we said,
and we were still like children;
there was no way out, we said,
or if there was, they knew us
by our walk, our low voices:
we were friendless, we were thieves,
and they hated us at sight.

When the rains began to fall
and the wind closed their shutters,
it was time for us to leave:
now that winter was coming
only the stones stayed behind,
the cold, black and ancient stones
glinting with indifference.
My turn will come, you said,
and I shall wake you up
one summer afternoon
like rain in the window
you neglected to close,
and you will curse yourself.

Because your hand will hold
nothing but your own flesh,
dry as your opened mouth;
you will think of my name,
you will want to call me,
but your tongue will not move.

And in the other room
the radio's playing
that bad music it blares
as though I were with you,
or you yourself were there
yet you will be alone.

You will watch the warm rain
falling beyond the trees
on an empty meadow;
not a bird will fly past,
not a car will drive by,
and the day will not end.

It may be your own past,
an hour of memory
that has returned to you
or which you have become,
a time that may have been
part of you, or may not.

How you will want me then!
More than you want to live:
and you will discover
that every bit of me,
all that you thought you had,
is more than ever real.
I closed my eyes and walked
about the house where I
had lived for years, and sulked,
and ate my tongue, and cried.

I groped the hall for you,
my chair, the couch, our bed;
when I touched the window
how chilled I felt, afraid.

A dark mirror, so dark
to my ten famished fingers,
which closed, and would not work,
but gripped these angers.

Inside my mind your voice
sounded vague, vague to me;
old thoughts, old hopes, the curse
of love that's gone away.

"The best of our story
was that we'd never find
ourselves hurt, or sorry
though broken by the wind."

"Shall we not meet again,
speak of our missing life,
asking when this began,
this death, this unbelief?"

How long you had waited,
I said to the dumb walls,
to see me so treated,
a prisoner, and fool!
A half a glass of beer,
a plate of fish and chips,
a long cold foggy day:
out there on the water
slip slap slop like always
with a few gulls asleep.

They think it's monotonous,
they think it's just a fad
you will grow out of yet
like you quit hide and seek,
driving the car too fast,
or touching every blouse.

But it's not that, not that;
there's a basic rhythm
that goes on forever,
and you sit out there and wait
and watch the steady swell
and take the one that counts.

Sometimes nothing happens.
Mostly nothing happens.
They break, you break, or both.
The day passes, a day
like all the other days:
the tide drops and you quit.

But sometimes there's a wave,
that certain lift you feel,
a shadow in the green,
and you know it's the one
and you're with it coming
you're on, you're up, you're in.

There's never someone else.
There's only you alone.
If it's right and you're right,
you're walking on water,
coming in from the sea
as if you were just born
though you never reach shore.
  They wanted our house,
  our clothes, our money,
  they seized everything,
  everything we had
  then they took our skins.

  All that year we walked
  towards the border,
  followed by their eyes,
  as if they pitied
  or could understand.

  In time, somewhere else,
  we grew whole again
  and our lips made sounds
  which, if not human,
  are the words we have.

  They cannot find us
  or destroy us now,
  they have forgotten
  that we ever lived
  Here we wait for them.
For eyes I gave you rubies
twin emeralds for nostrils
I set your mouth with sapphires
and filled your ears with pearls
all the rest I made of gold
so that though my gifts were praised
when they brought you back to love
their hands should never stain you.

And then I forgot your name,
forgot where I laid you down
as the bells began to ring
it was just noon I think
our rotten priests were preaching:
We must fight! and We must pray!
but no one would, no one could,
and their troops went marching by.

We were given up as lost.
Long years, bad years fell on us:
coarse weeds grew in our dry laps
goats and sheep flocked against us
their foul swine rooted in us
mongrels came to scratch and shit
yet we refused to stand up.
That brook saved us from the death.

After so many mornings
a last morning came to us:
the sun broke through our hard sleep
and tore away these covers.
Yet, despite your nakedness,
I could not apprehend you.
Later, in that library,
dim, cold people seized my arms.

And afterwards we wandered
with the roads, everywhere;
sleety clouds pressed on the hills
and closed against the city,
streets and houses turned to stone
and the people spat with hate
because we passed their doors by...
yet we'd been there, long ago.

And so it went, on and on,
through all those days of our lives
and in the dreams of our nights:
there was nothing we could make,
there was nothing we could do
but wait, and wish for an end.
When it came, we were surprised
to find ourselves waiting still.

Now I recall your story
as though it had been mine,
as though I woke at midnight
and lay for hours appalled
by its incessant vision
like those alien paintings
in the old museums groups
of tired tourists must endure.

Let me touch you now, hold you
let me find you warm and soft
let me take away the things
that are neither you nor yours
let me speak to you once more
looking into your kind eyes
as if you would come to me
as if we lived here again.
I had lost my cleverness
and my humor, I had lost
my strength, my love and my hate:
I could not find the true word
which I must say to find you
and yet you were beside me,
to the left and just behind.

I changed again and again
but always seemed just the same;
I killed and cursed, wept and fought
my way to an unknown house
where I stopped, baffled, and heard
a greeting so familiar
that I knew it must be you.

And here was my professor
seated at his writing desk
in his starched white doctor suit;
the Midwest air, hot and wet,
filled his booklined room with death,
and as he smiled, smiled at me,
I saw he was drunk, and mad.

He knew a secret doctrine
by which bourbon would unlock
the history of my face,
the mystery of my race,
if I'd wait with him for dawn:
when I stooped to shake him
he spoke his prayersin Greek.

There was nothing more to do.
As I turned from him, he cried
"Watch me, and I'll show the way!"
He wore a long golden robe
and a shining golden crown:
as my torchlight struck his face
he leaped laughing from the room.

Our car crashed in a plowed field
and burnt itself to nothing;
we walked on across country
stumbling through the morning mist:
cows danced by with full udders,
and a stallion galloped mares
round us in thundering rings.

Pigeons sprang up at our feet,
and long files of geese flew past
on our right, to the Northwest,
the way that we were going:
and when we found the great trees
shading the slowing river
we took off our clothes, and slept.
I had known who you were
long before I woke up
and found you beside me,
before I turned the car,
left, down an unknown street
full of such poor people
who stared as we drove through.

At the end, at the wharf,
the ship was waiting still,
the great old famous Queen
with the thousand cabins
and the holds vast enough
for all that was needed
on the long excursion.

My mind was not made up.
And I had no money.
What had I left undone?
Yet I could not return.
But where were they going?
It had not been announced.
And I had not been asked.

While the gulls screamed and swooped
we crept on board her then
over an unwatched plank.
Behind us the city
that had been deserted
so many years ago
spread silent, empty, dead.

Lines on the Neck of a Crude Amphora Which I Dug Up in a Field in Sicily
Under the Stars
I've come for your eyes you said
the door shaking between us
my dumb knees braced against you
my shoulder jammed deaf in you
hard I feel you breathing hard
hoarse sighs words clogging my skull
these words choking me stale sounds

you know who it is you said
the lock rattling between us
my heart whines at my ribs
I hear you singing you said
your scorn hissing sharp as hail
ripping my scalp like salt claws
my lips crushed glass dry grinding

ask me what I want you said
these hasps squealing between us
my neck stiffens in its sheath
as I take your blank force heaved
a wave bulging the wall in
my tongue groans at my cracked teeth
rust flakes my throat bloody scales

have you had enough you said
the wood splitting between us
alone in my skin I sweat
under your hard flashing pulse
my flesh turning and turning
its fat seething like kisses
my lungs burnt open crumbling

let's get it over you said
the door broken between us
my coiled muscles burst apart
my guts spill out at my feet
my bones shatter in crystals
and blow away like blind dust
even before you touch me

you thought you loved me you said
I'm here now take me you said
I will give you what you want
you said nothing more than this
you said your voice flooding me
with your hot blasting silence
why dont you answer you said
It was that red moon rising
through our bitter city's fumes,
and the fires under our streets
that seethed pounding steel and stone
into a slow oily dust
on which we lived, like crystals
Condemned to breathe, I cried out

And that bright planet rising,
there, beyond our haggard roofs,
that distant evening friend
who follows like a good bitch
and keeps her clear eye on us,
wary of our promises
Condemned to touch, I took you

And later, that pale river
of cold light across the sky,
too far to carry us now --
what did we say it must be?
dead clouds, or a mist of souls
blown off by the polar winds...
Condemned to eat, I ate you

It was then our count began,
and we measured all our stars
and knew each one by its name,
marking its history down
from white light to russet flames,
and our night shrank, our night grew
Condemned to hear, I killed you

What was left? the world prostrate,
and in this furnace these bones,
glowing on their mound of ash,
all that remained of the past,
hissing, snapping like green wood,
charring our eyes, and the moon
Condemned to see, I sought you

Do you recall those hard roads,
frozen, gray as the small moon
hanging over these blank hills
where we wandered, drifting west
with those others, armed shadows,
men and women and their dogs?
Condemned to move, I came here
As our earth and sky went black
I stopped and stood, I waited,
without moon or stars or time --
no, you were not among them,
you were nothing anymore --
and our long night almost gone
and I was awake at last
Condemned to live, I speak now
but this is where I came in
I said floating fast asleep
my fists clenched my feet kicking
my eyes shut to the salt deeps
my tail thrashing at black ooze
here the currents carried me
as though these waters were mine

and here is another door
I said when the surf opened
and I crawled out dreaming still
on the bleached and broken shore
my bones swelled in my soft skin
my snout lifted from the sand
as though these sharp rocks were mine

but there must be a way there
I said beyond this cave's mouth
and I strode out in the snow
my arms before me weapons
my eyes fixed on the high pass
where the winds whirled the light round
as though this world were mine

and the last door is that flame
I said that flame flowing down
like the sun falling like air
falling earth water falling
and I ran on into fire
my thought burning through my sleep
as though its ash would be mine

but here is another door
I said walking into you
mother your breast waiting wide
father a child in your lap
myself a child too once more
my dish my spoon before me
as though this were our morning

and I woke inside my sleep
I said as the door swung out
poor streets poor walls poor windows
the staring blanks of slummed faces
mouths fading behind blurred hands
ruins like women begging
as though their love had been mine

but this world is hard I said
break it take the seeds of life
plant them in my heart I said
water them and submit me
to your heat I said your sun
till I wake inside my life
I said as though it were mine
your hands wrung these words from me
shook me dry as this old book
that has laughed its last and wept
and withers here in the dust
mouse-stained mildewed forgotten
in the lobe of my left lung
where it waits for me like death

like a man born just today
out of his own life saying
but does my mother know me
she knows me she knows me not
and does my father know me
he knows me he knows me not
till the answer comes like death

like my family my friends
who gather at this table
in the wilderness my home
amongst these sweating machines
and show me their broken cups
their empty plates their hunger
surrounding my heart like death

like faces condemned to live
on the anger of cold stairs
trudging out their conviction
from nowhere back to nowhere
just as I climbed on your words
from the child's grave in my arms
to this sentence served like death

like my one love my lady
lying in her narrow bed
her thoughts bitter as her breasts
her hair clotted in her groin
my tongue stumbling on her teeth
our groans of futile passion
flesh beating at flesh like death

like prayer this offering
made from fossil scraps strange signs
phrases buried by prophets
beneath our floor of charred stone
the smashed skulls of temple feasts
remnants of some other life
hidden inside us like death

without words I know your words
promising me your silence
when I can stand in the sea
and feed the hands that feed me
when I can find my own face
and know what I know no more
you will speak to me like death
this is the way waking is
you were here just as I am
whispering to me your breathing
wakes me now you can hear me
look at me lying naked
as the sun in your mirror
and blank as your eyes and mine
like water trembling naked
at the edge of this calmed shore
where you watched for evening
and listened to these shadows
our words floating suspended
on the surface of our lives
between your day and my nights

stones my animal hands dropped
shells scraped thin scarred by my claws
bones pounded open sucked dry
strewn like words through your strata
darkness hidden in darkness
where you vanished with my name
my animal name in your mouth

my faithful animal legs
still prowling your lost forest
will pause where paths met and passed
silent paths that led to time
once a great tree living here
rooted in my heart in rock
bare now cracking in the sun

no passage for light in me
yet my patience grows like sand
my animal feet sinking
in shattered crystals of sand
dunes of bright sand wandering
where my desert drifts silent
and its stars have no stories

behind me beyond those hills
a stubble of stumps rotting
where the stream winds itself down
cold and clear rattling pebbles
in this head like my hard thoughts
of nothing but nothing but
your water your pouring light

until I know you are here
and my animal heart laughs
lungs cry belly bleeds and face
my animal face breaks off
leaving me alone my life
tied now head to toe to you
my life my animal death
    Asleep, curled in your pocket,
    he waits, his wings quivering,
    and with his two old friends dreams
    of those moist, those blue mornings
    before these shrinking, white days
    that crack our chilled hearts like glass
    came to tell us of winter

    Do you remember those breasts?
    How straight she walked, eyes opened,
    her long arms held out, her hands
    strong and tapered, cupped flowers,
    offering you her friendship,
    like the touch of love's kindness
    her smiling lips showed she knew?

    Out of an early hour,
    with a flecking of salt spume
    you could taste on her shoulders
    and her hair heavy with youth,
    faint stars caught in its coiled ropes,
    she had come to greet you, yes,
    so that you would see, and know

    And you woke, as though the sun
    were waking too, round and warm,
    and growing from her belly
    as she stood there in silence,
    waiting till you rose, and stood,
    till you let your locked thoughts go
    and welcomed her against you

Again! Again and again!
Dont you remember her breasts?
that bright sky that shone on you
as the garden turned drifting
amongst those mountain orchards
and the sun pressed sweating down
on their swollen, dripping fruit?

And then she laughed, how she laughed!
her smooth limbs flung blazing wide
then wound round you tightening
as you thrashed in terror, trapped-
all that day long you struggled,
a beast, child, man-a young god
crying and singing and wild

as the hot red dusk crumbled
and fell in ashes on you
where you sprawled between wrecked walls
your bones burning themselves out
your mind staring at that sky,
cold, blind, black and high, so high...
Dont you remember her, now?
I brought you these broken words
a basket of oranges
fingers, toes, liver and lungs
gave what I thought you wanted
what I could no longer use,
here, on this side of my life --
and you threw them in the trash

Eyes, you said, your tongue and heart
your belly and guts and balls,
not that empty, polished head!
Now carry them here, spread them out,
salt them, soak them, wash them off,
put them to simmer in me
with herbs and wine, for tonight
I carried your breasts for you
I followed your long thin legs
across the sand to the edge
of the world where the stones die
I took your rings from your hands
your clothes from your warm body --
and sat here, waiting for you

Merciless words you whispered,
your hands stroking my furred face,
until my mind was flooded
with space flowing like blind winds
pressing forcing me open
to your blank stars, till I knew
that love, too, must be endured

On the other side of fear
you waited for me to come,
my breasts swinging freely now,
leading me to you at last
through these rough waves of cold light,
to lay my life down on yours,
where yours lies, a dead altar

You carried me to the end,
my blood running iron flames
from every fault in my flesh
You lifted me, drank me dry
and shattered me on your stones
My love, you said, my poor love,
will you ever understand?

Now the mountains are naked
the rivers tighten their nets
the grasses grow like fevers
the sea fills with living ice
We have given these bodies --
I to you, love, you to me --
and taken them home again
All that day they strolled past me
flexing their innocent thighs
their song pitiless, secret
humming strange words I still hear
like souls saved, soft and glowing
I could never find myself
while I waited for their eyes

At the bottom of my stairs
I waited always a child
crouching at home in this street
shivering, my few words fouled
my wrists bitten white with fear
hiding your love up my sleeve
where it sucked my hot eyes dry

When I touched your opened lips
when I licked your turning tongue
the walls cracked, the wind whistled
roads rose and fell in my brain
birds above those roads flying
your words waiting for my mouth
echoes trapped in these mountains

Feet tied with your running hair
fingers crushed by your shoulders
ears drowned in your flooding breasts
my throat pressed between your hands
hands heavy with long waiting
that tear me out of my face
before I find your secret

Ask me, you said, what you want
lift the stone of my lost head
that black rough turning stone world
harsh and buried in your lap
dense as a dead star and packed
with ancient thoughts, thoughts waiting
and mute till the end, like you

Bodies, sealed bodies waiting
face to face, or back to back
back to back, or head and toe
head and toe, or side by side
latticed, laced and sliding
like plasma into my heart
swollen with time, radiant

Year by year I climb, ravaged
up my stairs again with you
in my hands torn and savage
your words waiting, whispering
beating like my life on yours
and yours on mine, like the waves
that burst from your ravaged eyes
running nowhere on these sands
following my shifting shore
as the sun swells with your light
above that seething steelblue waste
blank from my groin to these eyes
pursuing my own footprints
my ears stuffed with my own noise

down that dust comes windblown coarse
splintering my metalled flesh
blasting me dry as these hills
that rise shaking our world
day and night mountains trembling
between your patient breakers
and our flattened human lands

like weed your light grows on me
though washed ashore you held me
where I lay slashed by hooked beaks
your seagulls scavenging me
till my emptied shell shone, pearls
these pale rainbows locked in me
your light ground out by my life

in me no light grows but this dark
because I would not sit down
with my own life like a man
nor stand still one hour to watch
your hair glowing in vines of light
out of your eyes, your belly
your legs your buttocks your back

nor kneel at your red fountain
where the lava boils in you
your armpits bubbling like lead
your throat burning, saying yes
o yes love, you are coming
on my streaming paths coming
pressed to my broken walls, love

where you clutch at me bleeding
your knees shattered like ruined shells
throw me your torn scalp, you say
bury your fingers in me
unravel your shirt of nerves
like glass threads and twist yourself
round my wrists, come, love, you say

I have you now, love, you say
your guts writhing on my coals
stomach liver kidneys spleen
your bloated lungs and bladder
thrown to your own starved shadows
love, I wear you now, you say
like stains on my clear body

When my wife wrote this poem
in my dream last night I laughed:
she knew all the ways to say
hustle: hustle and hustle
and hustle... I woke, hustling-
there we lay, third stage burned out,
orbiting and forgotten
Four times I crossed this damned town
north south east west drove all day
just burning up the freeways
as long as my gas lasted
and I was still a free man
with my wheel in these two hands-
but I never saw you there
She lies alone in her bed
cold hands pressed between cold thighs
her skull swollen and empty
as her eyes, her lips, her breasts-
he will come, carry her down,
pour her out of her lost life,
and burn his dead fears away
We were numbered, each of us
a number but those numbers
burned into us through our skin
a reference in the files. .
oh quick, quick, find us find us
before these ashes crumble,
whirling numbers on the wind
For homes they levelled these hills
surrounded you with their guns
while we sat and drank our beer
watching his dogs tear at her
because she's cunt she's proud she
says if it's good then take it
but I think I'll burn it down
the map showed no signs of us
when you held it to the light
no wrecks rusting in your veins
no white rows of broken teeth
or flesh torn, flapping like tents
burnt through by forgotten wars-
yet it's there we'll die, again
I had made my life my god,
who cursed me with my own words,
these cold letters burning you,
everywhere, like a blessing:
so that my death brings you life
and you think that you are free...
like the stones that walk this world

what am I who else but me
monkey twitching monkey hair
lipping my toes ca ca ca
in my tunnel in my trees
blessed by bees my me my me
sleeping with my family
like me like me ca ca ca

you yes you you know it's you
no one else where you are you
squatting at the wall the flies
the sun the stone merciless
cities driven from each door
your father's face in your hands
your mother's voice in your cries

him oh him he feels himself
climbing in his contraption
his praying machine now up
now down his darkness carries
him his words whirling him now
light lighter than light and how
he stands himself on himself

from space she falls from nowhere
her dreams sheathe her skin like gold
her eyes cut blanks in the void
and she floats through time shining
as though flying to herself
that strange warm body down there
turning dark like this planet

coiled inside itself hiding
itself resonant with lust
to be itself to be all
in these hot cells its gardens
invisible acids molds
dust quivering and common
living on death's vacant winds

what do you think of our place
we built it for ourselves look
the walls thighs roof backs floor breasts
patched males females hands knees good
filled with sand our old home look
when we come here we will stay
tonight our tribe is starving

this morning they knew it all
each one came to his own stone
each stone touching every stone
face to face harder than hate
one long slow joy without light
until their eyes were ground out
their thoughts crushed fused lost like love

they have reached these vague borders
occupied passes swamps plains
patrol these hot forest trails
they regroup rearm confer
they command the air above
they are ready to invade
they think the dead defenceless

years we marched from day to day
we ate root stem leaf flower
and fruit we tore flesh sucked bones
laughing together dancing
weeping like children we killed
and burned our own fat for light
never thinking they would come
first it must be found once more
although it was never lost
it waits somewhere like a thought
the thought is shaped like a key
this key fits a certain gate
yet that gate was never locked
because no one built this wall

unseen she turns reflected
in the mirrors locked in her self
all light lost in her black holes
her ears her ass armpits nose
cunt navel womb her blank eyes
her mouth is open singing
fuck it baby ofuck it!

dust swelling hot radiant
bursting he hurtles dispersed
beyond his own space boiling
bulging from his bones like time
fists feet skull knees neck shoulders
his prick his teeth clanging o!
love, mother of the muses!

there you are but coming here
like a steel shadow always
and shaped like your poor body
under living fire shattered fires
you surround your enemy
yourself hunting yourself yes
have you understood have you

I wake now I stand I breathe
I walk I find touch seize you
to me they trooped my armies
my savage children trampling
eating my face drinking blood
storming my blank wall
they find us together now

I lie strewn on these blind sands
that shift in the August breeze
and blow back on winter gales
etching my bones grain by grain
with faint words I speak now
as I slide from these seasons
a man falling from the sun

what sifts through my bleached skull
agate chips shells emptied claws
frayed bits of broken silence
floating up to the world's skin
as I sink in this long fall
through the staring darkness
through time through these dry sands drowned

and dropping slowly drifting
past the frenzied spinning worlds
past stars that blossom and burst
raining shattered light as dust
that sweeps over the last shores
in dead foam of bitter pearl
blasting the void where I fall

straight through this stilled universe
crushing our stone to nothing
like a thin floor of hard space
and far how far below there
a lake of black waters wide
cold waters held deep held pure
in the open hands of death

towards which I am falling
my life burning out my bones
cell by stubborn cell crumbling
dissolving my selves at last
waste shadows traced through this night
lost between being and not
annihilated and gone

plunged at the end and falling
still falling towards that lake
those ancient heavy waters
no hands can touch no mouth drink
waters waiting under the sands
for all that falls from above
and falls thinking to the end

to enter the quiet pool
stripped of hope fear stripped away
and every fearful turning
of that rope of twisted words
that tied me to my own thoughts
naked of words now and thoughts
I slip blank beneath its waves

my cold fingers touched your toes
as I climbed from that lost well
and traced your pale steel veins around
where your heels joined the dead rock
I clambered up your ankles
scaled your shins gripping your calves
with my torn and sweating life

and clung to your knees a ledge
where men have perished before
iced gusts swinging their frayed hopes
against the stone of your legs
as they climbed those swelling thighs
through white mists that hid the way
beyond the trees of their world

towards you where you must be
where I must crawl up the night
mounting you by thrust and haul
between these blank slipping walls
vanishing above hidden
from the man climbing to you
hand over hand for his life

out of that dry sunless pit
where my infant bones were thrown
in the beginning broken
on the broken moons down there
a sacrifice to our lives
dying like our savage friends
while I climb in your groined depth

to pitch my body at you
turning and walled in you now
warmed by that bloody darkness
walking that narrow way at last
as though welcomed as though saved
restored to speech by your words
so that I may climb again

from that gemmed cleft towards you
roaming your forest a beast
among your beasts forty years
like forty days forty years
hunting the light of your steppes
where I may think like a man
as far as a man can see

till my mind looks up once more
groping for your breasts for love
looming at the world's end love
waiting in another air
another world where your heart
opens beating like the sky
and I climb towards you again

your hand touches your breast here
where I lie fading a bruise
like my words my lips my tongue
holding your hurt heart my mouth
gripping at you still attached
as though my teeth were fingers
tracing a path through your veins

towards you as you drive west
into that gentle valley
up a vague road winding slow
among the rolling pastures
as old as America
yet virgin still and waiting
for you to carry love here

like the pain your hand touches
silent as I am silent
when you stop by the white house
standing awash in dead leaves
fallen over these years leaves
I remember them brown years
I had seen coming for us

whispering my words to you
again beneath your hand words
pressing hard against your breast
as though I stood beside you
opening the door wide now
for you to enter autumn
through this evening darkness

lighting the fire pouring wine
setting out apples and bread
as the year closes our time
where you sit with me and drink
hearing the wind in your oaks
tear at these words I write words
winter flings against your hills

while flame wraps your night once more
our cries flaring like embers
before the chill rains sweep down
flooding your gardens and field
burdening your path with ice
blocking your way towards dawn
the world's light fogged and dimmed cold

and gray as these morning hours
crumbling into words like ash
where you wait for love alone
for the sun to break through here
under your hand at your breast
to warm what remains of me
stone that cannot speak again

she squats over her burnt years
scorching her slimed monkey's cunt
filling that bronzed bag her flesh
with fat from my bitter thoughts
so that she swells she trembles
she coils her creamy muscles
her eyes pleasured and molten

oozing sighs like salt etching
these phrases in my clawed cheeks
and grins as she scrapes my wounds
and whines as she kneels at me
her tits fuming naked frost
her ass spreading over me
wide as this hard arctic night

sinking its locked weight on me
grinding my arms down my legs
pressing me doomed in her dream
beneath her swollen body
biting pitiless as ice
shattering me with her tongue
until my silence bleeds stones

and there is nothing but stone
sliding into her numbed head
though she is thinking my name
which is her cry her language
and singing my name gig gig
which she stuffs in her dry mouth
and cursing my name gog gog

like my life caught in her throat
choking us both gag gag gag
what does she want from me now
screaming out of that dropped paunch
because she lost her bright eyes
dancing around my clay legs
taking my thoughts from my teeth

for I am her god her thing
she shakes me when I stand stiff
holds me to her ear and waits
for me to speak strange sounds words
rattle rattle speak new words
her lips whistling whispering
wanting words she takes from me

and wraps about her shoulders
where she squats by the glass wall
hairless whimpering to me
that she has not taken all
piddling on these sucked out bones
and craving craving my sweet words
devoured in her wintry lair

now his hands are at my life
tearing these pearls from my throat
my gold bands from my locked wrists
my warm robe from my shoulders
his hands strip my sleep from me
as I watch his face his eyes
watching me in my mirror

where I see myself waking
standing in this room alone
an empty lunar crater
flooding now about my thighs
with time's lightfilled urgent dust
rising like his words pressing
and soundless as love forcing

me on its forgotten way
to this meeting in me where
I have never come before
where I cannot come again
until his living fingers
bless my silent lips these stones
sealed like my body silent

opening my dreaming eyes
at last to my secret death
among these broken passions
these enemies and lovers
starving friends who bind my arms
leading me always astray
from the memory of life

when I want to drink my life
from this cup my poor fathers
gave me the cup their fathers
carried from Jerusalem
the cup he places in my hands
filling it with blood pouring
my life for me to drink now

until I come to myself
and stand like his shadowed self
here in my wide empty eyes
before me in my mirror
calling him to me from darkness
discarding this long silence
and giving myself to him

as though he will gather me
together in his hands
and restore my scattered years
in that hour brief as love
before I fall from that joy
down to my darkening sleep
where I wait for him once more

she opens the book and reads
black letters blank words phrases
like these written in my head
by a hand rough with bear's blood
sentences stitched together
pelt by pelt and worn
a lifetime by a strange beast

where she sits there is no dark
the winds tear round in my head
keeping the carcasses cold
the fire smokes the walls glisten
with wan light a winter's life
flickering in its stone cup
shaping these words from shadows

until they fill her cold lap
with blood that streams down her legs
to the ground my father's ground
packed with thinking bones with words
like these words wrapped in ashes
formed by the forms forming her
from the words on this dark page

as I was from the stone roof
that glittered with insect stars
in that staring woman's eyes
where she lay by the low flame
summoning me in my flesh
and thrusting me at your world
to be destroyed with the rest

leaving what is left for you
where men fall fighting these streets
with hands stripped naked as girls
women roaming wild like cows
gaunt boys clutching at their breasts
children heaped in your doorways
spilled like plastic bags of trash

can she hear me speaking now
I am walking back and forth
through her eyes in a circle
tirelessly from line to line
my words making her lips move
as though she saw herself stand
raising her arms towards me

and calling my name the name
she knows I have forgotten
the name written in her book
in lines cut in her body
wound on her long arms like snakes
waters clouds rivers of rain
masked by this script like my name

I am here for you hiding
scattered like hydrogen's dust
inside you thinking of me
inside me inside these words
spreading deep cold hope darker
than love can follow or find
hunting the blank fields of time
inside you thinking of me
these heavy grains condensing
inside me inside these words
warming the simple matter formed
glowing in our silent thoughts
a blue world like light growing
in our arms burning us white
inside you thinking of me
inside me inside these words
cast with the elements to drift
whirled through our red giant's heart
and thrown into time like hope
everywhere hiding and lost
beyond the last reach of love

inside you thinking of me
inside me inside these words
our world wasting now a shell
cracking our life time shrinking
and space crumbling in on us
where love lies hiding from love
sustained by hope no longer

inside you thinking of me
inside these words
flaring brighter than before
from passion's ruins reborn
out of the silence to burst
like blind particles fierce hopes
bodies through bodies streaming

inside you thinking of me
inside me inside these words
spinning from the hidden heart
these dark messages pulsing
from the shrivelled source flashing
like blank fertile matter speaking
our death to the living stars

until love's last radiance
contracts on its own core
heavier than all time lost
hidden from the universe
sealed in its sphere invisible
inside you thinking of me
inside me inside these words

We walked along these high walls,
which have no gates, no windows,
which stand scarred, burnt by old wars
and barbarous, mere neglect.

When we asked what lay inside,
they said, Your lost paradise,
your holy city of love,
which will never let you in,
though you may march forty years
round and round, blowing horns
and battering at its stone.

A foolish story! you said.
A story for fools, I said.

Day after day, we kept on:
this must be China, we said,
ruined both sides of the wall.

So we searched for our lost selves
here in our human desert
where all must live, and all dies,
even those old Emperors
who made this forbidden wall
that keeps us from the city,
the holy city of love
that will never let us in...
till we stand still, you and I,
in silence, and build our own.

the broken neck of the vanished jar
remembers the oil the water the wine
that poured through its thirsty throat
the body that held it high, so frail,
shattered into its mud again

this thickened throat remains and
    remembers and speaks still
of bodies filled with fresh joys
the water oil wine of ancient ways
hand to hand out of the world
    into the world again
as though this neck held the head
as though that vanished fulfilled body
    restores itself
in time with us again

Their presences draw near
of all that I must fear;
no others seem like those
who come from nowhere close,
from nothingness appear
and stand in silence here
as though they came to me
because they come for me.

My life my flesh my bone
are mine, but not my own;
[who was eloquent,
who am, inconsequent
now as spent violence,
standing in the silence
of a ring of many,
a silent company.

No matter what I do
I do not speak to you
though I am speaking now
how I do not know how
and though it's you I see
you do not speak to me;
of all whom I did fear
your presences are here.

The technique of love
The technique of power
The technique of laughter
In this bottle you see morning
on this shelf is grass
here are specimens of turning,
nights which you must pass

love distilled from antique mirrors
tinCtures made of breath
pills of joy and powdered terrors
things to ease your death

the formulas of secret fears
catalogues of dreams
the bones of hope, the flesh of tears
what is, and what seems

all, all has been found out, tested,
certified as true;
time alone must be invested:
we depend on you.
Where the heart was, a domestic chasm, an abyss bridged by snow
As France, once great, collapsed into tourism and poetry
Behind the sublimity, obscene

Unable to command even the words useful to propose toasts
Having filled space beneath the zodiac with debris
And found the moon in its rounds merely vague

This is the town he has chosen to live out his time in:

A DELUXE BODY & FENDER SHOP
                               BUILDING SUPPLIES
                                     DRUGS
                               FUNERAL SERVICES
                                    FLORIST

                               MEATS & GROCERIES
                 in emergencies call THE OPERATOR (dial zero)

He conforms to everything
He worships pleasantly
He tinkers endlessly with mixed drinks
He reneges on the Revolution, though it tore him from his chains
He tolerates melioratives
He addresses queries to psychiatrists who answer in
     newspaper columns
He deplores the inhumanity of the avant/garde
He praises fools, and suffers them gladly
He preserves himself out of perversity, and perseveres

And in secret, at odd moments, he makes metaphors of royalty
Self piteously beginning Petrarchan sonnets thus:

                             After the Coronation
            Forthright, busy Fortinbras summoned me,
            Courteous, condoled a little, and then,
            Snapping for his secretary, took pen
            And signed me out ofhis drumming country...

Surmising that force brings no apples from the bare branch
Like a dark prophet in a wilderness of bright people
Full of exotic necessities
Or like a rational Messiah
Sojourning with brutes, sweet boys and hairy girls,
He busies himself studying the culture of perfume advertisements
But this year June came on bucolic.
We wore shorts, went tanned and barefoot.
Bright, hot, clear, dry; green, fresh, sweet, thick.
Apple, pear, lilac, rose, chestnut,
dandelions, primrose, peonies...
We breathed, stretched, breathed: ah we were free!

But there were more bugs, and worse too.
Houseflies and bluebottles swarmed and lit;
Adirondack blackflies came through;
venomous deerflies, how they bit;
big, lazy, thirsty mosquitoes
so quiet they could sting your nose!

But we felt, after months of snow
and that total absence of birds,
this June was our reward somehow.
So we got wrens and hummingbirds,
orioles, cardinals, phoebes
on our porch, sills, gutters and eaves.

But now silence, and no children.
Just last week a halfgrown fox, mad,
bit the art collector's widow's man
and slipped back to her dim, dry wood;
slipped out, bit our recluse, Priest,
in his patch at dusk: poor sick beast.

And so a week of rain and cold.
No flowers, no birds except crows,
no dogs barking at this gray world.
Where the vixen went no one knows.
Troopers scour gully and pasture.
We stay in, quite out of nature.
Those mad quarrels went on and on
and then she wept, and scratched your face
because she no longer loved you
because she'd lost her slender waist
lotions, unguents-her skin flaked

Was that sensible: love, love, love?
always hungry, belly and groin?

So you made this garden for her
hacked grass, plowed loam, harrowed, spaded
planted Burbank's Patented Prides
hoed and weeded, mulched, staked and tied

But did she drop her golden brush
did she leave her silver mirror?

So, what's there in the freezer now?
your corn withered on its tall stalks
squash rotted, too big on your vines
tomatoes, stung by frost, blackened...
While she nibbled and smoked and paced
or read her fashion magazines

Yesyes, she jeers, yes but
look what he's done to me!
When he takes me driving
I count telephonepoles
So damned bored so damned bored
I cook exotic meals
O Raphael! O Gabriel!
O Michael! Brandish your swords!
It got colder and colder
Then lights began going on
I whispered, Honey, don't be scared
They'll be undressed too

And so it was...
We had lost that shimmering darkness of our clothes

Right out loud I said
(was I complaining?)
She wore me like a brassiere
She ate me like a diet
She used me to fill her purse
All week I worked in that office
Thinking of ways to redeem her
Cash her in at face value
But never found the right time
Or my suitcase, or the bonds
She was too quick, too stubborn
Look at her-unkillable!
Rapidly she got pregnant
And gave me this litter
(what did I do to deserve it?)
One three/colored, sixtoed calico puss
Two tawny tiger toms, the gray female
And a black yelloweyed runt named for me
That I stepped on by mistake, in the dark
Just like a farce!
At last my heart, though it has no reason,
Gave up such unequal struggle
And delivered me from myself
-- And from you!
A PROBLEM, hypothetical, in the form of a piercing dilemma:
    Surrender may be cheap, but life costs too much.

A SOLUTION, hypothetical, in the form of a cornucopia spilling
      queries like random streams of lethal particles from which there
      is no shelter (except to exist in the saltmines).

AFTER SWITCHING the light out, but before dropping onto
      bed (why not make this your setting/down exercise for
      mind and heart and senses?), stand chilling awhile
      at the window, contemplate the darkness visible of
      that moving universe you are glad to escape once more
      for your personal, uncontrollable slumber, and consider
      what it asks: Why is it there? When will you be
      there? How can you get there? And where (should you
      miraculously be the very one to guess the right answers,
      1,2,3!), and where will you be when you are there?

COULD YOU, perhaps, have been studying the wrong subjects
      all along? And were you, friends, inevitably and
      necessarily misled by malicious gods (or ghosts)?
      Or was it your ancestors' accidentally accumulated
      and capriciously edited tables of law, of latitude,
      logarithm and organization, which both propelled
      and misguided you on this course? In any case, given
      the right chance, if such there be, can the antique
      weapons of the foundering vessel somehow be turned
      against the strangers in our midst, that is, against
      our heirs? Will you try? Would it be any use to
      you to do so?

BUT, MY FRIENDS, after having devoted yourselves with such
      intensity to your lonely regimen of daily jogging and
      pushups, or, alternatively, to mastering the intricate
      systems of progressive jujitsu, which affords security
      against superior antagonists, what can you accomplish
      in the face/to/face, one/to/one contest eternity
      demands?

OR, NOT LOOKING THAT FAR AHEAD, what will account for the
      liveliness of some old men and the stupidity of others?
      Their glands? Is it money, diet, programmed/exercises
      and regular check/ups? Is it meditation, character,
      fate, or a subtle definite proportion of each combined
      in a certain way? Is it maybe climate,
      or even race? Can it depend on the quality of the
      disciples who attend them? Perhaps it is merely an
      illusion fostered by the imbecile selfishness of
      the rest of us, who are all just the same
      quite as human although we never realize it?
      Was there, in other words, a woman to be searched for?
      Or, possibly, which amounts to the same thing in the end,
      a woman to be destroyed?

LOOK, TO PUT IT ANOTHER WAY, Suppose The Revolution is
      coming? If so, from what direction? And who is to
      be executed? And is there never any possibility for
      an honest reprieve? And when The Revolution comes,
      what will it bring to the surface, extended monstrously
      over the undulant dim waters like the Great Pacific
      Squid basking in the starlight, more unreal then than
      the scattered and hearsay reports of its existence?
      Furthermore, which one of you will be imaginative
      enough in his inescapable despair and sufficiently
      brutalized by events to prepare The Counterrevolution,
      and afterward The Countercounterrevolution, and so on?
      And meanwhile strong enough to endure forever the
      plangent echoes of the bursting bombclusters and the
      howitzers firing in rotation, the muted, vibrant,
      thunderous idling of the enormous jets and the regular
      convoys of trucks and tanks, and the printing presses
      day and night pounding and rolling, the staccato of
      loudspeakers shouting over them, amplified unbearably,
      and indeed the peaceful rumbling of the diesels of the
      field/turbines, and of the tractors, the bulldozers,
      the graders and the shovels and cranes and rivetters
      and pavers, and then the busses and typewriters and
      comptometers and computers and cashregisters and
      airconditioners and, mingled with it all, always,
      roocoocooing here and there like courting mourningdoves,
      the machineguns, the machineguns...?
      Is there any substitute for the sound of the human voice?

THEREFORE, NOT TO ANTICIPATE FOR YOU the unknown
      pleasures of white hair in retirement to the paradise of
      patriarchal irresponsibility, let me ask you what is
      bound to occur to you sometime, somewhere: in the
      satiny, stainless/steel, fluorescentlit and automatic
      elevator rising and sinking morning or evening with
      that sickening glide in the sealed shaft, or when,
      after jerking to a stop in the tunnel, the engineless
      commuters' train waits, stale, then jerks creeping
      ahead, or as the car is sidling forward in suffocating
      endless traffic on the hazy parkways, or sometime
      while you are manipulating the dials and punching the
      keys in their marvellous sequences, or while listening
      patiently to the minutes of the previous meeting and
      jotting down notes for the minutes of the present
      meeting which will be read at the next meeting (and
      glancing frequently, furtively, at the selfwinding
      wristwatch), during the sorting and filing of the week's
      correspondence, or at the weighing/in of the luggage
      when en route to conference sessions that will it is hoped
      occasion an even greater flow of correspondence,
      or perhaps with the anxious yet fearfully excited and
      curious intake of breath as you unfold the morning's
      incredible newspaper or later yank hurriedly at the
      recalcitrant cigarette machine in the lobby for the 
      necessary second pack, or even while, in one of those rare
      free hours, dialing the right number (you know this dear 
      number by heart!) but hanging up after the first buzz,
      your palms moist and cold, or, in the dentist's
      waitingroom, staring fascinated at the fullpage
      fourcolor photographs and wondering with envy and
      stultifying dismay just where on earth those models
      were posed with such insouciantly hieratic and
      meaningless attitudes -was it Alexandria, Cuzco,
      Pompeii? under the Sphinx, in Bombay, Rio de Janeiro,
      Teheran, Odessa, St. Peter's Square, at the Lincoln
      Memorial, or Nassau, under St. Paul's dome, in
      Bangkok, Nome, Alaska, on Hawaii's black sand
      beach, Wall Street or San Diego or the Free Market
      of Hongkong, Singapore, Montreal, Copenhagen, the
      Midsummer Fjords, and so forth... places, places, perpetual
      recollections of the geography of advertising! or
      are they actually only facsimiles
      of sunlight faked up against the studio wall with
      artificial architecture and the false luxury of the
      patina of ancient props which makes anything authentic-
      or, some other time altogether, between the locker/
      room and the barbecue pit, maybe while musingly
      shaking the last two spoons of Bromo Seltzer out of
      the famous blueglass bottle, or, late again for the
      party and rummaging for the missing cufflink, or
      while waxing the fishline in the springtime (in autumn
      greasing the heavy boots, also sorting cartridges),
      or, it might well be, slumping dazed in the barber'
      chair without your glasses and unable to see what's
      been done, or mulling the odds changing constantly
      up there on the board as the line moves up too
      easily toward the betting window, or, after the
      last drink, fumbling for the elusive hatcheck, or
      sometime between the fantastic hors d'oeuvres and
      the terrified glances of hostess and host as the
      evening is chewed relentlessly and swallowed down
      in boredom boredom boredom! during, if it may be
      suggested, that inevitable prolonged moment when
      your life ascends irretrievably to the outer cold and
      falls into the fixed trajectory of the permanent
      orbit and reality retreats whirling below and
      behind, its weight dragging at you with a force of
      5 to 15 G's and pressing the multiplied tons of your
      own existence against your chest like the final remorse,
      and, as you thence become separated once and forever
      from your own old self, able to view it all and yet
      unable to distinguish anything whatsoever in its particular
      homely details, which in any case always revealed far too
      much: when, in short, in short it is finally too late and
      history is all there is left to you and illumination
      comes out of the infinite black depth and you know
      that there was no way to have known that what you
      somehow knew, somehow knew, was really accurate and
      true...and then it is that that appalling dream
      suddenly comes back, that dream which woke you
      even from the heavy sleeping arms of your beloved...
      blue and red and white flames glinting and
      glaring on the midnight's horizon like silent
      slow explosions: a couple of old dolls flung
      seeming grotesquely alive in the corner of
      the dusty room, words and phrases uttered in
      the air, raucous wild syllables breaking out
      of the cackles and growls, sentences spilling
      into threats and moans and futile supplications
      as if one had suddenly but irrevocably abandoned
      the world one had made... do you com-
      prehend this? one's own created world! which
      had seemed so bad, so ugly and untrue -- but,
      perhaps, only because it was one's own?
Youth was his fountain, the world round.
He'd sail out, command a starved crew,
conquer realms, colonize the night:
he'd leap ashore in battle suit,
brain casqued in steel, fists bared to dawn,
and open simple colloquy
with eternity's nude natives,
bellowing, I, Conquistador!

But he wakes, pinioned and fettered,
in some ravine whose sandstone floor
takes no print of the silent camp
where dromedaries like shaggy ghosts
humped with silver in the moonlight
kneel about him, wheezing, sighing,
their bestial breathing the mutter
of a host of sorry spirits.

He smells the rank odor of force.
No, he thinks, a mere dream ofdeath.
This is not that sleep of all sleeps,
not demons, these hooknosed Arabs
who smoke incessant cigarettes
from cuppedfingers of slender hands...
these are men, living men, not djinn --
I'll wake saft in a burst ofsun!

But on he sleeps, this marooned man,
this imperialist of night,
ravelled in a skein of mumbo,
wrapped up in shrouds. And now he sees
that fabulous gloryglory,
his western pinnacles of power,
fall down in rose shards in his mind:
the world is round, he has returned.

They gag him as he prays for dawn,
and they truss him on a camel;
they run him (how he prays for dawn)
through the longest desert of night
to the dark interior's market:
the Emperor of Eldorado!
(who prays for dawn, though never crowned)
The Emperor! Enslaved. For sale.
Well, no one considered anything wrong:
foxy grandpa limped to his farm in the hills,
the brat fetched and carried and grew up strong,
we slept with her maids, she slept with her chills.

Love costs money, we said, what good's delay?
We dined and we danced, played at arms, shot craps
and spent our few good years like a spring day.
We welcomed strangers for we feared no traps.

You know what happened, they teach it in schools:
we paid for discourtesy with our lives:
love is faithful and we -- were a pack of fools.

It may save you running, so let's get it straight:
there are two nowheres: here, where man arrives
and there, where he pursues a withering mate.
As his old marrow clotted in his loins
he tottered. Shadows crossed the air, a smell of musk
cloyed the day -- these last hours jangled like coins.
He wept. He thought he'd creep into the dusk
because all his sons were lost: dead in piles,
or dying; ravens flopping down on husks
of busted armor; the dogs loping miles
to carrion... he'd take the barge for Avalon.
But what of the jewelled sword? Friendly smiles
meant nothing. What of the Queen? His hand on
her breast meant sons, his hand on its hilt
conquest. Better to parley than travel on,
man to man. "I would keep my power: my gilt
sword, my longthighed, milkbellied, pearbreast Queen
whose hair darkens the night. You know my guilt-
I have fidgeted the world, flubbed feasts, and seen
her stiff on her throne,whimpering in bed.
Business and drink. Now my knees quake, and green
bile stains my beard: this account is scored red
on my crusted brow. Yet still I lust: my
foot stands in the world among all these dead,
among cowards and lovers. I will not die!"
What was desire -- Dido bawling from the cliffs,
her general mulling fresher conquests,
that gorgeous insipidity -- has gone:
there are high heels clacking in Saskatoon;

what might be -- when little stars are great suns
in a universe too large for discourse,
lucid difficulties like adult poems,
so austere a jazz -- blinds in this shadow;

what is -- neither convoy nor residence,
nothing remembered, nothing found -- we have:
our wish, engineered climate, draftsman's walls,
and our life, single minds in double beds.
The old man is tired.Those insurance men
who sold him life with policies are dead.
He paid them out, he gathers interest now,
and scrawls his memoirs in the blank ledger.

There were women. Their bones fill his gray bed.
He thinks he has them yet like ghosts whose breath
is soft as his. All his snows have melted
in the same sun each year. He does not sleep.

He learned what there was to learn, left doubts room,
even reached this uninhabitable coast:
what were limits to him? But I'm his child.
I'll pay my own way, thanks. I'll bury him.
Below the tree lines
love runs its rank course
in hungry diligence
and all are slaves, none free,
pack wolves prowl through pines
but pure ways of force
suit lone intelligence:
these peaks belong to me.

Here is no men's dust
to soil the white sun
for no men know such noons,
creatureless, filled with light,
where the ice kills lust
on rocks beings shun:
such tracts polish dulled moons
and gratify the night.

Men's need for others
cannot look above
where giants in the snow
walk free and live apart:
I have no brothers
to command my love,
the grimmest winds that blow
will never touch my heart.
The doors of Numa's Arcade hang open,
and these hordes press through our dreadful Forum
where broguing Duffy, conscripts' chaplain,
shoulders and brow shagged with pigeon droppings,
broods in the sanctum of The Great White Way,
mastiff/toothed and parsing his bronze prayers:
Flesh is bread, blood is wine. Lay mine altar!
Dominus, you who ate your god in bogs,
cannons' Canon, whose masses your Mass,
Father ours: shall these drunken demos live?

I take my chance where all is rigged, like chance,
and slip a nickel in the thumbworn slot.
Round me rabid Pokerino rages,
"King of Hearts! Queen of Hearts! Who wins this hand?"
Wild soldiers shoot at waddling wooden ducks.
The Knave of Hearts turns up, and the house wins.
It's cold. Hawkers of horns baa in the snow.
What of the future? Would this machine know?
My coin drops: amber bulbs buzz and flicker:
an old bellows wheezes astral music.

In the ancient blue flaked mirror I see
my dead uncle: Java Man: trepanned skull.
He holds my hand out and takes his message.
Once more the word made new he cannot read:
YOUR ANALYSIS little concentration
you have temperament your moods too deep
quick to change intolerant lovable
abilitypersonalitymentality poor
your life can be guided subconscious ly
you should have faith you will die
Bafflement for bafflement. It is just.
I join the throngs of frozen revelers.
Under dense low clouds boiling red and blue,
mounted on marquees, waiting midnight's knell,
technicians garbed in flyer's dress scan us
televising to an unsleeping world
how time in tumult takes its harshest turn:
pale pimpled boys and patchy painted girls
laugh, yell, scream, blat Bronx Cheers from tin trumpets,
lope by flourishing pints of cheap whiskey.

I cross to Duffy's Rock in the traffic.
Beneath his silence a bum harangues us:
"Augh! Men of mine, women! Be warned by me:
time is, time was, but time is not to be!
Isle of shining towers, stones ofManhattan,
steel, glass, you happy peoples of the North:
the day has passed, the hour comes!" Who hears him?
He's drunk, he's blind, he's old and feeble.
He slumps, drooping to his derelict's doze.
Some hand stuffs a scrawled note in his stiff claws.
I give the prophet my chocolate bar
and some cold pennies (Lincoln and Legend),
in exchange for this last poor chance writing.
It reads: go get 68 West 36 Street!
wants to kill me and father who's decent
give me my things from his crime morgue room shop
212 West 110 Street holding my bankbook
stop him interfering with my life
get the unsane to attack me in Harlem
pleasure to die from 120 Street B'way crimes

Now it comes: death strikes like birth! Eyes up, all!
As if tomorrow brought yesterday's hope
above, around, among, within their eyes
seas of dulled stars anticipate chaos
roaring like the last clocks and the first
with a noise as of mobs roaming and lost
confusion triumphant in their joyful praise
without this fated drifting gray despair
burdening even the silent old stones
but passing away, but passing away
You have brought me to a despair deeper than poetry...
To have forgotten poetry!

I should sing a song of remorse to you
That you may cry Well done!
And hang your stone around my neck...

This is what you are:
Settled comfortably in the suburbs of mortality
Not interested in birds without wings
Having no expectations of honesty
     (telling the truth you lie most of all)
Dependent on bureaucrats for information
Your secular joys are secretly shameful
You did not leave a space blank for holiness
You have weak ankles you fear to challenge fate
     (unlike certain reckless skeletons we knew
     whose bones, hung in the wind, are musical)
You are so careful you take vitamins and prudent exercise
In your old age you will think of nothing but lecheries!

Small loves, I denounce you!
Your advertisements and all your friends
Your knowledge of the score-provincial gregariousness

You are always camping somewhere:
On shaking hands properly or dressing in good taste
On current events, the corrida, silent German films, ritual guilts
On clever jobs, with or without futures, or on Fellowships
On the American Musical and editing good books
Amateur skills like exotic cooking exquisite cabinetmaking collecting
On very wellpaid regional directorships raising money for humanity
On Etruscan Byzantine Ceylonese Han Navajo scholarship
Camping on Bohemia, on destitution, on an income
East and West Coast jazz sodalities
Dealing in abstract art, temple/dancing, gamehunting with cameras
On being beautiful
On selling reproductions in museums or tickets at airline desks

On sonnets and villanelles
On drug addiction and on God, prayer even!
You small loves, you camp on heterosexuality, on homosexuality
     and on marriage too!
On certain beaches in Spain
On the undiscovered retreats of the French avant/garde
     in the South of France --
Wherever it might have been interesting to go or be.

Small loves, I renounce you!
I won't get drunk at your party or keep Siamese cats...

What is it like on the Flying Dutchman
Where is the country of love
Where you come groaning
Without pity for my nakedness?
Once to wake proud in a burst of sunlight
as bearing news of real significance,
to risk cold coffee for that native hour,
unembarrassed at much cruel rapture
and clothed with an astonished nakedness
the other animals must remember:
those brunts of darkness in the opened eye
which must accept all the retributions
called justice, called civilizing peace;
to know that moment, pleasure of action,
of a world swayed by irrelevant tides
where men scorn beds made simply for sleep,
is life at a high price, without napkins,
minus the morning's editorial,
an unimaginable selfrespect
of the very young and the very old:
those who fear discipline as they fear death.
An impossible hairpin curve
the guardrail recently smashed --
we stopped there and picnicked

We had only an hour, love
there is never another time, or place
still, how useful to recall it now

The dark, deep, boulderstrewn gorge
and down down, so white and hard and swift and loud,
the foaming cataract!

And then, love, from the high, rough road
winding out at last (but too soon!)
to see that populous valley in the dusk

And to find the neon beds all taken
(though there wasn't one we could have afforded)

And so driving on all night, smoking, thinking
the car bringing us, eventually, to such different places
She came across the seas steerage class
in her middle age, past childbearing
her husband sinking into dotage
having sired two males upon her
and seven girls, none of them grateful
for her services as cook and char.

Her husband gone, at seventy-five
she had a hard stroke but was redeemed
by that young doctor who tapped her spine
and drew offin a pint of fluid
the troubling clot -- so that she lived on
blind in one eye, deafened, rather weak.
Another fifteen years she survived
uselessly dimming in the poor corners
of a household her last two daughters
destroyed by their ignorant furies,
lapsing incontinent, a burden
had she known it even to herself.

She endured her perishing a week:
bothered three days with what seemed a cold,
pausing one night to let them bicker,
Who'd buy drugs? Who'dpay doctors? Her costs!
and slipping three days slowly, slowly,
toward those rattling rasping sighs, and death.
She was through yet she wasn't finished:
consigned that hour to morticians
her hamper of flesh and bent old bones
were zipped up in a green canvas sack
and bundled off -- as they wept a tear
for mother, and two more for themselves.

On the next day at twelve/thirty sharp
she reappeared in Chapel C, West,
in a plain coffin of good grade oak
to be viewed by mourners where she lay
dressed in raw muslin, washed and powdered
and neatly stitched: she seemed someone else.

A short service for this old stranger
THE FIFTH COMMANDMENT'S IMPLICATIONS
CONCERNING FILIAL OBLIGATIONS
delivered by a rented rabbi
in a spate of Buchenwald Yiddish,
broken Hebrew and passport English.

And then that sleek new Cadillac hearse
driven by a rakish/capped chauffeur
who wears aviator's sunglasses
and knows the fast route across the Bronx
over the Triborough Bridge to Queens
out expressways to the granite gates.

It's a glorious Spring afternoon,
three robins dispute this hunting ground,
that man speaks his mangled speech, O God!
and the sandy loam is shoveled back
tactlessly neutral, filling the hole
making my brother's nose twitch with fear.

As the family turns toward the cars
he points at the Queens College buildings
beyond the graveyard's west wall and says
"Next Fall when I'm admitted I'll drive
to campus over the Whitestone Bridge"
and I say "Taking Humanities?"
           No world but this for your eye:
      space without nebulae, comets,
   neither cosmic dusts, stars, gas, debris,
nor, nearer, planets, sun, moon, cloud, hill, plain,
trees, birds-nothing inhuman to stir pain
   and make us love what eyes learned to see
      when forepaws left their rude comments
           on things, saying X was I.

           No world but this in your space:
      where all is free, where being's forms,
   born of human force, live from your act
of grace in spectrums unknown to God's white,
thrive in space like souls passing time when light
   strikes fractured glass, sand, paint smeared and tracked
      by palette knife-such random storms
           whirled over your human face

           as never racked God's creatures.
      Who can commit you then to God
   when all things are His but yours, Jackson,
who to say, "Sandy cemetery clay
holds this broken drunken artist whose play
   was work, work splash of bitter lakes on
      silent unsized canvas where good
           and bad never have features

           as in God's world of moral things,
      God's numbers not at last nameless,
   sexual, violent, or skillful
as you were in those desperate movements
of your times at work, at play, those moments
   bourbon, breasts, brush made living artful
      and so self/willed, dying aimless
           and unmindful of God's real things?"

           Won't someone ask, when flowers
      dropped by Kline, de Kooning, pale wife
   and fifty ranking abstract friends wilt
on your new grave and funeral turns wake,
wake floats toward next weekend, when for your sake
   flesh becomes void again, denied, killed
      for love of something in this life
           called art, "Are all man's hours

           zeroed like yours in God's eye
      and ours in yours, Jackson, useless
   colored space minus natural line,
naked spirit's elaborate gestures
knowing nothing in truth but these vestures
   of itself in its own masculine,
      own feminine, with no address
           but this home in time, this I?"
The follies of the Sanhedrin prepared
us for innocence: a high August sun,
shore of broken conches emptied of flesh
by local synods of gulls, this tumult
of waters patched now blue, now gray, now black,
swashing about surf-fishers' knees. Like posts
they stand, casting, reeling, casting, reeling,
roughdressed, rawhanded, stubblefaced, staring
at the blank stretch of sea, while behind them
flies quarrel over scraps of stinking bait.

Even God deserts his echoes: silence
confounds the drone of antique deliberations
whose heavens were harsher than life: dismissed,
our elders trudged to their tabernacles
in the moral fires, leaving us this world.
Is it strange to be content to be hopeless?
Consider burrowing nations of clams,
or fat porgies scrounging those taut fish lines.
We have no answers: questions need we none:
Though marrow is not nectar, call it bilge?

Grant concessions to animus, oh sure,
one glance shows the dumb fury of this Point:
rocks plunging awash, a tide'bitten beach,
the necessary lighthouse at the end,
monstrous squalls and human desolation.
So, we're paupers staring east at zero...
Yet grant too this bland hour's better than most:
we sit near the good and the true, smoking,
talking our jargon. Out of the welter
we plucked breath, and a pail full of beach plums.
Eve is angel, though bone of bone. She is
the wealth of women, she makes my garden
love's maze, all flesh and fruit: the sweat of bliss
is dew upon our bellies. She is the warden
of this world, and its colors speck her eyes
as richest soil her hair. Fear can't harden
her heart, silver under breasts of gold: cries
from dispossessed night burnish her sweet sleep.
Yet I hear you from Eden, where wind sighs
over the ruined metropolis, where you keep
vigil in that waste, mounting your old tower
to watch deserts of stars, count dead moons, and weep
the dust from your eyes. Even here this hour
is yours, Lilith, my demon wife before time,
like my years before the sun, my power
knotted in your long black hair. Steps that climb
to Eden lead down again. Heirs of blood
may walk in the shade with Eve, giants prime
yoking the mammoth mountains to her good
will and farming men in her big daughters.
They may stretch their dominions over the flood
of time, and crown Eve mother of waters-
but, Lilith, your song rises from the stones' curse
at night, and I turn to hear you. No laughters
of sons, no wife from my bone, can drown your voice.
Regime falls on regime, a flood of stones
pounding the horse plains, burying strangers
and beloved together in the cause
of no community and of no life
but one: the way of flags, standards of death
displayed by hordes riding always without hope.

Scorned, denied, banished from today, the hope
of thought broken where these broken stones
crush the choked, smoking streets: a place of death,
children killing, children killed by strangers,
no quarter for thought: yet hope still, still life
makes way among the ruins and seeks a cause.

Killing or killed, we will not yield our cause
to them nor they to us, there is no hope
of settling the ways of passion with life:
out of old ways come civil streets and stones
to pave and build, but out of life strangers
with fire hot in their hands come bringing death.
Ungentle then these crossroads, filled with death,
enfiladed from all sides in no cause,
to no end: we foreign and they strangers
firing in darkness and blind with the hope
that sunlight lights the others heaped on stones,
that hatred's nights no longer rake this life.
Stairs blasted, riddled walls, the garden's life
of peace unhonored by gardeners whose death
is sowed and reaped with force among these stones:
on every hand neglect: neglect of cause,
ends neglected while time wastes and dear hope
rots with neglect... a waste where strangers

wander unmeeting, avoiding strangers
who will ask alight, for the time: Your life,
your life, give us whateveryou would hope
to have or save or take :you are lost,your death
is here, now,forever, and for your cause
you shall die and be buried under stones!

What is fit for stones is fit for strangers:
our only good cause going from the life
where men find death, where slaves can only hope.
Once again, undressing for bed late that night, we
looked shyly at each other in anticipation of the joy
wandering the nearest landscape one knows, perhaps
expecting the calm rest that belongs to fortunately-
settled natives. We were shocked to see the bloated
bellies of long starvation!

Then, as the moon went out and we tossed in sleep in
the darkness, what did we hear? A scurrying of
timid ground~dwellers, chipmunks, mice, rabbits,
foxes; whirring of wings beating among the forest
leaves; cracklings and crashings of deer and bear
through the dense brush? We thought them mythical
premonitions...

Human contours remain the last anfractuosities for
the ambitious explorer. Let him be warned in advance
of his researches: in the dark -- let him consider
this -- in the dark, and with the clock pressing
more loudly at his ear, what exactly will he be able
to put his hands on? Even he who is most attentive
to intimate processes is afraid to contemplate this sudden
record of catastrophe. Erosion,
drowned chasms, uplifting of the very roots of the
range -- those long-hidden Cambrian basalts lying naked
when the sun struggles through the
thin smoky curtain of consciousness. What must have
been successive and profound temblors: to have gone
unnoticed! Only then did we realize what a delusion
our hopes of breakfast were...
Away with that tradition of wretched glory
Sustained by the memory of certain deep caresses
That dream of lovers, and enemies- to have each other!

Wealth upon wealth! your charity impoverished me...
Was it right, was it good, to seek our humanity?
Alert, but wisely blind, like mirrors engaged: a nightmare!

Because your solicitude gave me what I wished
Oh my friend, may my generosity plunder you
Surfeit drown you, burn you, leave you to my death!

Forms emptied, momentary purity, each from each, unbound
And then, breakfasting on carbon, to find our equivalents,
Pleasures exquisite and black sentiments-obscure concentrations!

Yet to take, forget, take again and, unremembering, take once more!
I measure you with my fingers, and these estimations begin. Endless!
As if to understand, to accomplish ourselves, or become happy!
Poisoned, by our own lips! That exchange of eloquence...
Having worshiped too long in the same place-that radiance!
Our theory decayed into hard passions, perishing bits

Except the work to be done, nothing true can be known
Flesh parallel with flesh, ourselves merely the objects of force
As if love alone were precious! Now do you comprehend government?

Hence we joined, entering this silent momentum of things
Was it to resolve chastity that we opened our eyes in the dark,
Yielding tender as stoics to the mutualities of conquest?

All things are joyous but joy, whose kisses are blows
Compressed, heavy, durable-broken matters come to earth at last
Thus we grew human, having abandoned nothing but life

Yet, enlarged and preyed on by tomorrow, we will be hungrier
Rally the despairing fractions, command them to this new world
So that, iron ringing in our bones, we shall seem admirable killers!
You gave them all the dances, but came home with me
Then we bathed, and anointed each other with true lies
You showed me fields in the sea: I promised wild, honest tigers

To have torn ourselves away, lost them everywhere around us
Miracle! aspiring yet again and only to such nakedness!
They will say we lacked compassion, like survivors

Neither mine nor yours the courtesy of rotten states
Their archives burdened by the news of perpetual disasters
Absurd communities, cities rooted in our very hearts-gone!

Having destroyed ourselves and risen, ourselves once more
We drink this wine, resting content in the fruitful, bright mirage
Wanderers, come here! Green and gay, the world without hate or love

There, those shadows whirl grasping their possession, alive as ghosts!
But remember, remember we are real, it is no dream --
Soon we die, embracing and alone -- remember we have lost nothing.
         To pass inhuman barriers
      heroes were by ancient ritual
  brought most bloody forth from loins ripped wide
in bestial labor: they sprung from childhood
joy and fell in virgin manhood
  on divine traps: strange deaths stained their pride
      with glory grim yet natural
         to men lacking man's terrors.
         Leave them in myth where they lie,
      destroyers of all decency,
  brave but in excess, as though God's wilds
were gardened rich without domestic tools
or flesh home enough: who today is fooled
  past what tested powers prudence wields?
      No man knowing love leaves men, he
         fears that hero's wish to die.
         (Icarus, that callow youth,
      that amateur doomed in contempt
  of the laws of motion, comes to mind:
beeswax and feathers ruined by the sun
to adorn the maxims that kept Greek sons
  down on the farm, on foot, with their kind-
      are heavens heaven when attempts
         on heights reach but to such truth?)
         Captain Apt: no hero found
      in legend falls with such a fall,
  bound unwarned, unwilling, unmade for death,
professionally cautious every day,
a family man needing his week's pay
  though working beyond life's reach where breath
      takes thought, where his something is all,
         and nothing's silence surrounds.
         Those who came back from such flight
      do not talk with heroes' accents
  of what they know: Chuck Yeager the bold,
aging Gene May, restless Bill Bridgeman and
one who broke through first and died, de Havilland:
  that tremorless high arc, still and cold,
      Mach 3 on twenty/mile ascents,
         that peace of most intense light,
         and that flameout at the top,
      weightlessness, shadow/blotched dials,
  null trim/control: that long loathed drop down
buffeting, burning, shattering through air,
plunged worse than the damned falling in despair,
  that deadstick landing on native ground,
      that fearful gearing for new trials:
         a day's work that never stops.
         Such means mean ends: you perished
      in the name of power and life
  on routine assignment, testing walls
of shock, of heat, testing blood bone and metal,
force on naked force that we may settle
  squatter's claims on God's desert that calls
      the soul as man is called to wife:
         that children may be cherished
         amid universal storms,
      that cabins may grow to towers,
  tribes to nations rampant who shall find
solace paving boulevards of empire
which run past all barriers to desire
  and plant on barren worlds the strong mind
         that loves love's domestic powers,
         love's homemaking human forms.
The giant blooms amidst green damnation,
swollen ecstasies of this timeless realm,
elegant, unblessed. Old hothouse roaches
trot along lianas on their roach affairs.
Hot, hot beneath glass, the dour pineapple
and the sweetish lemon, greengold and thinskinned,
ripening sans honor: athletes and esthetes.
Fat frogs squat steaming in bowers of blood
and tumorous copper carp fin idly
at the conduit. There is nothing but life.

There is nothing but life but love. The pyre,
the searing mantle, the egg in embers,
the new pinions, a hundred years of youth:
earth, air, water, the greenhouse sun at noon:
all heaven in a pot: Adam virgin
brooding in his sterile zoo. But when she comes
swanking to his couch the dust lusts
in the desert and time begins society:
the sun runs, the moon is pregnant with stars:
under domes of glass there is laughter.

They stroll on tidy paths, flesh. Nimble Jack
and Nimble Jill in the hothouse jungle:
their fathers kings, and queens their mothers.
They walk, they talk. They sit, they smoke, and they kiss.
Lovers laugh at rumblings in the bush:
cities rise new in their arms, their arts conquer men:
there is no other choice but to love.
Old closing time shoos them kindly. Outside
it is snowing. Their selves of laughter meet
their tears. There is nothing but love but death.
You said, How strange! Among all who have come by, only
you guessed my name. Hardly. I could not have done
otherwise. And now, what is mine?

No matter where it fell, the seed must do its best to become
its unknown self. If you believed morality necessary too,
consider the agony of the plant: its only life, desire.

That permanent diet they forced on us -- how young we
were! Some warm room, food enough, a few cigarettes,
and everywhere in our thoughts those loudspeaking
communities instructing us. By such dry passions they
obliged us to persist, despite everything, in the one
direction: towards life.

Thronged streets, people whispering, What? What? Pale
swaths of filmy radiance, ivory, rose, chartreuse, ozone blue,
sweeping overhead though not dimming the stars: the Northern
Lights! Before dawn a total eclipse of the sun, calculated
how many scores of years ago, would surely begin, eastward
over the Atlantic. The great age must be near.We waited,
heroic as lampposts. Clocks ticked loudly, then softer
again: sighs of married sleepers. Also, through the
short, hot night, the thrilling noise of shattered
glass-windows, bottles. Barriers and containers.
That perpetual sedentary economy! Well, but if you cared
you could manage for a few years, living together like a
family. Yet when it came, on whom would the sun shine?
Oh my dear hope, how frightened you are.

As for thought -- plunged like an aging actress in her
barbituric pool. Darkness, and talk was misery; it filled
the ashtrays. In awhile, the tide at full, men would be
concentrating on charts held unrolled beneath the sufficient
glow of their binnacles. Business and pleasure: always
somewhere to go and a way to get there. Yet as though
hopeless, we brewed another pot of coffee. You could
almost feel the waters start on ebb. We knew what was
happening to us: it is never the first time for those who can
remember their birth.

You were taught one of the histories, and so you take the
huge vagary of the present for granted. My faith in
nothing, not even in what I do (my show of life!) makes
you anxious. You wish me to possess you, just as you
need to possess me. You even survey and dig into
tomorrow: you suppose that buying an old well'built
house and moving it to your own new foundation where you
can overlook this dairygreen valley in which farmers fought
side by side with Indians will bring us to America. All
right, then what? You'll only see me there, mowing the
lawn again. Maybe I stop, go to the ragged screen of privet
to peer through. Maybe I've glimpsed the shadow of
ruin moving once more in Mr. Wester's tall August hay,
careless as the black bear who slouched through sumac
at the bottom of the meadow. A tremor. You will recall
what a surprise our meeting was, too. Springs flowing
in one eon, in another not...

One need only want to join those who have imagined the true
change of season to understand that space and time exist,
and yet do not. For each one of those thousand miles
separating them from that brief life lovers have
prepared a fear, each fear the thought that stops them, and,
stopped, they stand forever contemplating the killing distance
that lies beyond the next step. Look, the first piece of gravel
I pick up from my driveway reveals a fossil snail!

For we have no destiny at all! This planet spins on, fixed
in a lucky orbit. The single stars themselves, which we
resolve as clusters of random, dimming universes, drift
nowhere. Dreading your reply, I said, Where do you want
to go? It was what I expected, the only one: With you.

As long as the car was moving, whatever we said made sense.
And whenever we stopped for the night it seemed useless to
utter anything but the common syllable of endearments.

Day and night, the diesels of the combines roaring. Cutting,
husking, threshing, baling, bagging, loading, they disappear
over the flat bluegray horizon, following their compasses
north/by/northwest. High summer. The spume of their
exhausts, grayblue, tinges the haze. Up in the sky swifts
and swallows careen; redwinged blackbirds tilt on the
fenceposts; crows cross cawing at dusk and dawn. There is
no such thing as America -- only the plowing up, the plowing
under. So that our lives are like all those yesterdays:
before and after the orange and yellow squads of combines.

Because there is neither digression nor return, but
merely cessation, we remembered to kiss goodbye.
Once on the way we perceived strangers everywhere,
in everything terror. Had we abandoned our life
for what was barely possible? Yet it would have been wrong
to protect ourselves. For later, in that standard and
familiar rented American room, helpless in the net of the
deepest embrace, we cried out to each other, spontaneously,
But who are you!
But I want you to understand
I find myself here to be known
Just as out back this piece of land
Waited ten years lying grassgrown

I myself an arm of no race
To stoop like that first settled man
And touch and probe this fallow place
To make it give me what it can

I revealed it like an old chest
Covered with books and webs of dust
Stripping it bare as my wife's breast
I pondered its promise and my lust

Tumultuous vegetables
Green striving, beans, corn, peas, it's true:
Nourished loves create our fables
Innocent powers, I've found you!

That was one of my morning dreams --
As if plenty were life, were all
To have to know to do clay's themes --
That was wisdom before the Fall

When light fails these mad weeds come through
My rows groan, deformed: ah poor patch!
Like my nightmare I feel cold dew
As if I could bear it I'll watch

Mumbling monster rabbit who creeps
Full and silver magnificence
My gardened human folly sleeps:
I'm here for my deliverance!

Haunting the lives of all you glide
Murdering owl, who know the worst
Bring us truth wherever we hide
In hunger and hope we die cursed

Yet may we rest safe and rest well
May I not hear the rabbit's scream
And waking to dawn's mist not tell
How I died waiting in my dream
Our lives are not renewable, yet we seek extinctions.
The effort needed to subdue and suppress that wise
fear, that monstrous tenacity of nature in us which
protects us from ourselves! What do we hope to
discover in disaster: further cycles
of growth, perhaps achieving the new capacities...?
Is that why I betrayed
you? Everywhere. In everything. As we ate and slept.
Even before our long spring began, when the sun came
back with fresh light and winds out of the south
breathed upon the black sodden valley, recreating
grass and the blossoms as though from memory. It was all
food. We were promiscuous as bees. Yet I was always
alone, aspiring toward my own fulfillment. In our
common acts of love most of all. And you?

Leaves drooping coated with red dust. Confused by
the humid glare of an overcast afternoon sky, the
wild bees swarm irritably. The yellow hay has
finally stopped growing; waist-high it stands
waiting the mower. What was that long season of
flowering but time's metaphor? Errors ripen now,
impersonal as our joys -- those accidents and
brief coincidences in which matter clings to matter
like the touches of love. And the seeds scattering,
somewhere to overcome us: the same things returning,
inexorably full of themselves. We should have
known, expected it. But how?

Sitting by the road I watch the cars. Their passage
raises the clayey dust that chokes the leaves.We
have conquered this narrow strip of space in which
all are born. But what are those blank impassive
faces people show? They pretend to hide
our secret: that we go everywhere and come to nothing,
that even in the necessary and lucky exchanges of
pollen which preserve the world yesterday robs us
of tomorrow.

So that we must destroy our lives because life has
destroyed us. Burning ways random as our unknown,
equivocal desires through time, that abyss of silence.
Imagine it, through time!

I can spot where the bees are at work in the hollow tree
finishing their graywalled, goldfilled
catacombs. The thinning coarsened foliage dies out,
stiffens, blackish/green. In expectation of the suns
of coming years, our cousins the living things have
increased themselves and multiplied. Now they
halt: they will wait, without the vanity of hope: and
they will survive their own deaths. But we, driving,
driving, do not slow-although when we are gone,
in a month, in a year, who will claim the strange
harvest of this incessant wintry assault upon ourselves?
One could not want a clearer season, when things age but
   do not grow, time fit for true meditations
the stained white house thrown up by summer's storm, stranded,
   abandoned on this crisp crackling backwash of brown leaves
all the birds asleep, huddled away from the frost owl, or flown
   whence their seasonal imperatives direct
and that gibbous moon, gleaned of color, dull as the rimed stooks,
   rocking on a porch of Prussian blue.

I, however, do not sit in the dark looking out at this
   transparency, this quasi-philosophical Kodachrome,
but by a bright light ponder, considering next week's lectures,
   and think what I shall not say:
supposing Poe sober-sane, Hawthorne utterly mad, both, like myself,
   uxorious, in love with necessity
and up against it, its rigors and crotchets, etcetera, baffled by
   will and desire, baffled oh by right answers.

But it is very hard to think, because the flies have gone berserk,
   buzzing buzzing buzzing
they beat against my clean ceiling, where in consternation have
   they come from! and bash bash bash
indiscriminate, even for Musca domestica, beating about the bulb,
   caroming off the shade,
like spitballs whizzing, hopped-up like protons in a cyclotron,
   they crack against my face -- and cling.

Ugh! it's not just the October chill has set this fly circus
   aswarm in crazy orbits --
their controls are shot, reckless senility misguides them,
   desperate, into these centrifugal throes:
unpredictable even to themselves, how can one stalk October flies!
   chaos! it is maddening!
yet, with calculated indirection, rather nonchalant, feigning
   purposelessness, I hunt these distractions down.

What I do, I clap hands over them as they sit-Hai! Hai! with
   a kind of Zen finesse --
they fall, stunned it would seem into thought, moreover still
   sufficiently alive for it,
wherefore, much against my better nature, I pull the brittle wings
   to calm the last agony
indeed to help them through their black October passage in dry
   meditation, as it were.

And for myself endeavor to give thanks for this their pestiferous
   excruciation (oh it is a sign!)
because, reckless, jumpy, despairingly unpredictable and
   buzzing beating bashing
I too make myself generally a nuisance unto God Who in this
   same night of Fall sits, alone,                                                        j
pondering a sensible rhyme for His Own Name -- to give thanks
   I say, that, distracted, He clap not His Hands!
You! whom the aged brandy does not burn
Cold lecher forcing technical boundaries
Dayblind, nightcalm, though bubs and bellies storm
Last judge of international anatomies
And you! sublime tricks breeding such quandaries
Smooth contraceptive eye, knee, lip, thigh
All contestants universal beauties
Quarrelling fuel, frantic for light

You! angels abroad weathering those abysms
Beyond me far as I transgress my natural
Having mounted beneath that hail of kisses
On perpetual stairs (dismal after the funeral)
And you too, her sonorities, thought infernal
You demand the bridge-the bridge, not seamen
And men for those hips undismayed though autumnal
Long hair, long laughter, and her cruel pleased mind

You, fluorescent in midnight blizzard! I see, I know!
Orbed bane striding through slush, spiritual beast
Rings of violet flaming as eyes, bare bleached brow
Hungry mouth of blue teeth, those sucked'out breasts
Naked ankles strapped on killing heels, such slut's taste
Beaked nose, clanging wrists, and hands bejewelled
Gaunt in black crepe, a satin-sashed grim cocktail dress
You! ponderable there so terribly tall

Is it you? So, it's you! "Hag, accuse, bless!"
Silent on she comes pointing that harpy's manicure
The car stalls Drunk Igiggle and retch "Blast!
O you! Hybrid! Roar, bitch! Make me-pure!"
        He himself suffering and starved
        He did not rain bread on me
        In ignorance begat me
        Cursed each way each way enslaved

        Unborn my mother killed him
        As my wife who loves me now
        And I beget children now
        In silence like his so damned

        Denying not nor affirmed
        Father such deaths as men live
        In pain continue to live
        Unconsoled unreformed

        Blood consumed secluded heart
        Who fought joys calloused by love
        Who thought forgiving true love
        Forgive me my love you feared

        And believe your ravaged breast
        And forget our chains of hope
        And reconcile without hope
        And reside restless at peace
She sorrowed because she pleased
While spring gave no more than sons
Her terrors born at her breast
Lost pursuing her poor moons

She wanted no wish but love's
Betrayed by trusting that truth
His flesh hers now in us moves
Perfections unknown by both

She was strong without wisdom
Her sons would take light from God
Mirrors that folly lives in
Returning horrors for good

She fought hard but we broke her
For we proved human as stones
Her fouled thighs tremble in fear
And we shall preserve her ruins

She knew no bliss but pain's way
Though hate bonds too like love's vow
Love brings all strangers all joys
Neither love nor hate we know
Love here whatever love declares is love:
   Life undressed like winter elms is dressed like life
   Beauty preponderant yet masked by beauty
   Design made glad and doomed and mad with design
   Stones beneath snow, gray clouds above: beyond,
   the flesh of stars is stone
Flesh bitter as the sea though kissed and bathed
   by sweet flesh
Truth believed like death which lives betrayed by truth
   Unknown the seeker, who finds nothing but what is
   unknown:
She, she names me: I come, I pray, I know, I name!
   but is it she?

Drive north from the city two hours, 
past the appropriate ridges and through 
the obligatory tunnel that cowers 
under the mountain. Hawks that flew 
solicitously near the roadside mowers 
return to their own named peak to view 
without judgment your entrance. Ask the powers 
of light and shadow to reveal the blue onion bulbs of the true 
Ruthenian Church amid wildflowers 
and steep vetch. Wind back as if you knew
by heart Cyrillic names of miners -- sowers 
of canonized fern and weed, and renew 
the threefold Byzantine Rite, as summer showers 
stream down and a yellow halo of mist to surround
the town rises slowly from the burning ground.

The town rises slowly from the burning ground. 
Watch the vacant homes, unsellable now, 
freshly blanched with strips of siding, the crowned 
churches, their Babel of tribal Masses below the show 
of sunlight on gold and copper; and the sky, split 
by brittle steeples. It is little grown 
from the company town -- patchwork village by the pit 
with omnipresent monument, the Breaker, flown 
like a buttress against the black mountain -- 
this the shrine of the Holy Order of Anthracite.
Though odors of bottom damp and methane 
no longer reek into the streets and ignite, 
the underground tunnels burn, and each vein 
of coal, potential fuse, leads to another domain.
It begins around the 4th of July,
you can smell the bleenies as you drive
past the Tamaqua Coal Breaker, where trees
and brush grown awry begin to patch up
the damage done to the hills, where you meet

head-on, vast troughs of lard set
on two-by-fours, tented, hoarding the cross streets.
By the Feast of the Assumption it all fires
to a feverish pitch (townspeople lined
for tickets, more pushy, prayerful,

beseeching than for the state's pick-six lottery.)
As novice priests don canvas aprons,
quick to be tainted by sizzling grease,
and (Ecce Homo!) they serve them up
in stacks of three, these wafers so rich

and life sustaining, only a Byzantine
god, forgetting his grief, could have divulged
the exact mix of ingredients. Though a certain nun,
peeling potatoes at devotions

claims the recipe is there to be heard:
When voices blend in polyphonic hymns
and the Mother of God takes the sweetest part.
We have a saying in Old Church Slavonic --
Preparing for a Feast Day is the highest Art.
Deep into the side of the mountain
we tunnel down, timbering the shaft
as we go. And when we hit the slick
black vein that straddles, upside down,
the town of Ashland, and masses up
in the convoluted bulk of Buck Mountain,
we let down the gallon pail
and rob a tiny bit of anthracite
from the hundred mile hidden spread
of the Philadelphia Coal and Coke Company,
sole owner of every foot of ground we walk on.

We are not the only ones. Holes proliferate
like minefire. The hill is covered with a pox
the company men are helpless against.
(We are all company men), brazen enough
to hitch a mule to a junk car,
weotug it uphill, park over the hole.
lacked up, the winding driveshaft
pulls up the laden bucket, while the lookout
sits inside in comfort. The old Pocono hills,
vacation land to the rest of the world,
give us back a little, what everyone else takes.
The day Christ rose from the dead
I drove upstate to the anthracite hills
out past Minersville, Coaldale, Slabtown,
till I spotted the golden cupolas
of the Lemko Church in Shenandoah:
blinding nuggets pressed from the carbon landscape,
rising atop homes and churches
of another ridge town, diminishing
and lungblack, scrubbed immaculate.

Over millennially blazing coal pits I drove,
through granulated hillsides,
by ruddy creekbeds, steaming rivulets
of the hidden Schuylkill,
vales of choking men
and a miner's bestiary: Bull-
dozers, Yellow Scoops, Longnecked Cranes,
Graders, Backloaders, Hoppers,
silenced by this day of denial,
I drive through the underworld out of which
a fossilized Christ so often rises.

And searching for the golden domes of the Lemko Church
and its icons -- yearning-eyed, idolatrous, and maternal,
I wended my way through the town's attempts at purgation:
taprooms, luncheonettes, bingo halls, polka dances,
which He, though not one to give faint praise or join in,
surely must have smiled at, secretly, amid the solemn Mass,
amid the uttered sighs of his leisurely stroll past:
Friday's suffering all but forgotten,
the taste of coal dust
barely a tickle now in His throat.
You are right, Lev Nikolayovitch;
that's the sad part of it,
sad from the very beginning.
Even as a melancholy roustabout
soldiering through the Caucasus.
Mare's milk may cure some bodily ills,
but what of that chronic disease
of untransubstantiated flesh,
which craves a vodka's nurture
or the flagellant's soothing caress?

Are the tiny notated moments --
scything through a field of rye,
cuddling children on the stove-shelf
of a peasant hut -- worth it all?
Interminable train rides, coughed up
secrets, moment's calm before
an old love makes thirst
unquenchable, only to be right
again and again, bearded and bast-sandaled
venerable and cranky.
Yes there is death and resurrection.
Yes there is change and constancy,
the gamut of gossip and gospel,
ask any old, deaf, fiddler.
The Maestro struts on stage in tight
black pants, he tips the hardware store
stool he's settled on, the score
of ocean pitches forth the night.

And helmsman, sailors, and their girls
carouse (right after lunch) and laugh
at sturm und klipp welling from staff
and line. The Maestro rashly hurls

himself into a sea that Wagner'd
have us drown in. But with a gasp
he stills the waves enough to grasp
another ship, upstage, anchored

to gloom and death and lost salvation.
He calls the whole thing off. Too slow,
he shouts, for this diminuendo.
The deathship that destroys elation.

Take five. We don't know why you're cursed,
doleful Dutchman, we've come mid-act
like you -- why nothing will distract
you from your role, too well rehearsed.

The Maestro's from Milan my box --
mates claim. The chorus finds his silly
faces charming. I think, South Philly,
catching his fingers pat the buttocks

Brushing by of lovely red-haired
Senta, whose faithful love alone
can lift the Dutchman's curse. Viols groan
regaining tune. We're unprepared

when her soprano surges to
a crest. The shock waves ripple and rake
the grand Academy, they shipwreck
the free-floating qualm that urges to

deny, deny, that we are saved,
like rescued sailors hauled to port.
I join musicians, bobbing apart,
they leave their watch, no more enslaved

to score, baton, or measured phrase
as Senta, warding off a cold,
halts her aria to unfold
a handkerchief, and so delays

this afternoon's one last refrain.
Whatever chance there was to lift
some curse now sinks or goes adrift
as horns' and woodwinds' waters drain.
Almost twenty years since my girlfriend's sister
ran off, we had to wade through a pre-dawn
spate of bodies -- fringe, leather, and sweat,
Hindu oils and acrid smoke, to ask
an ex-high school math teacher peddling
LSD, and then young runaway hillbillies,
Irish factory girls, and blacks whose
astrological signs served as names
for news of her -- cribbed-in, as we were
between highrises, the Art Alliance, Ethical
Society, Curtis Institute, funnelling breezes
into the crowded square, backdropped as if
by a huge wraparound poster
an artist of the times might have conceived.

Tonight, in the center of the square,
where in weeks a bandshell might rise,
I recognize a man I've seen a thousand
times on comers, squares, every block
party, celebration, museum terrace,
free concert, I've wandered through these twenty years.
He hasn't changed since I first spotted him --
picked out among the celebrants as not
one of the fleeting participants of the city's mysteries.
He limped, one leg shorter, and wobbled recklessly,
bulk threatening to topple even when he sat
on some bench or townhouse stoop, forever silent,
agape mouth like a text, divined, awaiting
codification: He looked lost in those
familiar places, having lost even
the reasoned sadness that released him, set
him free to scour the city. He noticed me,
I'm sure, each time. I thought him middle-aged,
though he'd transformed so little in those two decades,
I'm no longer sure he is not the reflection
of myself, caught obliquely in shop windows,
projected -- after some original astonished
glimpse of him -- out of some initial fear
that he saw me as tortured and alone
as I saw him -- or worse, that passersby,
so breezy in their elevation and style,
brushed by interchanging us in view.

Now, as dusk hardens into night,
he stands in the thinned-out park, not one of the
innumerable saviors of the universe I first
thought him to be, unpropped by the empty fish
pond and police hut. When he turns his head to face me
his whole doughy body follows, split-
second behind, and with a gentle wave
motion, before averting his eyes in a manner
I'd be forced to call coy, had he been
one of those student cellists who passed by earlier,
stirred-up, soul less burdened after a Bartok
recital -- he begins to walk.in circles,
his short leg leading him to spiral in,
in circles concentrically smaller.

I remembered that summer at the Jersey shore,
just after my girlfriend's sister ran off
and my girlfriend forgot who she truly was.
I stood on the beach with friends waiting for the moon
to slip into the night's pocket -- after
a day fighting breakers, stenches of burning
flesh, scattered parts of Leviathan
chopped-up and strewn across the beach, the feast
in which I could not take part: I too began
to wander in circles, slowed down eddy of whirlpool,
convinced, as I paced, each step, inches smaller
and angled in, that as my circle closed
upon itself more tightly and I approached
the sacred and hidden epicenter
into which all life resolved
I would no longer be visible.
Though it saddens me and causes great shame
to walk beneath the Frankford El,
I do it often now, as I did ten years ago.

And I am still an easy mark
for pigeons roosting in the bolted crevices
of the El structure, squat as the wives

of new Russian merchants blocking doorways
to fruit stands or hoagie shops, although they,
of course, are not a cause of my shame.

I remember when I first entered the canopy
of the El structure, not caring
about the subway train, here above ground and always

moving on. I sat, that first day, on the concrete
stoop of the Fidelity Bank
and spread notebooks and sacred texts

around me. I was writing a saga
called Fishtown, a piece that lacked,
unlike the El, the spiritual underpinning

capable of supporting and transporting
the living. It was then the pea-green slime
dropped on my head. In my innocence

I suspected not the doves, but the sloppy,
scaffolded painters coating the girders
that straddled Kensington Avenue. And I was outraged

that no one paid attention
when either nature or the working class
dumped on me. Although I have since

learned the difference between pigeon shit and paint,
there is always something new from the same vatic source
waiting to defeat us when we feel most sure.

Like Mrs. Sophia, the cardreader, rocking
behind her picture window, or the parading
school girls from Frankford High

or Little Flower -- named for the more delicate
Teresa, so meek and humble, whose ecstasy
never came; not from heaven, not from me.
Between the Allegheny and Tioga stops
of the Frankford Elevated Train,
a miniature mock-Georgian mansion
sits on the third story
of tarpaper and sloping asphalt fields
of unoccupied rowhouses.
The owner is never to be seen
in his split-second passage across the window,
though what little we know of mankind
shows that he raises doves or even chickens
and knows nothing of the silvery train
that rattles his coops, cracks his eggs,
and at ten minute intervals, slithers by,
attempting to shake him from his nest.
The view into the city draws us more
than the view out. Downtown riders cram the right
side, home the left. Even third floor apartment dwellers
on the west side of the tracks add to the imbalance:
spraypainted messages, flags, curtainless windows
with waving hags, propped-open exhaust ducts.
For the east is something other; past the cluster
of sandblasted churches, past refineries, docks, drawbridged
river; past reclaimed Jersey swamp, lie pine barrens,
gambling casinos, an ocean of adolescent summers,
wholly other than the city to the west;
whose alleys made labyrinthine by row homes
are brushed by the windows -- this view the child
longs for, so small, so long denied
the tops of things.
To understand the city
an archeologist would have to dig
up, through the layers of cheesy air
to find the coppery drainpipes, the not-yet-looted
shards, still intact, impossible to decipher
from the street, barely readable between stops,
the signs that have never changed. De-coding them
he'd find a different city reconstructing itself:
lush union halls, starry-eyed ballrooms, giant milkbottles,
pony stables -- place-named fish-town, fair-mountain,
hunting-downs, harrowed-gate. An archeologist,
a traveller, an artist, would have to dig upwards,
pass through the turnstyle and ride endlessly the El,
to realize how little
an angel or other functioning deity
knows of life in the city.
Next block a man bullhorns his Rosaries,
Hail Mary, full of grace crackles through
the alleyway. Drenched in their own sweet dew
the neighbors sit on stoops, await the breeze
that never stirs. And from the boarded store,
huge boxes blare Break on through, as shirtless
boys exchanging taunts without success
slurp, then stack by the gutter cans of beer.
The boredom grows more great along the block.
The toxic stench from Bridesburg incinerates
the air, now fully marbleized from pig stock-
yards. A child's punished cry lacerates
the frail gardenia stem my wife just potted.
Before I sleep I hear Pray for the Brokenhearted.
In Harrowgate tonight
I passed a bunch of kids
hanging on the steps
to the chocolate factory.
A girl's leg was dangling
from the concrete steps
and as I neared the place
the kids all squirmed about
and tucked it underneath
their own and sat unusually
still and quiet for this
uncooled weekend night.

A car pulled up, a woman
asked about her daughter.
-- How should we know, they say
collectively, and fidget
like some nervous bride
out of Lo Sposo Deluso,
new to the act of deception.
-- What's that? the woman sparks
catching a gleaming toenail
the audience knows is there.
But she, unschooled in farce,
does not leave her car
to lift the tablecloth
or fling the arras back.
-- Oh, that's not your daughter,
they say, sure she's fooled,
-- it's just her best friend Donna
sleeping off a drunk.
The woman drives away.

They know what all kids know,
that cunning masters force,
they've learned the rules of farce
from the cynic hanging on the corner
who laughs himself to death,
and when the street is clear
they reconstruct their plan
to drag her by the legs
behind the pizza parlor.
Only when her head
flops from step to step
and bruises paint her thigh
I order them to stop.

For she is just the age
of a medieval bride,
her sodden hair a spill
of knotted wilting jonquils
splayed across the sidewalk.
Her stomach is atwitch
though the rest of her
lies all motionless
and won't be roused by touching
sweet-talk and promises
her girlfriends sing and coo
into her jeweled ear.

The ruse is incomplete
but still the kids relax,
they think the girl will live
although they scatter up
and down the unlit street
into yard and alley
peeking out from bin
and dumpster, silent, shy
when the ambulance pulls up.

Left alone the medic bends
above the body, his fingers
playing up and down
the fretboard of her spine --
like Rigoletto presented
with the floppy sack
into which he thinks
his enemy is stuffed --
the neighbors all seem pleased,
exchanging nod and smile,
until the mother rounds
the block, escapes her car
left gunning in the street,
and dropping to her knees
just like the hunchback jester
out for his fool's revenge,
recalls some small prophecy
about this flesh and blood
halfheard and overlooked.
Let us be early Medieval of late Renaissance,
spike-featured Norman Christ
or bone-faced Dureresque peasant,
skeleton staining the flesh.

let us descend the granite steps
and gather at the river's edge
for today is an Eakin's day on the Schuylkill:
boat races, festive crowds, spontaneous celebration.
See the strong young men lift their sculls
from the racks and carry them overhead
like slender polished beetles
to the murky and opaque waterway.
See the girls sleek and oiled cheer them on,
the losers as well as the winners.
See the geese that summer and winter here
spring up over the island. See them sport
with one another in raucous feathery
gaggles and announce to the daily horde
the absence of human frailty.

For all seems well under the cutting sun:
Joan of Arc is heroically bronzed
though even she cannot halt traffic along the drive,
and Mad Anthony Wayne rears on his horse
with the famed golden testicles.
How miraculous we seem to ourselves on this fair mountain
as cyclists weave round us, in and out
of joggers and strawberry mansions.

There is more: deep in the earth
an orchestra plays something lush,
romantic, called back and tempered
by the limping Hungarian.
There on the bank I see
an old Black man --
fishing for catfish -- stepped from a genre painting.

But remember we have come to watch the boat races --
the crews in their sculls on the Schuylkill
2-man, 4-man, 8-man and coxswain,
barking his rubbery lips, stretched
over a frighteningly oracular beak:
Stroke! Stroke! Stroke!
and the coach puttering around
effortlessly in his motor boat,
looping lazy figure-eights about them
as they rain sweat, snap ligaments, and groan.
But this is only practice,
the race is soon to run.
Only then will these young oarsmen show
an old and tired Charon the ropes --
how to run his ferry faster
on this one of many rivers,
stroke by stroke by stroke.
I've waited so long for this, said Zosia,
at midnight I checked my drearnbook, my sennik,
and what it said of rushing waters was true --
more suffering and tragedy. The river
beneath the street rose up, it flooded
the intersection up to the stopsign,
it carried me all ten blocks to church.
So many people were waiting outside.

Czerw the kielbasa maker, the red coat lady,
the German forelady from the mill, my daughter
in her first communion dress all lace
and beads and sequins, seven yards of material
at least, even the Archbishop wearing his miter.
But they wouldn't let me enter the church,
like the time Ukrainian policemen
and their German bosses blocked the doorway

to my cousin's hut. This is also explained
by the sennik -- no answer will be found.
My insides ached all night, that's nothing new,
my daughter dead, one of my sons in jail,
my father living in a shed, he writes
another harvest will fail, my husband, what
can be said of him, he'd have me starve
or freeze to death and still he steals my food.

When I was married the whole village came
for one whole week. Grass still does not cover
the patch of ground out back where couples danced.
It was the first wedding after the war.
The night before my vows I dreamt of water.
My mother only laughed and tied the wedding cap
more tightly. My brother clubbed the pig to death
and slit its gut, scalded it with water.

I don't believe in dreams. When I planted
some myrtle by the grave of my daughter
to remind her of her difficult task ahead
in Purgatory, the monk scolded me.
I think he took the steamed barley I left,
or last week's rain washed it away.
In my dream she cried from hunger or thirst.
I don't need my sennik to tell me that.
I think of wandering through Poland,
walking into the fields,
sidestepping elaborate swirls of cowshit,
eating tiny strawberries
I bought from an old peasant woman.
She overcharged me -- knowing there are things
for which I would pay any price.

I wanted to buy beads for Teresa.
An old man had dozens
dangling from the top of his stall.
I thought of Reymont's novel,
when, in the Jew's marketplace,
old and proud Boryna meets
young and beautiful Jagna,
and buys her love for a string of beads,
a few acres of land.

Later they marry and she betrays him,
making bloody love to his son
behind the desperate and beautiful haystacks.
Teresa would not understand --
fathomable smile, shallowness breeding pain.

That was in Przemysl,
where I walked along the San River
through endlessly plowed fields.
I watched a man in white robes
holding a net on the end of a long pole
by a sewer that let blood from the slaughterhouse
to the river -- fishing out chunks of lard.

Afterwards I sat by the cows
and thought about war and love.
You can't have one without the other, I realized,
picturing the old woman with whom I was staying.
That night she enacted the fearful pantomime
of her. brother's death, handcuffed and shot
against a brick wall in the town square.
Hitler's armies on one side
of the river, Stalin's on the other.

I think of wandering through Poland.
A pigtailed girl leads the cows home.
An old man from a neighboring village
fiddles in the marketplace.
Men pass the day
rooted in front of the roadhouse,
drinking warm beer, gazing
at the cheekworn mountains.

Later I lie on the dusty riverbank
watching smoke from the peasant bonfires
echo through the hills, blanketing the evening,
knowing I could kill for love.
The fanfare from St. Mary's towering crown,
cut short for the thirty-thousandth time this year.
Long since the Tartars, shot the trumpeter down.
At five p.m. the riot police appear.
Inside the church homeless women shiver,
and workers' mangled knees whap the marble floor.
Sermons that the priest may not deliver
keep them lining up, coming back for more.
When I am stopped the policemen are polite,
visors raised, billy clubs encased. In pairs
they stand or stroll, one fiddles with his flashlight.
They might be shopgirls admitting their own affairs,
arm in arm, voices shrill, full of their own
importance. Turpitude on loan.
Be suspicious, I'm forewarned by the young poet,
of any writer who's managed to live here so long.
Since the fifties thaw, he means, on the first floor
no less, while he awaits eviction
from a fifth-floor walkup under a leaky roof.

Don't be fooled by his work with the Partisans,
his Home Army commission during an earlier occupation,
when he was barely as old as the young poet
is now. He can't be counted on, which is,
I'm instructed, different from being trusted.

But the old poet, son of a village organist,
looks like a hawk stripped of its urge
to prey. Gracious as an old bowtied hotel waiter.

Every word, gesture, thing, in this part of Europe,
chides the young poet, is political,
pointing out the precious gap, cloying and boisterous,
between my words, almost and free,
dangerous, unbridgeable, into which
one's friends might one day disappear.

What right have I to rummage through the past?
writes the young poet. He believes, he tells me,
only the language of bargehands, words to deliver
the tangible smuttiness of coal, flirt
with the young panienki selling trinkets below
Wawel Castle -- language that won't give
itself to any other abusive master.

And the old poet who emerged almost intact
from the failure of civilization with his friends
to become hopeful children in a new order.
Teach us how to live, they pleaded, step by step,
from the very beginning, how to eat,
how to build, how to love, how to write.

His poems, however, always whisk him back
to the harvest: Mother with an apron
full of feathers, where cows thrash about
in the sagging barn, and men shout
across fields grey with flax and rye.
Where everyone's invited to the wedding,
and only mouldering haystacks at night
watch and comment upon your nightmare cry.

I am helpless here. Lightheaded, inflamed.
After the requisite vodka, toasts,
and handkissing, we manage a slow descent.
Halfway down the well goes black.
Fearful of our steps, forgetting how to count,
my wife runs her fingertips along the walls,
searching like a censor for irregularities
in the crackling plaster. instead of a light switch
a doorbell is pressed. Some beleaguered poet
or his widow, charlady or porter,
is roused halfway to dawn. Like prankish children
we flee. A flutter of suspicion, accusation
rises up to the mouldy vault, its short sleep
abandoned -- for a more familiar perch.
Bluster of cold. The city's fortress walls
show ice in bleeding cracks and I'm alone,
though streets and cellar shops have teemed all day
with wildly gesticulating vendors. And everyone, it seems,
has something dear to sell -- radishes
and brooms, amber strands and ration clips.
Ideas. Complaints. Vestiges of fate.

And it is quiet here -- battering ram walls,
blanketed doors and racks of smoke
bulging to the ceiling's stuccoed vaults.
Two men I always see debate pre-war
disputes. A father late from work
works to charm his moping woolen daughter,
who tugs her braid and dabs it in some cake.

So I am free in here, where no one looks askance.
Everyone, it seems, wants to have
the same. Until they come -- the city's
deaf and mute contingent, silent mass
herding itself inside. Only a Gypsy
band, packed across the threshold of a restaurant,
can cause a greater stir, though the city's
Gypsies, dark with the grimy swagger of restraint,
know how to stir the soul. And these others,
who wear the leather boots, painted curls,
sheepskin vests, and oriental scarves,
fashions that identify the modern
youthful Pole, they are more than different.

They raise in me flutters of unease.
Their mimes are too extravagant -- simple
points entail the beating of a breast.
Grunts and snorts sound too much like the words
approximate. I know at once
who loves whom and who despairs of it,
who has funds and who must turn to beg.

Everything is clear, complex and full
of hurt that is adult, impossible
to soothe, although the gestures and the groans
bespeak an infant's needs. How little that I say
is necessary. How much less I try.

A woman enters, tall and grand, young
enough to know her looks will get her what
she wants. She will, I'm sure, walk out
at once, into another world, where beauty
strives to stay unmaimed. She will, at least,
have her cup across the street, away
from these, wholly content in their otherness.

Who barely know or care I'm here, inches
away, coffee gone, frantic markings
that scar the page. I stop to gaze at her --
beauty that stands her utterly apart --
while she, true to form, stares up and past,
ignoring my glance, and seats herself nearby.

A feeble cry, a bold decisive forearm
swat, she grapples with the smoky air,
hails her tribe, affirms their wordless rampart.

                I've heard this is how all stories end:
                a guy drives home through the snow
                while the woman dances in a bar. His car
                has one headlight
			  and a heater with a tickle
			  in its throat. This doesn't have to be
                a story about loss or love. We've all heard
                about the boy who saves a snowball
                in a freezer until school's out and summer
                cracks its knuckles one finger at a time;
                how he removes it with wool gloves and an opportunity
                for revenge. He misses his target:
                the classmate who teased his lisp,
                and his planning becomes cobwebs of snow
                in the wake of a passing truck.
                Love exists of its own reticence and
                memory too. I once loved a woman in winter,
                the first snowfall of inches we wrestled
                in the powder, cold moisture skiing beneath our clothes
                until the streetlights exhaled their breathy light
                and neighbors stretched their necks past window curtains
                to witness her snowball kiss my face. Sometimes
                I can still feel the burning welt of ice
                rubbing my cheek. At the end of Modern Times
                the Tramp and the Gamin walk along a road
                until they become silhouette--faceless, nameless,
                you, me. This must be a function of remembering.
                The first grade girl a six year old longed to hit
                with a snowball in July grew into a teen he desired
                and she sprouted up again like a storm front as he knelt
                by his mother's grave in late November
                forty years later. A galaxy of flurries
                falling from the garden of sky. The bar bands
                might jam all night, and the woman will keep
                dancing dancing		dancing while I try to decide
                between a U-turn and the drive home.
                Again, an evening of snow, the roads slick
                as a seducer, slick as the hair of my early teens.
                Tonight I read Gerald Stem while my speakers pulsate with the bass
                of Steel Pulse, and all I want is a plane ticket or a car that can make it
                all the years back to my adolescence. Maybe
                I'll hitchhike: drop me off in Greenwich Village
                or by Madison Square Garden, I'll walk the rest--
                I've done it before: December nights,
                snow melting into rain at the roofs, the buildings
                becoming walls of a wind tunnel for the wailing bay winds
                by the Battery. I've seen skyscrapers sway during storms
                reminding me the world spins. I saw a grown man
                cry and kick at the thick air while cursing the breeze
                that kited his cardboard protection among the pigeons.
                I remember--it was 1984 and I wanted to put my hands
                on his shoulders, say sentences full of consolation
                and understanding, and maybe give him some dollars
                or my hat. I wanted to... now it seems so futile;
                now I can pity my inability to help him;
                now I can think only of the pigeons of that city
                so different from the pigeons of Kalamazoo
                or Chicago or Detroit. On the streets of New York
                in the tiny parks and squares where old Jewish men
                and old Italian men play chess, on the rooftops of offices and brownstones,
                amputee pigeons squander their months, hobbling
                one footed and broken winged; the beheaded bird at the ferry terminal....
                Back then the way its body still rocked and pitched
                on its claws fascinated me, and I stood transfixed,
                curious because energy can't be created
                or destroyed so where did the charges locked between the synapses
                of that bird'snerves escape to? No one knows.
                That was April, 1984;
                that was the year my mother wrote her children's book,
 Petey the Pigeon--who had one foot and lived
                in the ferry terminal, the year the body of a jumper
                landed inches from my big toe. That was the year
                I loved Sherrie from Negril and learned
                her brother wanted to break my neck because I was white
                or punk rock or for no reason. That year Steel Pulse
                vibrated the Beacon Theatre, Peter Tosh skanked on stage
                at Radio City and I wrote poems for girls in school,
                took them to concerts and tried to seduce them later and failed
                or succeeded, I can't recall. That was the year my last umbrella
                whipped inside out so I flipped it in a garbage can
                and chose to ignore the Jamaican and Korean sidewalk salesmen,
                chose to ignore them for good,
                chose for the wings of precipitation to strike me
                as they fell, failing to defy the gravity of the world.
                On the bus stop where I once stood
                daily, I notice the exercise place
                has closed; no longer
                can I watch women in tights
                shimmering jello-like in its windows
                one flight up. I don't mind. Heading
                uptown to meet a bus that'll never come,
                I walk back the calendar to days I could watch a woman
                each morning, workbound
                and was unable to say anything
                about wanting: my words were buried
                in the sand of my throat as my pick-up lines crashed
                against beach-wall teeth.  I can see these strangers more clearly
                than girls I dated. And isn't doting
                over women I desired and never took out
                somehow American in the same way
                the boy who tugs his mom by the hand,
                finger-pointing through a department store
                after Christmas is American. And my father's father
                coming to this country from Italy
                discovered the streets weren't paved with gold, weren't
                paved at all, and, as an immigrant,
                he was expected to lay asphalt over cobblestones.
                His disappointment and his willingness
                to work were also American. His dreams
                were bags full of Coney Island and the Brooklyn Bridge.
                Here, in that city where I no longer live,
                I've learned the stores I shopped, the clubs,
                the old acquaintances, the women
                I loved or didn't love and wished I had
                are gone, and the gap their absence creates
                can't be stuffed with letters, photos,
                phone calls. I march streets of strange landmarks;
                my memories make turns: years pass as storefronts
                and when I choose to forget the bus,
                wedge my way through vacationers and business throngs,
                I see two women in a boutique's window
                changing a mannequin's clothes: cotton pastels
                despite the January date.
                That five year old, having unwrapped
                the new year begins writing a list of birthday wants
                four months away. It's made of race cars
                and electric trains like the set my grandfather gave me
                which never worked
                which rusted in the corner as I played
                with dolls, holding each fate that may have been.
                Forgive me, I was only learning
                the lives I might live.
So I took her to the river.
                We strolled west along Christopher Street
                beyond the brownstones and sex shops and piano bars
                where drag queens sang torches that weren't for she or me.
                Beyond even the West Side Highway we walked
                onto a concrete pier that stretched like her boyfriend's accusatory finger
                over the Hudson, and the lights of New Jersey
                burned low one at a time, so that the other couples who held hands
                like drowning men, recognizing their despair
                without comprehending it, they seemed larger, darker.
                We clutched each other closer
                and tried guessing which window in one of those buildings
                would go out last. When neither of us were right
                we laughed, and that laughter pulled us tight
                and the sound of our clothes rubbing seemed loud as a car wreck
                but there were no cars
                nor a moon
                incessant, incensed by a scow moving its cargo of refuse;
                only our tongues and a desire we couldn't refuse.
                only wavelike ripples rapping the pier,
                It was the feast of Saint James
                and I could hear the ancient bell of a neighborhood church,
                cranky as a crone; she led me from the water
                past the brownstones and the piano bars and the all-night cafes
                where oldermen seduced young women or young men
                depending on their fancy; she led me, both of us young
                and full of chance, up the stairs of a walk-up to the roof
                where I took off my boots. She took of her dress.
                I removed my belt and watched the glow of a street lamp
                rise above the edge of the roof. In that light her hair became a thunderstorm
                and we felt like rain. I could hear the church bells barking like market sellers,
                and I knew of her boyfriend whom she'd call tomorrow.
                I knew too that I didn't love her
                despite the lightning, despite even this poem.
                From that roof I could have seen that pier and its fistful of lovers
                and the Hudson with its barges and garbage scows.
                In New Jersey one lit window in a building dim with contentment.
                Like platelets the road crews ride the avenues;
                truck backs open, they sporadically stop
                to scab a pothole with hot asphalt and back up
                traffic for five minutes--
                				    one guy sliding from the cab,
                cigarette between pinky and ring finger,
                a shovel pivoting in the other hand.
                Scoop   Drop   Pat   Scoop   Drop   Pat Pat Pat
                Such a simple process.

                Two or three decades back and still in some films
                convicts did this work, but since Checkered Cabs closed
                and with the paper mills slowly donating
                less and less saw dust to the sky, it's become a wage,
                a way to buy another pack of Marlboro Reds
                and another Bic the last one lost a couple miles back.

                                       ~

                Why do thirty degrees in April seem warmer
                than the same thirty degrees in February?

                Every love I've lost I lost in spring
                or in some bar or classroom.

                Scars on my back from passion scratches,
                scars on my arm from knife wishes, the white line
                along the back of my hand where I slalomed
                a razor between hairs
                and spent the next seven minutes watching blood clot--

                                       ~

                I can't imagine anymore the soldier's life
                I once wanted, can't imagine the boredom of waiting
                for action, the cold nights of bunkers
                wanting only to smell the flowers of home: pansies
                and creeping phlox which might, just now, be blossoming.

                                       ~

                Early April and I'm still impatient;
                waiting for a day not impregnated with mow, a day
                when I'm able to take Alex to Milham Park
                for more than half an hour.
                                             Only last February I watched a man
                standing at the rim of ice before the warming mud
                of the playground. His daughter swung oblivious
                to anything but the sun which held her hand
                like she wished he would.
                And oblivious to even this wish.
                                                  That year winter left early,
                an insulted dinner guest no one missed,
                and that man stood there, grateful
                he wouldn't be called to salt the roads that night
                while the cigarette burned like the desire to be nothing
                like his father.

                What I think about now:
                                         slam dancing those nights
                when 300 of us massed in the pit our bodies red
                and ripe with adrenalin and three chord guitars by bands of initials:
                X, DOA, TSOL.
                               The old Rock Hotel on Jane Street
                right by the Hudson and the drag bars. I once rented a room
                four flights above the stage
                and spent the night staring at the shadowy barges on the river
                while cockroaches played fag in the bathroom
                and a young woman lay passed-out on the thin mattress.

                When she woke the next morning she asked if we--
                before she finished but
                said nothing because I had wanted to.
                That night was the last night of shows at the Rock Hotel
                although we didn't know it then. Some neighborhood group
                closed it down with complaints
                about the proliferation of graffiti on nights bands played:
                I shook my head
                spray paint cancer of New York Hardcore and
 Black Flag and illegibility--a pseudonym,
                a chance at immortality.

                The lattice work of cracks on a windshield
                --a shard of gravel jumped from a road crew truck
                then bounced
                             and bounced again onto the car hood
                before mating with the glass, an embryo for the shoots
                like the body of a crushed roach, its eight legs sprawled
                or a band's atlas-the towns of its tours
                moored to its home city by lines of black ink.

                Out of town the silos have all shrunk:
                                                       grain levels lower this April
                than history. On the road shoulders

                possum corpses, raccoon pelts, sometimes a house pet or strayand always
                the puddle of dry blood.
                Some days road crews come and pull these
                from the highways, other days a group of boys
                too old to play war
                                    too young for bars
                take them, shoving all that matted fur into a brown paper bag.

                And later, for fun they'll throw the body back and forth
                in their school's parking lot
                or in the long cool field of a city park.

                Thaw:
                the time of year for construction
                and destruction. In Kalamazoo three buildings
                are going down.
                                 The crews don't use dynamite
                or a wrecking ball like the crowd anticipates, but

                the way steam shovels and bulldozers attack
                makes it more melodramatic--
                                            with every hit rises a geyser of dust.
                Did the Rock Hotel go down this way?

                My last visit driving the West Side I saw
                only a vacant lot in its place. I had to pull over
                and walk Jane Street again. It was only then I noticed
                the spray paint fading with age on neighboring walls;
                a galaxy of phlox and mums straining in the filled-in foundation.
                Despite seeing them all my life, I couldn't recognize my fingerprints
                if you carried their whorls and swirls to me
                having found them on a glass or on a woman's body.
                I'd have to believe their cursive signature,
                finger the ridges I've touched all these years and try to decipher
                their script

                             like the psychic I visited
                who grasped my wrist and fingered the lines of my palm
                annotating a stranger's biography. He had me ringered for a painter,
                said I suffered some blow to the ego, believed I should work
                with my hands seeing an absence
                of calluses and blisters. Remember the lemon juice writing
                I learned in fifth grade magic books
                or the black light ink some clubs use
                or the braille typewriter in the library where I worked--
                how I could never read its pellets scattershot in lines on the page.
                I can't reclaim what else he said
                so contained was I by thoughts
                about the signs we carry in our pockets or might see in the sky.
                Was he right?

                Three years later it seems insignificant
                or indistinguishable as braille pages held at arm's length.
                Perhaps Garcia Lorca could tell me if the gypsies really know,
                but Garcia Lorca's dead,
                and no one foresaw the revolution, his murder,
                and the wind above his grave is dry and quiet
                as the wind running the streets of Kalamazoo
                or the streets of Staten Island.
                                                  The wind always wordless.
                The wind.

                          I've heard a woman once heard voices in the wind
                and tried locking it outside, stuffing old underwear
                into the cracks of the doors and around windows.
                For nights her fifties stereo rattled the house with song.
                Then silence. Neighbors began to miss her

                standing among the weedy lawn; all the curtains now shut,
                they couldn't see the platoon of cats
                she barracked.  Finally some teenage boys found courage....
                The smell in the foyer: cat dung and something staler,
                more pungent. They'd never smelled decay before.

                That was on Ross Street by the store where I bought comics;
                the cops came, the paramedics;
                the photographers from the papers flashed her walls of red paint words
                and paperboys delivered them to the neighborhood
                with daily installments of her diary entrees: cats and nonsense words.

                Whether these stories were true I'll never know---
                so many unanswerable questions. I know friends
                who can go to sleep with a stray inquiry roaming the alleys of consciousness
                and wake to it tamed by an answer. I knew the definitions
                to the scrawled glyphs on handball courts and subway walls
                Now the language has changed. I believe some people
                can read cards, I believe some people know the dialects
                of the dead, the statements backwards masked on old L.P.s,
                the tongue of the breeze which even now howls

                through my driveway, its volume loud
                trying to make itself understood.
                I believe in the curse of 1940.
                I believe in the stone stumbled over that starts a streak of bad luck,
                how we try to trace our days back to it, following
                our misfortunes the way we might follow a spiral of crows
                down to the corpse of a small doe at roadside. And my brother

                can't watch a Ranger game anymore
                without wearing a fifteen year oldjersey, its tattered stairwell of letters
                up the front now dull, the once royal blue more peasant-colored,
                washed out

                like the face of a young woman who's been crying off and on
                for the last forty-eight hours. Her boyfriend stole her checkbook
                and credit cards while leaving his identity behind.
                She's so embarrassed
                that She's called no one but her mother and the police

                answering their inquiries with yes or no and sometimes
                only shaking her head. When the phone rings
                she crosses herself and the seconds before she lifts the handset
                from its cradle become an interval of hope.

                Then time goes awry,
                and the moment between the first trill of the phone
                and the next is room enough
                for their seven month relationship:
                their initial meeting in a laundromat one block
                from where she now stands, then how she sawhim again
                at the newsstand in the building where she works. He asked her name,
                offered to pay for the paper, and finally
                mentioned dinner. He was a restaurant critic


                so their meals were free
                although now she can't recall ever seeing his name
                in print. She suddenly realized he never paid for anything.
                Anything.


                Tomorrow she'll call the papers in town....

                What we discuss when we discuss luck--

                how my family divvied dollars among the lotteries but me; I looked, instead,
 to get lucky, smoked Lucky Strikes and stubbed my cigarettes silent
                then relit them to please the divine: a sacrifice
                a ritual of singles bars and punk bands. Why? I can't say,
                but my mother keeps playing birthdays and anniversaries
                for the lotto, Michael still hand-washes that shirt after each loss,
                as if detergent could remove such a stain.

 You don't understand, I saw thirteen games in 79 wearing thisjersey, and they didn lose
                one. They tied two. They made it to the finals.  I know it crazy to believe,
                but you don't understand.

                But I do.

                as does that woman who, up late, has stopped sobbing and regained
                her wonderment with the world. On the news
                the sportscaster flirts with her
                as he scrolls through the scores,a roll call of leagues
                and seasons, all this time freeing memories because he didn't like sports.
                She becomes a tomboy again. She's able then

                to appreciate her mother's support, and can hear her mom
                cluttering the kitchen with sound. Distraction and distance must
                be close: all this action helps her forget.

                Then the phone rings again.

                The miles home become months of my life,
                become nothing. Along the highway, raptors traipse skyward as I approach,
                singing their chorale of caws and complaints.

                Sometimes I make each traffic light
                right before it blinks red or as it just shines green, so I never have to brake.
                Such days I know my fortune's good--

                I could talk my way out of a traffic ticket,
                find a ten spot in a pocket or in the parking lot--

                but tonight the signals all wink their yellow eyes,
                letting me know my home will roar hollow with a televised crowd eight hundred miles away
                and I have no jersey to wear, no protection whatsoever.
                I draw hard on my cigarette and ash it out.

                Light it again.

                In her apartment of noises that woman crosses herself as the telephone sounds.

                We do these things for luck.
                My son loves me.
                An address book full of friends
                and lovers who some nights call my name.

                A few Fridays each year I suffer
                through bad hands of seven card stud, the freak
                four kings that demolish my full house,
                and I shake my head later in the rear-view mirror.
                Would I be happier if I won?

                No. I long for the unmitigated grace
                of the squirrell balancing on the phone wire
                or on the thinnest branch of the backyard sycamore.
                Now I want the ease of that branch’s sinewy movements
                in the easterly breeze of evening.

                No; I want nothing less
                than to be that wind, empty and entirely of the world.
                What it had to be like: Shackleton and two of his crew
                facing the glaciers, the crust cracking
                beneath each step, the gale's mouth spitting
                a spackle of sleet and hail. Fifty feet of rope

                tethers them together. They've driven screws
                through the soles of their boots, makeshift cleats
                No maps. No paths. Only duty, a fine drape of snow
                and South Georgia's alpine geography.

                Hungry and hallucinatory, they know they're the only hope
                for twenty-two crewmates marooned and counting
                penguins on another stony island: they must continue,
                Shackleton leading until he steps into the limbo of air

                beneath a sidewalk of ice. If the world is similar
                to cartoons, he may have hung there a minute
                in mid-air, spinning in the grip of cold wind
                like a nine ball spinning in the space above the pocket

                before dropping.  The other two follow, dragged
                through twenty feet of air and prayers to mountain side
                on which they slide--a 900 foot toboggan ride,
                their ragged coats and pants their only sleds.

                As usual I've begun in the story's middle
                despite the new year and talk of new beginnings.

                Here, the heater stutters its one forgettable line
                and neither of us wants to walk to the car, storebound.
                The wind mutters like a young schizophrenic who would just as soon threaten
                as bless you with the mercy of his savior,
                but truly all he says is this is the coldest winter in history.

                On the west coast the fault line shimmies, and on the bible network
                another mouth of apocalypse
                reads the weather report of ages.

                The inexact sciences: physics, emotology, meteorology.
                How the innocent attempt of a penguin to fly
                influences rhe inflections of the wind a hemisphere away and the wave-size
                at the ocean's far shore. What I know

                This frost can slur the world's axial fluency,
                the traffic slows, honking the slush, and in frozen rivers
                ships mimic The Endurance
                barnacled by ice among the floes.

                1914. Antarctica
                Its crew works for warmth, daily shoveling ice
                from the hull; still, it creeps back each evening
                like a nightmare Shackleton brushes away
                harking orders or reciting Shelley, Byron, Keats

                ~

                and same days Dante to his men, the darkness now
                twenty hours long, so cold they almost expect shadows

                cast in the dim glimmers of the galley to freeze and the smoke
                climbing the ladder to heaven from the stove to get stuck

                somewhere above the rigging and the masts.
                Winter cast? its phenomena of cold; Shackleton records the past

                months in his journal. Soon they must abandon ship,
                the crew salvaging supplies, making camp on an ice slip

                surrounded by wreckage, dead seals, the Antarctic Circle.
                Worsley and Shackleton surveying this ghetto could well be Dante and Virgil

                at Circle Three. Months later, orders to trudge the slushing
                floes, their flotsam melting into the camp's ice, the men mushing

                the dogs that must someday become dinner, the sledges useless
                for pulling their salvaged boats--vessels of a fragile promise:

                rescue or at least dry land. They're heading: barren Elephant Island
                One hundred miles due north. Thirst their biggest threat and water all around.

                Perhaps what they missed the most:
                the swell of a woman's breast in winter,
                her skin almost colorless hut for the shade of her bodice.
                It's at this moment need and desire blur,

                an hallucination of want made real by the two of us.
                How easy it is in the solitary confinement
                of ego to lust, how easy to forget
                pain and tenderness and the temptation

                of the blood.  But outside the pulse of the wind
                rushes, adrenalized and loaded with lymphocytes of snow.
                If we were other people or younger we might
                drop in the drifts, side-by-side

                and leave in our wake the hollow shell of angels.
                Instead we do nothing. The civilized world glows
                saffron on either side of the street, and one of those lights
                sneaks inside to throw our mortal silhouettes on the wall.
                Last year a youngman forgot to look both ways
                when shortcutting down the ravine and across the tracks
                and he was smacked by a train
                although I don't believe an Amtrack could actually sneak up
                on anybody. I wonder what he thought the tremor
                of the rails was; the steady clack of those four cars

                might have become the whirr of a june bug
                strafing the roof of a childhood porch
                and amplified by years and a phobia. The one he recalled
                flew big as an ear
                and he stood there for only a second
                loking at the bug light which soon became the sole eye
                of a diesel engine, and he survived.

                And nine years ago I might have stood one footed at the sight
                of a rat on a subway platform, could hear more of them chattering
                late nights after CBGBor the Mudd Club
                waiting for the six train below Bleecker Street.
                And when it arrived, Mark and I would scan the cars
                for our graffiti; perhaps he'd produce four colors
                from his knapsack, and we'd paint our tags through the tunnels,
                one of us checking for transit cops.

                That time he tried to cheat a fare at Twenty-third Street
                we were both chased
                until there was nowhere else to go but down
                so we did. The dark air around us
                hummed electric, and the occasional express
                fumed sparks as it passed, lighting our way
                for a moment. Then I tripped

                and in a second of instinct I tried to grip
                the third rail to break my fall.
                I failed, spraining my ankle on a cross tie.
                With me crippled the rest of the way, we'd never make it
                to the next station seven blocks South
                before the next local accosted us.

                All the emergency exit Signs died of loneliness.

                That day we discovered the Eighteenth Street station,
                long abandoned to the homeless and the few teens
                who thought it was a great place to bring a girl
                or a dime bag. While the next train chanted by,
                I sat with Mark, both of us panting, our hearts
                restless birds beneath our rib cages.
                If this is the only foolish thing I've done, I'm blessed,

                but even Christine who tunes her mandolin in the next room
                knows it's not, tallies my mistakes and misdemeanors
                in a notebook and reminds me of them when we fight.
                I try to understand this as I understand why Mark
                didn't part with a buck of lunch that November afternoon
                why that kid paused

                atop those rattling tracks,and why we have totake
                the shortcuts sometimes, despite the danger,
                despite the voice within us saying, There a safe route, please take it:

                we got to test the angels that save us.
                I can't see them behind me though,
                see only the sparks of iron wheels against rails
                burning the dark air briefly.
                His cobwebbed face exhales and cumulus
                puffs of carbon dioxide explode in silence
                within the arms of arctic winds. He stands

                still, head raised, gazing for the Northern Lights
                tattooed on the February sky. A few years back
                he might have counted the constellations, recognizing them

                on his fingers, Orion, Draco, Ursa Minor....
                Last night the swollen moon burned sullen,
                painted shadows on the street dark and long as if

                it were morning, and he stared at the black form
                unfurling from his toes onto the fading asphalt.
                It's name sat at the edge of his tongue

                like the name of another who's long gone
                and whom he imagines he saw one day among the faces of pedestrians
                in a crosswalk far from this suburb of cyclone fences

                and pedigreed dogs. Tonight, those names
                are pointless; the hypnotist wind beckons him,
 Forget.... There's a treasure buried above the clouds--

                he can still envision the almanac pages for today
                even if he's surrendered the titles of the stars
                their fanciful rage, even if his shadow has left him

                there's still this curb, his house behind him
                with its windows lit by end-table lamps, the photo albums
                beneath them suffering their comas of disinterest. Rings of breath

                stagger from his mouth and dance the stage
                of atmosphere below the streetlamps.  He can almost see
                a name spelled as he exhales,

                he can almost hear it whispered into his ear,
                the cool tongue of wind licking his lobe.
                The breaths rise into the dark sky
                                                   then dissolve.              
                That year, the city finally silenced
                my adolescence by downing the power to stages
                all over New York. The clubs darkened, and bands
                parked their vans in front of rehearsal spaces and allowed them
                to rust away or be stripped by vandals. That year

                I squandered hours befriending whiskey sours and imported cigarettes
                at the Cherry Tavern with its jukebox of Jamaican reggae and ska,
                and its dollar-a-rack bar table--a thin green sheet of felt
                stretched transparent atop potholed slate.
                My faith in fate can be traced to that table
                and the eightball I bet my wages on there; the dates I met there
                after signing out.
                                   How I slipped the silver moon of a quarter
                into the juke and called forth 165-the sole record
                with a scratch, entrapping the bar crowd
                in the same three chords until someone kicked the machine, frustrated.

                Was it me?
                           I think it was
                                          the night Laura stoodme up. I think
                it was the night my angles weren't right,
                and twice the eight ball balked at my orders,
                my cue rebelled and stole the fold of bills from my wallet,
                dispersed it among my opponents and the waitress, a veritable car bomb
                of generosity. There's a ferocity in fortune turning its back to you
                a rage so great you have little

                but the echo of your own footfalls in the hollow
                canyon of a Lower East Side street, in the cantankerous fluorescence
                of your building's corridors. Oh spirit-who-flips-the-coin of chance
                and skill, of love and disappointment,

                I lit the novena of my cigarettes for you, sitting on a fire escape
                following the movement of gulls above the East River
                as they fell toward the grey canopy of water, cawing with vigor
                and summer lust, the heat rising from Manhattan
                                                           splaying their gray feathers
                and holding them aloft.

                                       No signs. No phone calls bold with apologies
                or explanations. Nothing but a crumple of bills
                left on an end table,
                and the crooked legs of stubbed out butts
                in an ashtray. Not even a band to play
                one song to give me back that youth.
                At seven when I moved to a block full of Irish
                and Italians, their houses brilliant with middle classness,
                brilliant with basketball hoops and swimming pools,
                I wanted what mom couldn't give, and who doesn't want
                what's out of his grasp--Tommy Tierney, the Crupi brothers, Trisha McKeever
                I laughed at their Polish jokes and Black jokes
                and my Eastern European roots
                and the Jamaican friends of my old neighborhood,
                I just forgot.

                ~

                               I saw a UFO once. I remember it.
                I sat on a parked Volvo, avoiding our empty living room;
                late Saturday night, no babysitter;
                I was nine, and above the woods up the block
                a flat green strip of neon like a wayward bar sign
                hovered, and I stood on that car's hood to get a better look.
                Then I ran to get binoculars,
                but when I returned it rocketed heavenward while I remained,
                shaking because I believed I saw it, just like I believe
                an angel fluttered in my Chevy once

                when it rode a flying carpet of ice through an intersection.
                I just watched the woman's face in the approaching car
                as it changed from singing along to astonishment
                and then shock at impact. My body tried to escape
                the seat belt, and my head pivoted--something small and white
                flipped in the air. I know it was a styrofoam coffee cup
                somersaulting, acrobatic and hot,
                but at that moment, adrenalin erupting into my blood,

                it seemed alien, it seemed too graceful;
                it seemed personal, protective, judgmental.

                ~

                To count my sins should I begin with the skin's
                or the spirit's? with abundance or want?

                In the cemetery around the corner lay my mother's father,
                and in its courtyard we played baseball,
                the Crupi brothers always captains. One afternoon I stayed with their sister;
                she dared me to kiss her breasts.
                Sweat abandoned my nine year old body;
                as she brought my head to her tits I kissed them chastely,
                mouth unopen until my penis stirred its preadolescent smallness,
                and she squeezed....

                                     That night I moved among the mausoleums,
                restless and rustled with lust so even the sculptured Mary,
                granite white in the moonlight, was sexy.

                The cemetery I haven't mentioned
                buried only blacks, lay buried for the neighborhood kids:
                the secrecy of prejudice. Tommy always rattled the phlegm
                in his throat when we scuttled by a Black man on the streets,
                one of the others might've muttered, Nigger or Afroturf
                an old joke, so everyone would laugh
                and I wouldn't look at the passing man
                out of embarrassment.
                One morning we saw a hearse followed by its battalion of mourners,
                mostly Caddies or jalopies, motor into the Frederick Douglass Memorial,
                and we decided to spy, struggling through the wrought iron,
                down low behind headstones and statues until we were close
                to the pit, close enough to see the family,
                a handful of whites among them, close enough to see no one

                wept as the reverend spoke in a voice soft as siren lights.
                Then everyone sang, and it shocked us,
                this collective voice of love for life; I leaned closer still and noticed
                a girl my age, her skin the color of the overturned autumn earth,
                her eyes spotlighting the entire cemetery
                until someone behind me summoned up spit, someone else sniggered
                but before anything could be spoken or done, I hissed, No, she's beautiful
                or wished I had because nothing mattered

                but the girl, the marble angel looming above us,
                and that song ascending from our grief.
                I believe the world is small. Look
                the stone I just kicked down this street
                has gotten further in its journey;
                before this it was pulled down the road
                by the skid of a car
                and earlier brought by dump truck from a foundry.
                It jumped off here, in Constock, by either bump
                or its own gravel volition.

                There must be another guy my age
                kicking stones in his path even as I write this.
                This poem is for him
                and the person he loves who isn't
                with him. He might be anywhere

                on either coast. Overlooking the Pacific
                a young woman putters in her kitchen.  In New York
                my mother shifts her typewriter to capitals one more time.
                I want to hug them both but can't:
                no matter how small I believe the world to be
                I'm smaller, and even the extensions of telephones
                makes them impossible, at times, to hold.

                Last time I was in New York, Kermit and I laughed memory
                and college stories until I missed him
                and missed all the names we mentioned.

                This poem is for everyone I've loved.
                This poem is for no one.

                It's for the teenage boy who washes cars
                each day for a Dodge dealership in Akron, Ohio;
                he walks along a state road for half a mile
                to work and kicks the loose stones sometimes.

                Listen, gravel scatters on the surface of the small world.
                The ghost of my adolescence dyed
                his hair blue and grew it long and heavy.
                He hovered by the garbage cans, scavenging
                like my mother's insane brother
                who picks through dumpsters for stale bagels,
                who stole into my father's office years ago
                asking cash and later tried
                to set the building on fire with a mouthful of gasoline
                syphoned from a United Parcel truck.

                I saw the ghost of my adolescence pissing in an alley
                off Grove St.  I didn't think he saw me.
                He pissed, zipped up and disappeared into the darkness
                down the way, maybe looking for the Rastaman to score
                coke. Later, I heard him laughing
                with a brunette girl I'd never seen before;
                when they surfaced in the orange aura of New York nights
                --his arm around her shoulders, hers a python
                at his waist-they whispered to each other
                and kept laughing. It shocked me, such intimacy.

                I heard him again beyond the window separating a friend's place
                from the persistent conversation of Seventh Avenue.
                She and I'd been lovers once, five years before,
                but that night we lay on her mattress fully-dressed,
                and as she papered the walls with wants and mistakes,
                I stared at the book titles on her shelves
                until they became headlines or bold new constellations
                of letter-stars. I believe that ghost wanted me
                to want her again as it watched through the glass,
                squatting recklessly on the fire escape,

                but in the end she and I just lay there
                in the memory of our own respiration until she moaned in the voice
                of that ghost, possessed by what I used to be,
                what we used to be: this city, 1985.
                And if I believed we could converse then, this ghost of me
                and me, I might have asked how I could free it
                from this island, from sanding the floor of a boarded up brownstone
                each night as he trespassed and slept on East Fourth Street.  We said nothing.

                The blue and red tears of an ambulance entered the room,
                high-lighting the biographical spines of fascists
                in its glow; below, a radio danced its hip-hop,
                and when this passed we heard only the whispered sentences of traffic,
                her breathing, mine.

                Then the clatter of the ladder
                falling to cement, a tympani of garbage cans:
                the ghost of my adolescence sprinting,
                each square of the sidewalk another calendar day backward,
                the stars rattling in the wake of the spirit's exhaust.
                The way the stray fragments of asphalt ice
                grasp the filaments of street lights
                as if they were the only means of preventing thaw

                might well be the emberous tip of a birthday
                candle's wick after the wishing and the breathy push
                of hope. On my sixteenth birthday I pocketed

                my hands and desires and dined alone. I didn't feel young
                or old; I felt just the dull pulse of adolescence
                which beat its drum like a shaman in the distant

                prairie of my unconscious. Later, I followed
                taxis by foot and when I lost one to velocity or traffic,
                I chose another, and in this way I unwrapped the neighborhoods

                of Manhattan, one unfamiliar block at a time,
                rows of shops darkened with steel grates and early hours,
                stunted saplings bent under night's dark thumb.

                And the people--a beat cop, a woman walking
                her Golden Retriever, a couple holding their bodies closer
                than usual. It was a cool evening for August and the earth

                already lusted autumn's erotic touch.
                No, I didn't feel lonely or sad
                but I believe I might have said something about melancholy

                which means I lied or didn't understand,
                which means, really, that I hefted an adolescence
                similar to millions in this America, where the ice currently

                is abundant but melting, where a young girl
                struggles above the sixty-fourblack-or-white squares
                of a chessboard before deciding to move her rook,

                the piece she believes looks like an ashtray.
                She has no opponent. She sits
                with a strategy book, its spine broken

                so the cover remains forever open in mute surprise
                or indifference. Some people might call her attractive,
                even lovely. If there are spirits that watch over

                the young they must blink their eyes rapidly in the night sky
                and repeatedly. They've been spying us for millennia
                and witnessed this world when it still lay shrouded

                by clouds and dust. They don't tell us this. They don't whisper
                to that girl, push the pawn.  No, their voices are more quiet
                than a windless day on an abandoned blueberry farm where I dreamt

                I stood: the black sky a chalkboard for lessons
                I forfeited when I turned away to face the silent flatlands
                and the column of flailing red lights atop a distant radio tower

                on the dusty horizon, warning airplanes away
                and letting me know other people were out there,
                waiting at home, tuned in, and wanting for news.      
                As sea water freezes, the salt flees
                erecting itself a ladder toward some unseen landing,
                seven or seventeen feet above the impatient ice.
                Angels might climb to it. In the fading sunlight
                of a two hour day, you can see them through the scaffolding of snow,
                pirouetting and coiling on those saline sculptures,
                                                             Jacob's dream gone awry.

                ~

                The first sprig of spring-like weather
                and I'm tethered to IV tubing, a new scar
                extending across my abdomen like an unfinished turnpike
                through the hills and curves of flesh. Outside, the main drag

                unspools like a long grey scarf a child dropped
                and I watch it spill beneath a rag of cold in the distance. The traffic flashes
                its gold teeth in the sun of its business while I whittle
                hours into syllables until little by little time regains definition.

                ~

                And in the mirror at night
                I see a younger me, one who doesn't want
                to look me in the eye, a spiked prairie of hair
                all he'll show.

                                The reluctance of nostalgia or regret--
                I think of Jo who wore one of these green backless gowns
                just four months ago, how the nurses searched to find a vein

                sturdy enough to support a needle, the nourishment of tubes. By the end
                she must've been straw frail, pale as that nurse's skirt
                but stained with scabs and lesions.

                Jo who fired artillery with her eyes
                armed with desire, her pink hair like a struck flare
                in the strobes and floodlights of the Mudd Club,
                gorgeous but for the garden of violets that blossomed on the stems of her arteries,
                the needles she kept taped to a looseleaf binder.

                Had I known, nothing would differ.
                Had I returned and learned she was renting a bed
                at St. Vincent's, her only conversation the IV pump's hum
                and the old community volunteers with spun sugar hair, I would have visited,
                the whole time thankful with guilt that we hadn't fulfilled our adolescent lust.
                But no, just a phone call late,
                a remnant's voice muddy with long distance lines saying only pneumonia and services.
                What went unsaid was a wind from the Northwest Territories.


                Outside the snow falling like angel suicides.

                ~

                If it's true--no two snowflakes are alike
                and the helix of DNA forbids the duplication of fingerprints
                then no reflection in a mirror can truly be me.

                I saw a young girl lying in a backyard, her legs
                spreading, then closing, arms arcing
                                                     overhead before sledding back to her sides.
                She did this a dozen times, imprinting a platoon of angels--
                no two of them identical
                but close enough for her human eyes.

                An hour later how she's changed,
                unaware of the chapped skin of her cheeks and fingers
                as she stares from her window, those figures glowing in the porchlight's glare.
                And although she believes them perfect, she won't recall them

                twenty years hence, won't even notice
                the impression she leaves on the sheets of a lover's bed.

                ~

                53 Degrees.
                             76 Degrees more than a morning only a month ago.
                On a day like today I first saw Lake Michigan gyrating its hips,
                the force of melting ice a kind of intercourse
                between the seasons, and I saw water and frost to the earth's curve; that's all.
                The scent of sand, the breath of fresh water, the sweat
                of my own weakness rising.

                And Grand Haven's great concrete piers vibrated in the waves,
                like blaming fingers toward Illinois
                while the one light house erect, watchful,
                and obsolete, stood firm--perfect for postcards and photos
                in the manner of lighthouses seeded along the Eastern Seaboard
                and the Pacific Shorefront. Still

                water is different from other water; no two bodies the same--
                
~

                I only kissed Jo once.
                                      Tompkins Square Park. Early Spring.
                The drums of handball games a few yards away--
                four rubber balls meeting a concrete wall rapidly
                and out-of-rhythm
                                --could've been my pulse.

                ~

                How long might one want for a body,
                years? decades even? Behindme there's just a series of calendar squares
                like a sidewalk I've traveled.

                The horizon all shadows and cumulonimbus like the abdomen of a procession.

                Even the best of men second-guesses himself. The prophets.
                Crane in the water, his lungs fighting, longing for the Lower East Side again,
                or Shackleton, below deck on the Endurance
                which lay shackled by ice to the Weddell Sea: did he wish the ship
 had been commissioned to beat the U-boats
                rather than this failed transantarctic trek.

                Spring in the Northern hemisphere, already winter
                by the South Pole, bay water freezing and the ice...

                A garden of gargantuan crystalline chrysanthemums.

                ~

                No, those salty growths from the ice floes
                aren't attractive: gray masses mostly, although when the crystals
                collect the doubled light of sun and sun-on-ice, even a place abandoned
                by grass, city lights, and lovers may seem full of grace.

                And as the silver shroud of evening gets pulled across the sky
                what an improbable museum those salt sculptures must make--
                a brigade of Lot's wives.
                                          Lot's wife
                whose only sin was looking back.

I have awakened her 
when the sky was at its blackest, 
all stars erased, no moon to speak of, 
and led her down the front path 
to our dock, where we'd swim to the raft, 
finding it by touch 
fifty or sixty strokes from shore. 

And sit 
listening to things, the movement of water 
around us drawing us closer, a hunched 
double knot of child and father 
hearing all there is to hear, 
close beneath bats who see without sight, 
whose hunger is fed by darkness. 

The neighbors see her often in the woods, 
on hands and knees, smoothing the moss 
where it spreads in the shade, marvelling 
at the tongues of birds, the stained petal 
of the dogwood, the vein of color 
skirting the edge of an upturned stone. 

This morning she awoke to the first flash 
of the magnolia, and will save the petals 
as they fall, their purpled lids 
curling white on the lawn. 

We meant to tell her how the rainbows come, 
how they close into shadows, 
how we would be there nonetheless; 
we meant to tell her before 
they arrived at supper this evening, 
rimming everything in sight.

She wonders if we see them 
cupping the stars, the kitchen lamp, 
each other's face, and we say 
we do.
The thud always awakens her 
where she sits at the living room window 
gathering a shawl tight at her neck, 
her fist a pale brooch, 
its veins hard and swollen. 

She has heard it every night 
since he went overseas: 
the muddy jeep backfiring at the curb, 
his flag-wrapped body bumping to the ground, 
stars flicking light on the hedges 
as he rolls toward the house. 


  Her cane finds the corner of things 
  and she makes her way to the veranda door, 
its screen speckled with bugs 
lured by the pantry light. 

At the top step 
she shakes her stick at the darkness 
and mutters a private curse; 
she leans on the railing and takes 
each step as it comes, swallowing 
quick gulps of air and straining 
to see the lawn. 

On down the walk she goes 
to the far side of the hedge 
where the streetlamp lumps its shadows 
on the leaves. 

She pokes at the bushes and calls him 
in the voice she used above his crib 
three wars ago, pleading for her bambino, 
expecting to see him young and warm 
in his bunting, longing 
to feed at her breast. 

She unbuttons herself to the waist 
and probes among the brush, 
disturbing nothing but a squirrel, 
stiff in the leaves, the mouth 
dried open in its fur.
He is barefoot in the creek again, 
wandering between his house and the next, 
not fully awake from dreams of grenades 
blown orange. 

Clad in summer pajamas, he fondles himself 
for slivers unable to rust as they rise 
from the streams of his flesh: grey hairs 
refusing to bend. 

He enters the tunnel beneath the road 
and squats there; the cannon of his voice, 
reaching both flanks, commands the neighborhood 
to take cover. 

There are no replies from the ranks; 
the years have covered them with grass grown wild 
in memory. 

His fingers continue their search, sensing movement 
within, and succeed at his left wrist 
where a steel pricker stands rigid 
-- a miniature soldier -- the point of its bayonet 
piercing the skin for escape. 

He draws at it with his teeth and feels it 
give way; with his prisoner pinched 
between finger and thumb, he crawls with the current 
toward light. 

Caught in the death of his squad, leaving 
only the moon as a guide, 
he questions his victim, frantic to learn 
the invasion plans of those left behind 
to drain his heart. 

In the blur of morning, he watches his enemy 
twist once before curling dead 
in the palm of his hand. 

Giving him now to the stream, using a leaf as a pallet, 
he kneels to the dead man's voyage.
Drawn by a distant warmth, 
the Monarch unfolds herself 
from the silk of her sleep 
and stumbles the length of a branch 
before learning to glide 
to the darkened window 
of a grey-stoned building 
silenced for the dying. 

Unaware of glass, 
she floats through it 
and settles on the gentle rise 
of a wrist where pale tubing 
weeps within a threadlike vein. 

Lashes flutter mildly like wings, 
and the butterfly goes to them, 
landing softly on the bridge 
of the nose. 

She discovers her own image 
reflected beneath the lid, 
and passes through the eye 
to find the soul's wick 
flickering in the last 
of its shadows. 

She fans the darkness into light; 
cold ashes whirl away to memory, 
and the tip of the child's tongue 
drifts like a leaf 
to taste the sweet dust of wings 
fallen iridescent on her lips.
I. CATHERINE ANNE HANLEY

They knew scarlet fever when they saw it, 
and they saw it on her neck and arms, 
could feel it in the pulse she gave off 
as she lay in fever on her bunk twisting 
the blanket to her face, a headache 
wishing her back to Dublin, to her own 
bed, her own window where the breeze 
brought the garden inside. 

In three days it would be her ears; 
in a week she would let go 
of her fourth winter, her parents' faces 
blurring away, her sisters' eyes turning 
into stars as she eased out of pain, 
wrapped in their blankets, surrounded 
by everything she'd touched, swirling 
with her in a weighted sack, to the floor 
of the Atlantic. 

II. JAMES EDWARD HANLEY

They were told to return to steerage 
where they belonged, but stayed, 
the father's eyes ending any argument 
on deck; a tanner by trade, his hands 
were mostly leather; the arms, massive 
as country fence posts, curved 
around his family bent at the railing 
in prayer. 

In time, they asked for more blankets 
and took the children below, 
where they lay broken in the first grief
they had ever known, their mother close 
to the father, speaking in whisper, 
learning again that his strength was only 
partly his own. 

III. LAURA MARIE HANLEY

The child's third night was fitful; at dawn 
she awoke in chill; by noon the headaches 
began, the spots scattered themselves, 
and the countrymen nearest her bunk 
turned their faces to the wall. 

They were five days from shore; the hospital 
could save her; fresh vegetables and milk 
would be waiting, clean linen and gargles, 
warm baths and oils when the peeling began; 
she was less frail than Catherine, older, 
and had never been sick before. 

IV. ELIZABETH CARROLL HANLEY

She would bring her daughter through; 
after eight weeks of living in stench, 
eating like beggars, sleeping in straw, 
they would be in America where Uncle Patrick 
held a parcel of land in their name. 

She would see to it that Laura Marie would be 
with them; she would wager her life on it; 
through day and night she stayed 
with the child, keeping the others away, 
restricting her diet to soft foods, listening 
to advice from the curious and bereaved 

Until her own eyes burned, even when shut; her throat 
closed beyond words, and she lay back 
on her bunk, rubbing away the strawberry rash 
that was forming on her arms. 

V. LIZA, MARY, AND KATE HANLEY

They stayed below with their father when the men 
took the others, the men in thick masks and gloves 
who said kind things to the stretchers they carried, 
and told James to come back in six weeks, that all 
would be fine by then. 

In three hours, they were on land, walking ahead 
of him, trying not to fall down in the crowd, 
feeling his hands urging them on, steering them 
wherever the signs told him to go, his voice 
telling them all the things they wanted to hear. 

A man with a badge gave them white cards to hang 
on their coats; their common code, Han-14, 
would get them together if lost; on to the end 
of the ramp where doctors worked in rooms 
with ceilings as far back as you could lean; a man 
just ahead had his card torn in half and chalk 
scrawled on his sleeve; they took him 
out a different door. 

They held hands outside and followed their father 
to the trains; once aboard, they felt sure of things 
and fell asleep, leaving him to watch the buildings 
give way to trees; by morning, they were there. 

VI. MRS. JAMES EDWARD HANLEY AND DAUGHTER

A prayerful six weeks passed slowly in the house 
in upstate New York, but the time came to bring 
the rest of his women home; he would travel alone, 
leaving Liza in charge, and Mary and Kate 
would obey her as they would their mother, 
or he would know the why of it. 

The trip to Ward's Island was long, but he ran 
the gravel road to the hospital, stopping 
out of breath at the desk to be told 
the third floor office would have that sort 
of information; it did: 

Two entries. December, 1850, six days apart: 

                Cremated due to contagion 
          Elizabeth Hanley, age thirty-four 
          Laura Marie Hanley, age six 

The road to the depot was spotted with snow, 
his hands raw where he wrung them, each knuckle 
white at the bone. 

The last car was empty, its windows heavy with soot; 
he saw trees hardened with ice, and a sky going grey 
without clouds. He pulled the shade to the sill.
He'd learned to survive, 
but lately had taken to staying on 
after his nightly novenas, 
to kneel slouched in the front pew 
to stare up at the dead man 
screwed to the windowed wall 
and think fondly of the grave. 

He half-expected the body to move, 
the flick of an eyelid, 
a twitching thumb, a groan 
rising from the throat, maybe 
even a word, his name, something, 
anything he could hang on to. 

They took him that way; 
before he woke from his trance 
they were peeling off his socks 
for a black wad to jam in his mouth; 
he felt his shoes dangling 
around his neck; saw his undershorts 
soggy in the baptismal font, 
his cassock a costume for the one 
called Sonny, the soutane sleeves 
flapping as he whirled away 
to the loft to slash the bell-rope 
and watch it fall: a stricken snake 
coiling on the wooden floor. 

They cracked him to his knees 
and bound his wrists behind him, 
lashing them hard against his feet, 
causing old prayers to form on his lips 
to be knocked away by fists 
pulling steady on the rope they'd hurled 
over the center beam.

And up he rose to the plaster face 
where they left him upside down 
to circle the air, blood dripping 
from his nose, his stole of shoes 
bumping the silent chest, 
its painted veins swelling in votive light, 
his own beginning to pound 
in his temples; the gathered candles 
bunching his shadow on the stationed walls, 
heavy breathing and a strangled voice 
blurring in his ears, lost 
in the slow dark turning toward dawn. 
I knelt at the stump 
and kissed its inner circle 
before standing to undress: 
the sandals of vine, a robe 
the brown of aged trees. 

I saw an open place 
where my lips had been, 
like the mouth of a chalice. 

I felt its width and depth 
and went to my hands and knees 
for twigs and bits of earth 
and dropped them in the hole. 

I scanned the forest 
and lay across the stump, 
my body balanced, shaken 
by spasms that left me limp. 

I arched my back until my hair 
met the soles of my feet, 
the trunk fused to my abdomen. 

I felt my hands rise, 
fingers fluttering 
in a green blur; my head 
bursting into growth, 
hair trembling to leaf, 
flesh curling into bark; 
bird songs filling the air; 
a rush of wings 
sealing my lids to sight.
They've allowed her to stay the night, 
to sit in a metal chair 
and guard her husband's sleep, 
to watch the gauze darken at his throat, 
the hole in his neck 
rising pink around the rim. 

Sometime near dawn, she leaves him 
and heads for the double doors 
at the end of the hall; 
once inside, her fingers fly 
over the operating table. 

On the floor 
she crawls in small circles 
about the center of the room; 
she is sure she will find 
the patch of skin they took. 
She will know it by the stubble 
left on the outer side 
when she shaved him hastily 
herself this morning. 

When she finds it, she will go to him. 
She will hold the wafer up to the window, 
up to the cleansing sun; 
she will lick the edges and secure it 
to the sides of the hole 
healing open like a nostril.
Barebacked and handcuffed to a post 
in the village square of another country, 
he is about to be short-whipped a dozen times 
as she stands with her father who insists 
on pressing charges under Canadian law. 

She looks younger than she did last night, 
but older than the sixteen years he now knows her to be; 
there is time to remember it all: 

The swarming goldfish 
looking more like orange peels thrown by workers 
years before the quarry sprang a leak 
filling itself to the brim, leaving a train 
loaded with rock to rust on its tracks 
now blurred far beneath the raft 
gone lopsided by his weight. 

Before he was dry from his swim from shore, 
she was lifting herself aboard, tanned and untouchable 
as any goddess rising from the sea of a dream. 
A fish nibbled at her toes, and he shared her surprise; 
they propped their heads on their hands 
and talked for the moment it takes to know 
that there are no words. 

Lying together in the dusk, he ran his hands 
through the water, teasing the fish, her fingers 
finding his, her arms wet still and warming, her back 
stretched like young leather, softly oiled, 
her legs straight out and inching toward his until 
they gave heat the length of his body. 

They slid from the raft and swam in silence 
to the farthest rim where the pines had spent years 
preparing the shore. 

He lifted her weight and laid her down at his side 
to watch the fish pucker their mouths and turn 
from his fingertips, her eyes explaining that she'd been 
where he wished to take her, and that she knew 
he would make it seem that she'd never been there 
before. 

The only way out was the way they had come, 
back across the dark water, talking unheard, alone 
-- the beach long empty of swimmers. 

The squad car was perched like a cat in the dunes, 
hidden, until its white eyes opened a path in the sand.

Barebacked and cuffed to the post, he can see 
that the short-whip, curled loose in the sheriff's hand, 
is as tan as her legs set off brown and bare 
against her father's creased white slacks.
A fondness for birch trees 
found her poised in a patch of shade 
where the wind stays broken 
and the ground holds damp 
in a lingering fog. 

Her flared nostrils steamed 
as each sound cleared itself 
in her mind; it was here she learned 
to live-out the seasons, waking 
in half-sleep to her own bleating, 
rising from the residue of a dream 
that has her leaping a cliff, 
falling it seems forever before 
impaling herself on a branch, 
blood blowing like the rapids 
that roared up at her, until she wakes 
unharmed, unsure of things, even 
the grass where she lay. 

It was no dream that brought him to her 
in the midst of that frozen lake, 
four mongrels yelping from shore 
where they gave up the chase, the doe 
sprawled on the ice, her year-old blood 
leaking from a leg snapped in half 
when she leaped for water and found it 
gone, landing on something harder 
than the paths she'd known through woods, 
her good legs spinning her crazily 
toward the center of things. 

The ramshackle door made a raft of sorts, 
and he skidded to her side, working a rope 
for a noose; her sound was that of a child 
shaken in the night, the eyes stunned open 
in disbelief, the voice rattling 
through the windpipe, stopping in time 
to be garbled by the lips. 

He told her things she had to know 
how the rope would seem too tight, how she 
would bound on home before the morning 
even spent itself away. 

The noose settled about the neck and sent 
a shudder down her back; he moved 
as shadows move -- his hand ungloved 
and gliding toward the leg, tangled in rope, 
to set it free, to let the tug-o-war begin. 

But she had other plans, her eyes tight 
on his, a new sound snorting from her throat, 
her lunge crashing short against the door, 
giving too much weight 
for such a mild-wintered lake, and the world 
gave out beneath them. 

It was then he knew he cared only 
for himself, his wife on shore, his children 
at the window, their grandmother talking 
his death away from an earlier grief still 
thundering in her soul, his parents far 
at home, their phone readying itself 
to ring-in the news of his drowning; 
those friends feeling the Sunday air changed 
about them, the reason less than an hour off. 

All that, beyond reach, where he stood 
shoulder-deep in the shallow hole 
of a broken lake, climbing the brittle rim 
only to have it cave-in, dunking him
as often as he tried into water colder 
than he ever imagined water to be, knowing 
he would faint dead away in it, to sink 
where he had floated warm in the sun 
of past summers, alive as any man had ever been. 

And then, as though in dream, he saw his wife 
closer than before, a rope in hand, the lake 
splintering beneath her, risking all she had 
to risk, her eyes meeting his in prayer, 
the rope whirring toward him, a neighbor lugging 
a ladder, gambling his weight and age 
on the groaning surface, the long pull to shore, 
the doe left behind for those with boats 
to axe their way and save her, only to find 
her needing more than they could give, 
hauling her past the crowd, to the inner edge 
of her woods to die -- to take a single slug 
below the ear, her blood run out too far 
to claim, the freeze too deep to thaw.
He stands, greasing himself 
for the hardest swim of his life, 
the jar on a log, its cap 
fallen upside down in the sand, 
flicking splinters of sun 
on the house, all but hidden 
in the dunes, where his wife, 
his son, his daughter lie drugged 
from too much summer. 

If they were to waken 
to the quick licks of light 
playing on the walls, 
they would find him hip-deep 
in the sea, listening to the bell 
tolling from its buoy, marking 
the first leg of his journey. 

He turns and waves 
to the empty windows, ignoring 
the pain lumped hollow 
under his arm. 

He takes a last look 
along the shore and sets out 
through water colder than the lakes 
he grew up in, thicker somehow 
and darker, even the sand 
ribbed like a washboard 
seems closer as it deepens, 
his long arms churning the surface 
as though he were back home 
in the faculty pool, matching 
stroke for stroke with his office 
mate, far more than the game of it 
pushing them on to the tiles 
and back, head over heels in turns, 
neither admitting to keeping score; 
his record growing worse 
during the last of winter 
and all of spring. 

He can't help looking back 
and sees the roof silent and dry, 
its shingles shrunken now to one, 
suggesting the pace he has set 
for himself; he slows and stops, 
allowing his legs to settle 
beneath him, the buoy in sight, 
a few more football fields away. 

He imagines throwing a pass 
and watches it sail the distance 
before striking the bell, breaking 
the steady beat of it, the gong 
making the water tremble; 
he feels it across the shoulders 
and down through the groin. 

The water on his lips tastes 
more like sweat than he remembers; 
the mouthful he takes, the same 
as the gargle he used as a kid; 
he swirls it about 
and spews it out like a whale, 
lying on his back, wishing already 
for a glass of water; better yet: 
bourbon and water on the rocks, 
all on a foam tray he could push 
ahead, all the way out. 

He laughs aloud and takes 
to sidestroking his way awhile, 
easy, almost like lying adrift 
in his father's arms, learning 
to float from his fears, 
knowing vaguely his need for water, 
the clean full feeling he has 
whenever near it or in it. 

With every pull of his hand 
he can see the buoy, 
left hand passing its measure 
of water on to the right, 
the right scooping it on to the feet, 
smooth and steady until 
the boredom of it all starts 
to get him, as it always did, 
those long hours 
in the high school pool: lap 
after lap, the lungs lasting 
longer than his patience. 

In front of him are terns 
searching the waves for breakfast, 
diving straight into the sea, 
disappearing to rise empty, now 
and then a fish small in their beaks; 
eating on the fly. 

No boats returning yet, 
no one insisting he climb aboard 
and tell his tale of shipwreck 
and survival, no one ready to believe 
he could swim from shore.

On his back again, right, left, 
reaching far overhead and out, 
feet doing their work, 
leg muscles loose, no sign of cramps, 
no fatigue; left, right, left, 
just like the old days 
in the senior aquacade, the fancy moves 
showing style and endurance; 
he tries them all: the glides, 
the circle rolls, the egg beater, 
ending in the butterfly, 
both arms jacking him out 
of the water, his shoulders 
feeling the strain, too much, 
the sockets grown rusty. 

He treads water and finds the buoy, 
closer than he thought, and decides 
to race the rest of the way; 
one gulp of air and he's off, 
slap after slap, breathing 
only when breath is gone; 
he gives it everything he's got 
left, glancing ahead, 
keeping his sightline, 
the bell louder and cleaner 
all the time; he glides 
the last few feet 
and touches the casing, barely 
able to hook his feet in the rings, 
his fingers tight on the seam, 
and squints back toward home. 

He begins to shiver, convinced 
he cannot return, that the change 
in his marrow may never be known; 
he hangs on and weeps, pronouncing 
over and over the names of those 
waking on shore without him. 

He closes, at last, his eyes, 
the taste of blood draining 
from his gums, a trace welling 
in his ears, almost 
aware of the bell tolling 
softly tolling, as he slips 
back into the sea.
Two geese joined at the neck 
refuse to go the other's way 
and become themselves 
and then doorkeys 
in search of locks across the lake. 

An arrowhead has missed 
the dog's spine 
blown sky high 
and scattered among fish 
and one prehistoric bird, 
thick-winged and silent, 
owning the sun. 

The long-limbed fox is opening 
a kangaroo's pouch drifting 
ever closer to a turkey, 
one leg kicking 
at a possum in pursuit. 

Off to the west, far from fox 
and dog, fish and geese, 
the crab with transparent pincers 
floats after the wingless sparrow.
I am a beachdog dragging my notebooks 
empty across the sand. 

The palms are hung high with vultures; 
they are soundless, these birds, 
hunched and wary of any living thing, 
save the dying. 

They have blisters for eyes, and helmets 
of grey skin wrinkled about the head. 

Patient, they wait to dress the trees 
with flesh torn hot from those 
left dead in the tourist sun. 

Memory is full to boiling; 
I have come too far not to rest 
awhile, just a little while, 
in the dazzled shade of Maracas. 

The leaves move as though flexed 
by muscle; they dip 
like the heavy shadows of wings.
In the middle of the yard 
he sits on a bench 
and bangs his fists 
on the picnic table, 
pleading with closed windows 
to "call the cops call the cops 
call the stinkin' cops." 

Children from adjoining lawns 
come closer to see the beer cans 
jump like toads, leaving puddles 
that spurt under his fists 
like the spittle of dogs 
shaking their heads. 

He goes on banging and sobbing banging 
and sobbing, flailing his arms 
at the children, searching 
their blurred chests for badges, 
their heads for hats, their hips 
for guns -- something, anything, 
to save him from the banging 
of his fists. 

And now his wife appears, 
strutting like a matron, 
to unlock the garage, to crank-up 
the mower, to drown him out 
with a full tank of gas, driving 
the children back where they belong, 
where parents crane their necks to see 
her tightening her circle, roaring 
closer to the beer cans leaping, 
the fists falling and rising, the mouth 
howling without sound.
Please do not call me at home 
or expect me to drive to yours 
at any time of day or night. 

When you sit here in my office, 
please do not smoke or tear 
items from my magazines. 

Neither talk to my receptionist 
nor whistle, hum, stomp or tap 
to the piped-in music. 

When your name is called, move 
quickly to the appointed room; 
do just as you are told. 

When I enter, be prompt about 
any complaint you may have; do 
not attempt to amuse me. 

Listen to what I have to say 
so I need not repeat myself; 
then dress, taking all belongings. 

Please stop at the desk and pay 
your total bill in cash; checks 
are not welcome here; 

But you are. 
I hope you are feeling better; 
come again when you are not.
I passed your office six times today 
wanting to turn up the broken walk 
and slip inside to wait at the coat rack, 
hoping your nurse would say: well 
as long as you are here I suppose -- 

But I only looked in, recalling 
your leather table and knives, feeling 
the lump on my arm, rubbing it 
hard to make it go away. 

You will find this note when you come 
outside and will check the back seat 
and floor for me and drive off 
in the dark, your mind racing, your wife 
alone at home, miles away. 

Picture me now, my breath hot 
on your kitchen window, my eyes 
sweeping over her like a tongue.
Uninvited 
and unannounced, obsessive fears would take his head, 
causing him to whimper for hours, doubting 
the diagnostic measure of his curse. 

He grew unsure 
of the restraint they said he had by the very nature 
of the malady that seemed perpetual in its motion, 
as though a sack of unborn spiders had absorbed 
his brain. 

He was afraid 
he might do things, strange intricate things, bizarre 
as a web would be if found spun across his open eye. 

As a child 
he'd touch the handrail twice on the way down cellar 
to keep things even and never once stepped on a crack 
because he feared the certain breaking of his mother's 
back. 

He was well 
into his twenties before the vile thoughts began forming 
on the crust of the sack; it took years for them all 
to die. 

But now 
it is mostly the past twitching like the leg of a spider 
will do when pulled from its socket awhile before it dries 
to dust.
From the bus stop he goes straight 
to the closest hardware store; 
he likes hardware stores, always has; 
something to do with the iron and wood 
of the place: hinges, bolts, axe handles; 
nice to touch, to rub. 

He fondles a work glove and lays it aside, 
enjoying the smell it leaves 
on the tips of his fingers. 

He reaches a back counter to find 
three types, but sees at once the pair 
he needs; they have short rubbered-grips, 
and in the crotch, just above the connecting bolt, 
a circular section, a half moon 
on each blade; when open, the mouths 
gape at each other. 

He hands them to the clerk and waits 
for the change to come back across 
the thick wooden slab worn grey 
by a lifetime of Saturdays. 

He leaves the store and crosses 
against the light, stuffing the empty bag 
in a litter basket screwed to a pole. 

His mind goes prickly, as it always does 
in new towns, this close to action; 
he palms the cutters and walks the three blocks 
-- nodding as he goes: here to a shopper, there 
to a child on his bike, an old man rotting 
on a wooden bench bolted to the sidewalk. 

He slows his pace at the walkway, takes it 
in stride, and enters the vestibule, moving 
respectfully to the parlor on his left 
where clots of mourners ignore him. 

The rhythm in his chest picks up, his mouth 
dries out, he kneels -- crossing himself alone, 
and takes what he has come for.
Its nail needs trimming 
but if I pull the scissors 
from their case I will surely 
ease them in under the nail 
spreading a sleek white path 
back through the quick 

A week ago I slammed it 
in a door it pulsed 
and bled in my mouth 

Last night I lay for hours 
with it tucked under its hand 
flicking it out from hiding 
to flex it adjusting to the fact 
that I might someday remove it 
by the drop of the kitchen cleaver 
without a thumb a hand is less a hand 

They tense up sometimes 
as though they need something 
to do as though they might 
rise flapping from my lap 
like wings of restless birds 

On elevators I am afraid 
they will go to someone's throat 
in sleep I keep them jammed 
between my thighs and awakening 
often in the dark soak them 
long in the bathroom sink 
the coldest water turning them blue 
each finger a fish jerking 
on its hook.
He has spent another night 
walking through waves of nausea, 
balancing the pain behind his eyes 
to keep it from falling 
through the roof of his mouth 
and out onto the rug, 
showing itself to be the walnut 
he pictures growing 
in a fold of his brain. 

His coveralls will make him 
a keeper of the grounds, intent 
on doing battle once again 
with the filthy brood of pigeons 
that has called the height its own. 

He will set up housekeeping in the air, 
above the campus, where the tower's view 
of Texas is grand and clean. 

A footlocker, salvaged from a tour of duty 
still active in his mind, will contain 
provisions for the rest of his life: 
ammunition to last the day, 
rimmed by canned meats and fruit 
and a rolled towel standing white 
beside a spray deodorant. 

In the shade given back by the wall, 
he will lay three pistols, empty 
and cracked open, next to a pair of rifles 
soothed in oil, their telescopes hanging 
ready in leather sacks. 

He will give what he has to give 
to anyone in sight, 
completing the lives of fourteen strangers 
and changing the color of August 
for the dozens left to bleed. 

When it is finished, 
when his captors unfurl his towel 
and wave it above his death, 
he will join those dead as they rise 
from their scarlet shadows 
toward a dream he sent his women to: 

Where the broken bodies of mother and wife 
will mend themselves and drift in clouds, 
whispering their love for him, 
their fingers longing to soothe his brow 
still barbed in pain.
John rocks in his steel crib 
and remembers the battle plan 
that lost him his legs 
and arms and voice. 

John writes with a bulk-pencil 
strapped to his chin. 

John wanted pity at first, then 
John wanted love, then 
John wrote his ex-boss asking 
for the position of Chief 
paperweight. 

John has a page-turner now; 
better than the nose-method 
he'd used for the first five 
years; it was donated. 

John listens to the volunteers 
for just so long these days, 
and then burrows his head 
under the pillow, and comes up 
waving a small American flag 
between his teeth.
He sat in the tub, dry 
in his undershorts, his 
shirt and trousers neat 
on the toilet lid 

A new blade in the soap 
dish, a can of Drano 
in his left hand 

On top of the faucets 
the bread knife he had 
bought that afternoon 

He reached a bathroom glass 
and filled it half full 
of Drano, added all 
the water it would take 
and stirred it well 
with his finger 

He drank it down 
and nine times 
put the knife into 
his belly, next 
the razor each wrist 
often 

He left a trail to the hall 
where he crawled for help 
to live to die again.
He has taken to weeping 
while finding his way 
back to his room. 

By noon he curls up 
in a knot and squints 
himself to sleep 
for the rest 
of the day. 

Sometimes he has toast 
and milk before bed 
so he won't wake up 
in the afternoon. 

Often he showers 
before drawing the shades 
and removing the phone 
from its cradle. 

Once, unable to sleep, 
he scrubbed the floor 
with a washcloth. 

Last Tuesday, a man told him 
no one would ever hire 
anyone who wore a sweater 
under his sport coat. 

Yesterday, a man swore 
he would hire him 
within the year; he even 
put his name in his desk. 

But they can all read his face; 
it tells them what they know
already: he has gone too long; 
they are right in turning him 
back to the street.
He saw the cardinal, 
perched like a fist of blood, 
fall through his mind 
to the ground 
where the girl's body 
worked with the wind 
to form a curled drift 
that kept the river 
from rising to claim her. 

She lay as though in bed, 
one arm bent across her brow, 
the moon shading her lips 
and left shoulder. 

Puffs of snow 
had settled on her eyes 
like gobs of cotton 
younger girls use 
to shield their lids 
at summer shores. 

She was nude, 
save a stocking 
the color of sun-tanned legs 
knotted 
around her neck 
much the way she might 
have worn a scarf. 

Her hair 
flecked with night snow 
was frozen to the skin 
of a bulging root. 

Kneeling to learn her face, 
he found only frost, and rose 
to dress her warm 
in a garment of green branches.
The chapel doors are chained 
and the parents cannot get at the poet 
to stop him from reading to their daughters 
who have rented him for the afternoon. 

One woman swears she saw him 
carrying a suitcase crammed with poems, 
some sticking out of the corners 
like underwear. 

The parents have rimmed the building 
and pound it with their fists, 
growing louder by the hour; and now 
the stained glass windows are crashing 
open with borrowed books and shoes; 
but the poet will not stop reading. 

The coeds climb one another 
to shield the poet who wants to read 
his whole valise of poems. 

Parents have reached the ledges 
and are poking at their daughters 
who moan in unison, 
straining to hear the poet. 

He goes on for still another hour and stops. 
He packs his poems and puts on his hat; 
he steps to the nearest window 
where a girl smiles and opens her legs for him; 
he wraps his arms around his poems 
and crawls through her before dropping 
to the lawn where he waits for the parents 

To notice; they do and beat on him 
until he opens his case 
and gives them each a poem; there are not enough 
and he takes out pads of yellow paper 
and squats at their feet, writing more poems 
that are snatched away. 

The first readers are finished 
and rip the poems into flakes 
that settle about him like moths; 
they want more, and he writes them 

While their daughters take turns 
putting their fingers in his mouth, 
their bodies writhing in ecstasy 
as they feel the movement of letters 
closing into words.
I.

The one on our right is tuxedoed; 
the other is wrapped in a sling of burlap, 
pinned low at the hip; both are bald, 
neither is tanned, though summer is just over; 
most certainly they are brothers. 

On a stretch of bamboo, some well-used 
paraphernalia: a two-foot run 
of garden hose, a larger cut 
of steel rod, the antique thumbscrew 
seen in the advertisements, 
& a helmet, its iron straps 
crossing like the weave of a basket. 

At the back wall of the stage, hung 
in black scrims, are four shapes; 
nothing is said of them, 
but we do learn from the diapered twin 
that the brother is mute; 
we respond with applause, & the mute 
bows, extending his hand to his brother 
who affixes the thumbscrew & leads 
him to the footlights. 

He asks the front row 
to note the pressure of wood on bone; 
it is a young woman who winks 
at her companion & stands, 
giving the knob an extra turn; we stomp 
& whistle for the mute 
who is dancing on one foot, trying 
to loosen the screw that squeaks 
in its socket; he tosses it off 
to the lady who presses it hard 
to her lips. 

His brother is calling him back 
to center stage where he is struck 
on the swelling thumb, across both thighs, 
the face & top of head, the hose 
leaving welts to last the matinee. 

He limps upstage, smoothing away 
his bruises, & removes 
the first black cloth; we see 
a roughshod contraption of four legs, 
a comical horse's head 
& a backbone too sharp for sitting; 
we are told it is The Timber Mare 
of dungeon days. 

The mute drops his pants, & mounts, 
awaiting his brother's climb; 
we admire his pain, & clap till our palms sting, 
his brother balancing & leaping up 
& down on the mute's pale shoulders. 

If he could make a sound, 
it would be now, but nothing comes 
from the open mouth, and it is over; 
he is on one leg again, pulling 
his trousers on, as his brother skips 
to the second cloth, giving us 
The Rack, its huge wheel glistening 
like a spool of thread used up. 

The mute is fitted to the bottom ropes 
& cuffed to those above; he is 
asked questions of faith, & nods 
his head in answer, but none will do; the stomach 
skin stretches, the jacket slides 
up, the shirttail comes out; 
but the brother is tired of turning the stile; 
the ropes sag, the mute slumps, 
the curtain falls. 

We hurry to the lobby 
where the twins have promised to mingle, & find 
the mute somehow refreshed, the other, 
sullen against a wall, promising more 
than our money's worth once 
back in our seats. 

II. 

The houselights blink & the performers 
leave through a side door to the alley, the mute 
patting the other's back, trying 
to lift his spirit, but he'll have none of it. 

The stage looks the same; there are 
new costumes; the mute: 
leather trousers & vest, mountain boots 
laced on hooks. The other wears faded dungarees. 

Falanga is first -- the steel rod glitters 
in the mute's gloved hand, & already 
it is clear his brother 
is a poor sport; seated on one chair, 
he complains as his feet are forced into the slats 
of another; the soles face us. 

The mute begins by tapping, but now 
he is whipping, studiously, 
the rod whirring in the air, the brother 
biting his tongue, waiting it out; we count twelve 
strokes; the mute dislodges the feet, 
& the brother stays put, 
soles too puffed to stand. 

Beneath the third cloth is The Chair, 
four-wheeled & homemade, its power drawn 
from the car battery bolted to its side, two clamps 
as large & as red as needle-nosed pliers 
are attached to the skin of the Adam's apple 
& the slight roll of fat at the waist. 

The mute flicks on the head-high electrometer, 
with numerals large enough to see, & from behind 
The Chair, he eases a dial from zero to nine; 
the brother glares above us; twenty 
gets a jump, back to twelve, up to thirty-five; 
the brother braces himself, pants for breath 
when he sinks to ten, & is jerked from his seat 
when the needle hits fifty & falls; his curse 
tells the mute he has gone too far; he 
reminds him of the evening ahead on The Rack. 

The Helmet is a thumbscrew for skulls, 
& the brother adjusts it to size, his spirit 
lighter, explaining the headaches pagans 
were given; the mute smiles & takes a card 
from his vest, unfolding it for all to see 
its word: Excedrin; we applaud as he tightens 
the nut with a common wrench. 

The brother has said "enough" four times, 
but the mute is turning toward his own idea 
of enough, & the brother pulls 
at The Helmet, letting words fly unrehearsed 
through the darkened theatre. 

Now the mute glides to the last cloth, 
removing it as one might take a shawl 
from a birdcage, & it is that, exactly: a huge 
barred cage, the padlock hanging open 
on its ring; how strong the mute must be; 
he has his brother in his arms, like a child, 
knees to face, arms pinned; he sticks him 
in the cage & secures the door. 

There is much complaining, begging the mute 
to remove The Helmet, but the mute is fumbling 
with a switch; the cage starts to revolve, 
its turntable gaining momentum, as a music, 
heard often at carnivals, flows to the ear. 

The mute is bowing & clapping, leading us all 
in applause, stopping to point at the brother, 
as a conductor points at a star; spinning, 
spinning, the merry-go-round tune 
too loud to hear; we rise to our feet, 
as the curtain descends, the lights come on, 
& souvenirs go on sale in the aisle.
The drift he slams into swallows the hood; 
he rams the gearshift into reverse and listens 
to the tires burning themselves bald, the wind 
sealing the road behind; there's no going back. 

He turns off the ignition and laughs; already 
late for supper, he allots two hours for the plow 
to make its way to this back road he took at whim, 
another test of his mettle; every day more proof 
piling up, giving him strength to go on, 
surviving on memory alone. 

Forty, greying, he stuffs his pants cuffs inside 
his socks, zips his jacket to the throat 
and slips on his racing gloves, the leather 
matching his leftover tan as it shows through 
the patterned holes; he steps out into the snow, 
knowing what to do: 

The trunk opens easily, the tiny bulb giving 
light enough to work; he unscrews the spare tire 
and lays it flat on the roof, talking to it, 
explaining what it must become, his pleasure 
more proof helping to ward off the trace of panic 
he knows drifts like a shadow at the edge of the road. 

The sun visor breaks off neatly, making a scoop 
to scatter the snow from the hood; he opens it 
and unhooks the gas filter cup; he carries it off, 
chuckling, pleased, stumbling ahead to the dashboard 
where he shoves in the lighter and waits for it 
to pop. 

He pours the fuel on some crumpled paper and pokes 
the orange-coiled lighter at the center of the tire, 
pulling back at the whoosh of flame; he controls 
the fire: large enough to warm the inside of the car, 
small enough to conserve the burnables he has piled 
on the front seat: glove compartment maps, credit card 
tissues, six or seven old lists, a driver's manual, 
last night's newspaper, and two man-sized Kleenex 
he stuffed in his pocket at home this morning. 

Already proud, his lips twitch as he realizes 
there are yards of cardboard lining any car's 
insides; he thinks of the look his insurance man 
will have on his straight-lipped face when he sees 
the car in the morning, destroyed for salvation; 
the papers will surely do a story, pictures, quotes. 

He dismantles both headlights, leaving their wires 
attached, and props them in the snow, aimed skyward, 
and gets back in the driver's seat flicking them on: 
high low off on, a perfect signalling system for any 
snowmobilers, roaring drunk through virgin drifts 
laced with fence posts and abandoned jalopies; 

He knows the papers will set his next move in bold 
type; off comes the oil filter, on goes the lubricant: 
face, hands, back of neck, deep into both ears, 
explaining aloud to tomorrow's reporters the need 
for layers of oil, how vulnerable the hairless human 
ear is to chill, the fragile pink fading to swollen 
grey, yellowish white. 

He sees a quarter-page photograph of himself 
in a ridiculous hospital gown, pillowed-up in bed, 
smiling faintly to his left; again the visor 
shoveling snow high against the wind, leaving only 
his door open a crack to keep the lock from freezing; 
back inside he flicks on the dome light and breaks 

The rearview mirror with pliers, close at the edge 
so it splinters, giving him three thin blades 
to strip the ceiling, allowing the tire's heat 
to come in; he slashes holes in the back seat, 
enough for feet and hands, another for shoes 
and socks; he waits until he warms, pleased 
with everything he's done. 

But he knows there must be more to do; he studies 
every inch of his room, trying for the extra touch 
that will give the newspaper boys a headline, 
a handle for a feature; he smiles and begins ripping, 
wielding the glass like a scalpel: 

Floor mats, lining, seat covers -- and fashions a suit 
of clothes: mittens and hat, scarf and shawl, pants, 
boots, all jammed full of seat stuffing, tied loose 
with seat belts and shoelaces; he will explain he was 
about to make a pair of snowglasses out of the back 
directional cups but they found him too soon. 

He dresses and goes outside, removing his hand-guards 
to feed the fire another slab of cardboard, recalling 
the way he dropped envelopes by the dozen 
into the corner mailbox three weeks ago, almost late 
but close enough for Christmas; close enough 
is the way he likes it, always has. 

He refuses to look at his watch; he knows 
it has all taken too long -- clever but not clever 
enough to take up the slack between the car and plow; 
he curses the driver perched on his stool in some 
two-bit diner, sipping coffee spoiled with milk, 
a greasy doughnut ringing his finger, his boots 
running snow, puddles forming on the linoleum, 
streams wider than the shoelaces binding his leggings, 
twisting toward the door, urging him up and out. 

He hears him brag on about the weather, the way 
he blasts it off the roads, how he's beaten his own 
record already: only five back roads to go, 
and the snow coming so fast he may forget about them 
and start over from the beginning -- no one in his 
right mind would travel those others on such a night 
anyhow. 

He tastes a second cup of coffee hot in the back 
of his brain, trying to suck it down; he moves his eyes 
to the rearview mirror, hoping he is wrong, 
planning to see the glaring lights of the plow picking him out 
of the night, but he sees only a few flakes of glass left 
on the flat tin backing. 

He leaps within himself, remembering the car top, 
clawing the air toward the tire, finding its blaze 
dead, its ashes wet and done for; he gets back 
in the front seat, turns the key hard to the right, 
hears a rattle and remembers the hood wide open, 
the motor, the battery covered with snow; he says 
nothing, but takes the tire down from the roof 
and puts it back in the trunk, still open, its snow 
swirling up at him. 

He decides to leave the headlights where they are 
and gets back inside, locking the door behind him; 
piece by piece by piece he pushes all the stuffing 
he can find back into place, regretting the damage 
he's done to the cushions and walls and ceiling. 

He sits behind the wheel, and for the first time 
becomes aware of snow leaking in where the vent latch 
is gone; within the hour, frost starts forming 
on his cheek, flakes fall on his left shoulder, the bulb 
overhead continues to fade. 

With fingers strangely warm, he pulls the headlight knob 
and lowers his foot to the pedal: on-off, on-off, 
imagining the beams changing their tilt 
somewhere beneath the snow.
I rise from the sun-deck 
to enter the thicket 
in search of a bouncing ball, 
and find instead a grenade 
rolling toward a thatched hut. 

And I go deep within it: 
my eyes dropping to a sling, 
hung from criss-cross poles, 
supporting a child, sleeping 
above the settling ball. 

The concussion blows the roof off 
like a puff of dandelion fuzz: 
gently, not to waken the infant 
wrapped in flame and floating 
slowly, head over heels through leaves. 

I watch until he burns away in the sun.
A man just died under my nose; 
he sat down on the pavement 
eleven stories below 
and tried to hold his heart 
in place, as I leaned out 
to watch him die, careful 
to clutch the sill 
so I wouldn't beat him 
to death in mid-air. 

I closed the blinds, 
but not in time to keep 
his wife and children 
from screaming 
in the center of my desk.
The dead rise in memory to fix 
their eyes on rooms gone empty 
without them; they swell like balloons 
on the airy lips of children. 

They will find you alone, at night, 
seated in darkness; say nothing 
save their names; no greeting, 
no words of disbelief, only the names. 

They will sense your trust, 
taking the breath from the walls, 
tasting the carpet for salt 
left from the tears you spilled. 

You will hear them behind the chair, 
parting the fabric, arranging themselves 
in the stuffing, sitting atop one another 
in your position; the slightest pressure 
beneath your legs, against your back, 
will tell you they are there. 

Speak their names soothingly, time 
and again; by dawn you will feel 
frantic motion and then nothing at all. 

Turn all lights on; open all windows; 
look for the yellow taint of heat, 
the slight marks where the cloth 
has been fused. 

On the third day, inscribe a thin cross 
on the seat cushion, and bum the chair 
where it stands, intoning the names 
as softly as your voice allows; watch 
for shapes in the flame, in smoke. 

Only then will you see them clearly, 
bursting a moment beyond recognition.
He once dreamed of burning this house 
       rather than bicker with his sisters 
       over the relics of her life. 

But she had her way, as mothers do, 
       and he followed her shadow 
       through endless rooms 

All the while digesting the words 
       that described the last remains 
       her daughters must share with him 

Like mice sniffing their larder 
       in darkened pantries; 
       there's a hutch 

For a breezeway, the dry-sink 
       for a cluttered kitchen floor, 
       a kidney-desk and wing chair 

Waiting like tombstones 
       to crowd a pitiful living room; 
       the spoolbed, the sleighbed 

The chest of drawers ready to warp 
       and flake in the rafters 
       of a desolate garage. 

When she's gone, they'll be back 
       to handle things 
       and claim her 

Lefthand diamond, to lock the house 
       and remove those 
       crystal doorknobs.
She was eager to be heard and nibbled on memories, 
while I listened to the mournful chewing, and 
scraped the last puddle of vanilla ice cream 
from a deep-bottom dish with a silver-black spoon. 
The wool-wrapped legs barely showed but bulged 
beneath uncountable layers of arctic skirts 
safety-pinned each day against the imaginary freeze. 
There were always cookies in the pickle crock 
and Pepsi in jelly jars during those hours together 
in that fear-fed neighborhood on the fringe of Lake Erie. 

I remember her padding blindly about, 
in her frayed maroon slippers, pressing dustballs 
and giant hairpins into the silent carpet; 
a copper-colored gas heater pumped itself year 'round, 
and the temperature held to its constant eighty-five, 
having leapt there once many years before. 
The sun would sear its way through two paper shades 
that were drawn and tacked against the eternal glare, 
as I'd read to her from the accumulated mail, 
a slim stack forever staling in open envelopes. 

And then the men came -- 
they tapped at the windows, 
took the tacks from the shades, 
broke the ice cream bowls, 
hid her slippers, 
unpinned her skirts, 
stole her mail, 
and sat on the table-top to taunt her. 
Only finger-tip tall, they were never seen, 
but she assaulted them daily, fiercely. 
In the end, they went away, leaving her alone 
with the fear that they might return. 
She died in her sleep without them.
Those eyes refused to stay indoors; 
instead, they rode their own cataracts 
and washed ashore at the foot 
of San Juan Hill in time to watch 
eighteen hundred men lace their boots 
in Grandma's darkened sunporch. 

From my vantage point 
on Great Uncle's lap, I heard 
General Shafter address his troops 
and lead the attack. 

Uncle Steve followed him and left me 
alone in the lowlands, 
already cluttered with legs 
of understanding relatives 
and a green hassock, frayed but firm 
enough for a warrior's foothold. 

Grandmother took my hand 
and hurried out of the war zone, 
as Uncle Steve ranted on and rode off 
into combat somewhere near the front 
door shining with its double lock 
of inescapable security.
There is no hi-hat, but he finds one 
in the air around his knees 
and keeps the offbeat 
while his supper tray jiggles on his lap, 
taking the beating he gives it 
with crossrods from two wooden hangers. 

They keep him downstairs 
so those wrapped in silence 
along the upper walls won't complain 
about paradiddles accompanied 
by the rudimentals of ma-ma-da-da 
and the barefooted thud tap thud, 
thud tap thud, of a man 
at work. 

A radio drifts in from the ward 
overhead, and wood takes on straw 
as clothesbrushes move across plastic, 
scratching a chee-chaa from the thirties. 

He watches his face in waves of glass 
and smiles through stubble; he sees 
his nursemaid swallow her laughter 
and tuck him back to bed 
to watch his life spin across the ceiling 
and down the wall, finding itself 
again in the cracked and shadowed 
mirror.
An hour, maybe two, was all he had 
before he left; he wouldn't look 
at any of the things he'd made 
from dreams before it all went bad. 

He wanted to know: 
would we replace the wooden icebox; 
might the cabin become another house; 
were we able to close a place for winter. 

He taught us to cut limb-poles 
big around as an upper arm, 
and prop them in under joists, 
over the main floor beam, to keep 
the roof from caving in. 

We learned to make shutters 
for the drifting snow, and how to nail 
higher windows shut against hunters 
looking for a stopping place. 

We wouldn't have thought of mothballs 
for the floors to ward off mice, 
or antifreeze for the sinks & bowls & tank, 
or screening for the drain hose 
where bugs swarm throughout the fall. 

Before he left, he pointed out the spot 
where we might chain our own canoe 
upside down under the cabin, 
where it would wait dry for the lake 
until it finally thawed somewhere in spring.
It was more like a dream than an ending, 
the lawn chairs adrift on the grass, 
the elm trees parting politely 
so that ladies kept waiting might pass 
before Bartlett returns from the pantry 
where he's won some affection at last. 

They enter the lake without Bartlett, 
and settle down in the sand; 
the windows are closed, except Bartlett's, 
the handle comes off in the hand; 
and Bartlett goes right on romancing, 
knowing that they'll understand. 

They sit as they sat as they waited 
for Bartlett in fine livery 
who's taking them all Sunday driving 
and bringing them back for tea, 
but Bartlett has conquered some virtue 
and lingers inside wistfully. 

And now though he's diving to find them, 
and even holds open the door, 
there is little to say of his sorrow 
as he floats them each back to the shore 
where the others have come to verandas 
to see the five ladies once more.
We'd hitch out from town, 
over the bridge and across 
the island's baking dust to the dockside 
tavern where we'd see, 
through rusted screens, the same lost men 
bent at the bar, their day's ration 
of coins spilled before them. 

They'd watch us strip to our trunks 
on the pier, plastered 
with no-swimming signs, cursing 
our miserable youth to themselves, 
treading their way toward dusk, 
a swallow at a time. 

A riverboat of sorts was marooned there, 
a hideout for rats, but we'd take over 
the second deck, standing three-high 
on each other and topple as one 
into the dark Niagara, coming up 
draped in garlands of slime. 

Adrift in memory is that faceless man 
who set aside his beer 
and mumbled onto the dock to climb 
to the highest tier. 

We knew the black water 
like the inside of our mouths: 
the cable-locks and every underwater 
point where holding-piles grew 
like stunted oaks. 

We yelled our warnings and watched 
him leap, tumbling like a bag of bones. 

He hit six inches of water, 
forty foot of wood, hooked somehow 
by the seat of his pants 
like a bar rag ready to ge wrung out 
and carried back inside 
where it belonged. 
He hanged himself last night 
       quiet in his own cellar 
       while his wife tidied up 
       the kitchen overhead. 

She called his name softly, 
       aware of the pain 
       that had hung in his head 
       since the fall last spring. 

She called a second time 
       and dried both hands 
       on her apron as she pattered 
       down the stairs to find him 

Swaying from a nylon cord knotted 
       hard against the sewer pipe; 
       he must have stood there 
       silent on his toolbox 

And kicked himself free, plunging 
       feet first into darkness, 
       flushing the ache from his life 
       like a house-moth caught 

In the swirl of a bathroom bowl.
The papers report 
that you have been found 
drifting and bobbing 
fifteen days downstream 
from where you broke 
the November silence 
and slipped 
from no one's sight. 

Heavy with death 
you rose from the riverbed, 
layers of fish parting 
to allow your passage 
through their gaze 
before giving you up 
to the eyes of a man 
facing his Sunday alone 
along the shore. 

You are landlocked now 
in dry clothes and candlelight 
close to those you leave 
to drown 
in the wake of your going. 

Tomorrow, the hole in the Hudson 
will heal.
Arnie, you were just too short 
for your own good; 
nothing could make you tall: 
not the extra heels nailed 
drunkenly to both shoes, hidden 
by dungarees dragging the floor, 
your chef's hat rising a foot 
overhead, that bowery face 
somehow always in pain, 
those snakes curling their ink 
the length of your arms; nothing, 
not even the milk crates 
you walked like a bridge 
in front of the stoves, tending 
the burners like a man 
too tall for such a bend; 
nothing did anything, Arnie, 
but remind us that the inches 
you mourned were somewhere 
beyond that mountain 
hell-hole of pots and pans 
where you always came up short.
When death comes, it will find them 
here where we tucked them away 
like used kleenex, she in one wing 
he in the darker, she to a suite 
of carpets and drapes and her name 
on the door, giving a confusion of home. 

His room is as grey as mouseskin, 
the warped linoleum adding only 
a trim of blue-black flowers 
to the bottoms of walls; 
the windows are sealed 
yet the screens are intact 
in this ward for the terminally ill. 

Her hair has been cut 
to suit the fashion of the place; 
the clothes she came in 
have been washed and laid to rest 
on a shelf she can't quite reach; 
she obeys like the others 
and wears the pantsuits she found 
swaying on velveteen hangers 
in her closet of gold-rimmed mirrors. 

His wardrobe is his own: 
the same flannel shirt tucked 
in dark green trousers, the 
cigarette hole at the crotch 
still light around the rim. 

She eats her meals on her side 
of things, with plush pile chairs 
and tin chandeliers and fourteen 
plastic flowers all in a row. 

He dines at the end of his hall, 
raising his hand for service 
or a push to the lobby to meet her, 
his slippers dragging ahead 
of the wheels. 

She has permission to leave 
her sector to join him, and does 
most days, taking her place 
at his side, where they wait 
watching the door.
He feels the catheter as penis, 
is pleased with its sudden growth, 
and goes to great lengths fondling 
what he can't raise his head to see; 
"Pinocchio" says I; and the urine 
trickles to its holding bag. 

In a haze that won't describe itself, 
he sees the bottles above his head, 
and wonders what good they do; 
"Oil change" says I; and the drops 
fall to his arm and in; 
"Smart Ass" says he; "You bet yours" 
says I, and the toes of one foot 
move the sheet in pleasure. 

They like him here; like his bark, 
the way he tells them why 
they feel so smug, well enough 
to baby him, reminding them 
they'll be in a crib some day; 
"Time's coming" says he. 
"Whatever you say, Henry -- whatever." 

"Damn right" says he. Cancer or no, 
he says it out: the chaplain on rounds, 
gold watch and fob and vest, 
comes puffing in to ask How-are-you-doing- 
today-Henry? "Dying, thank you" says he. 
What-is-your-line-of-work-Henry? 
"English professor" says he. Oh-I'd- 
better-watch-what-I-say, he says. "All 
self-conscious people say that" says he. 
Well-have-a-nice-day, he says. 
"Amen" says he. 

He still has his own mustache, and wants 
to know what the plastic one does; "Oxygen 
without the tent" she sings; "Enjoy it 
like a breath of spring." -- "Awful" says he. 
"Behave" she says. "Beat it" says he. 
"Please leave for a while" she says; 
"I want to do his bedsores." -- "Live it up" 
says I. "Smart Ass" says he. "Yours, 
at the moment" says I. "Bet yours" says he; 
and she rolls him off his rubber ring. 

          The lounge is empty, the magazines 
older than a barbershop's; nothing 
changes -- faces smile and frown, open 
and close; gossip and death survive. 

Now he is propped on his side, his rump 
healing in open air; the phone 
rings from Alaska; the voice is hard 
to place, but her name makes the catheter 
jump on its hook. "She doesn't know" 
says he; "It's been years." -- "I'll write her" 
says I. "Leave her be" says he. "Like hell" 
says I; he shakes his head 
in mock dismay, and sleeps in snow 

For a matter of minutes, waking 
in an old dream with three women naked 
on a parched lawn, holding him down 
in a shallow pine box; he's cold 
and yelling for help. "Why 
wouldn't you come; where were you?" 
"Right here; it's all right, 
I'm right here." Again sleep, longer, 
deep enough to send me home. 

Route 59 is slurred with rain; cars dead 
along the curbs; the stink of the ward 
hangs on. 

The clock on the mantel clangs time 
and again, the phone wakens the house, 
a nurse talks from his room: he's confused, 
thinks he is lost, would I talk him 
back to sleep, do what I can. 
"It'll be okay, Henry; it's just 
a dream, like the box on the lawn; 
the nurses will get you blankets, 
and tuck you in, get you more milk, 
one of those whopping pills; let me talk 
with her again; you'll sleep, 
you'll see." -- "My ass" says he. 
"No thanks" says I; "I saw it this afternoon."
He has chosen fifteen 
from the side of the track, 
and now the sixteenth; 
he shakes them 
in his cupped hands 
like a man rattling bar dice 
after his money is gone. 

They are all about the same: 
grey, smooth, just as they were 
a year ago when he'd run 
four miles before breakfast 
-- in rain, snow, summer heat, 
no matter. 

He watches the runners, 
different yet the same, 
sweatshirts wet on their backs, 
legs pounding the stones in place, 
a sudden burst of speed 
as they pass by, nodding his way 
with the nod a newsboy gives 
with change, cautiously, 
making sure his fingers don't 
touch your palm. 

He's wanted to come here 
to the grandstand, stark 
in its concrete 
and bolted slabs of wood, 
and the stones -- most of all 
the stones; 

He remembers how he'd fondle them, 
flicking one away each time 
he finished a lap, running 
flatout with the last one 
tight inside his fist, 
keeping it, storing it away 
with the others at home. 

The runners are at the far bend 
and coming hard -- they will pass him 
again, where he stands aside, 
feeling the stones tumbling 
in the dark 
he has made of his hands.

He's made the flight before, 
but never in a wheelchair strapped 
back-to-back to the last seat in tourist, 
within earshot of a leggy stewardess 
complaining of a rough night in Cincinnati. 

The secret he's kept in his abdomen 
feels like a loaf of bread swallowed whole, 
deep in its wraps of flesh and blankets, flexing 
its tendrils from hip to groin, sedatives 
cooling it down. 

He's cold enough to be naked; sure enough 
that he's going to explode 
that he almost asks for help, but forces 
sleep instead. He wakens 

To a sinking feeling that takes him aground. 
And then a ride flat out 
on a canvas litter whose wheels 
squeal through the carpeted tunnel, 
clearing the way to the terminal with its ceiling 
wide as a ballpark. Outdoors they hit 
a wind worse than Lake Erie. 

Up a rattly old ramp to a hospital van, 
complete with a wall of bottles and tubes 
and a lanky bag of oxygen draped over its tank. 

The trip from LaGuardia 
reminds him of Verdun, the back roads, 
the afternoon of forest patrol in the Argonne, 
birds escaping like soot in the sky, safe 
from the low cloud of mustard gas sniffing 
at his leggings, finding the sweat it needed 
to bring him to his knees. 

The volunteer at his side looks more 
like a street-sweeper, white coveralls baggy 
as a clown's, but she knows what he needs 
to hear: Deep-breathe when the pain comes; 
Exhale it slowly away; Go limp at the bumps: 
potholes that could hold their own 
in a minefield. 

At dusk, they'd settle into the trenches, 
scraping hollows in the front wall, and sit 
with the war behind them, heads to their knees, 
helmets tilted back in case 
shell fragments caught them off guard. 
The thought makes him shudder, 
and he looks at the bulb overhead, wishing 
he could cup it in his hands. 

She wants to help and assumes 
it's a bother. She flicks it off, bringing 
the night inside; he takes it in both 
eyes, adjusting to it, anxious to see out 
the windows of the double back doors. 

There are punctual bursts 
of arc-lamps, truckers flashing their brights 
to pass, billboards lit up 
for late commuters. 

She is telling him what they will do 
at the curb: the unlocking, the lift, the cold 
air and nurses waiting to lead him to a stall, 
the questions they will ask. She warns him 
of the entryway: heaters jutting 
from the tiles, an unearthly orange glow 
everywhere. 

She is calling ahead, giving 
estimated arrival time; she spells his last name, 
his first, and remembers the PH in Stephen. 

The roads curve more in town, just as they did 
in Verdun: three weeks in bed, 
pampered and groomed. This 
will be a shorter stay: The end of the line, 
he says to the hand at his face. 

The van stops, lurches once 
in each direction. The motor runs on, feeding 
exhaust through the floorboards. She is up 
from her jumpseat, putting a shoulder 
to the door. 

The blankets are olive drab to his chin. 
Strangers take him up and out, 
held for a moment 
on a rush of cold air 
before turning headfirst 
into a corridor of orange light. 
He remembered to ease back on the key 
before turning to the left.  It clicked 
open and the tin weatherstripping creaked 
as he stepped inside.                      

Something rushed over him; he went to his knees 
and found himself making the sign of the cross: 
forehead, breastbone, shoulder, shoulder. 
It was as though he'd tried to take a breath 
underwater. He stayed put 

And pushed the door shut without looking 
back. He was staring at the red-ribbed chair 
where his father should be, the slippers 
under the footstool, a brown cardigan laid 
over the armrest for a moment 
three weeks ago.  In front of him 

Was the blanket his mother kept            
on the davenport for the naps that gave her 
strength for lunch at the kitchen table. 

The door swung in at his touch, settling 
against the side of the stove. There were dishes 
in the drainer, and others left undone 
from that last breakfast: two coffee cups 
and saucers, a napkin folded at its place, 
a plate whose toast was gone.

The door to the back hall was closed, 
the skeleton key dangling on its rubberband 
from the doorknob. He opened it a crack 
and listened; the refrigerator hummed 
at full blast. Inside, he saw a half loaf 
of bread, some eggs in the door-rack. Three 
covered bowls held leftovers from October. 

The backdoor key was where it belonged, 
on the cuphook near the dustpan. He took 
the four steps down and started outside, but 
came back in and latched the storm door, 
leaving the other ajar. He went downstairs, 
flicking the switch with the jolt it always needed. 

Near the furnace, beneath the bare bulb, 

  he took out the list. At the washtubs, he pulled 
  the lightstring and squatted at the hot-water 
tank, thumbing the dust from the dial. 
He forced it left and heard the pop. 

There were three shirts and a nightgown 
on the clothesline that stretched to the fruitcellar. 
He dragged his hand across them and turned 
the handle of the door he'd helped build. 
It needed an upward yank. The high window 
was black with paint, but the ceiling switch, 
once too high to reach, sent light across the shelves 
of canning jars, their rubber rings dried out 
in open tins, pans, vases, trays, cardboard boxes 
wilting along the seams. 

He took the stairs one at a time, almost 
starting to count them, but picked up a clothespin 
instead. He carried it to the landing and set it 
down on the top rim of the milkchute. 

Out back, the garage door was locked, the key 
out of sight. The lawnmower was wrapped 
in oily canvas, the patio chairs stacked 
in the corner, the awning rolled, the chipped 
white basin still half full of sand for grandchildren. 
The red shovel, his own, there on its nail 
for fifty years. He lowered the door 
and headed for the house, wondering if anyone 
saw him, if he should wave.

On the sunporch, he opened the drapes 
and attached a timer to the radio. Two others.
One for the floorlamp at the foot of the stairs,
and the last, the guest-room reading light.
New bulbs for both.   

His parents' bedroom door was closed.
He wished he could keep it that way. Inside, 
the gooseneck lamp bent low over a saucer  
with a spoon upside down in a dried puddle.
A small brown bottle stood close to its cap, 
its label toward the wall.              
He made the bed and hung his father's robe
on the back of the closet door. The armoire 

Was locked. The strongbox was safe  
on the bottom shelf, its key in the sock drawer.                  
There was more than he'd supposed, but he took it 
all, filling the suitcase with deeds and stocks, 
wills and bonds. He closed 

  the double doors and locked them. 
He sat on the bed and started to give in 
to everything around him, but shook it off                   
and went to his mother's side of the room.  Things
were in order. She'd probably stayed awake
that last night, tidying and sorting, 
vaguely agreeable, unaware she was walking
through the house for the last time.

He could see the backyard from their window.
It was filling up with snow. He emptied both
drawers of jewelry into a second suitcase and sat 
on the bed. He lay back and let it come, all 
the summer visits he'd spent there, the talks 
with his father, the papers that would take over 
at his death: what would become of Mother, 
the house, the land. 

There was a washcloth next to the sink 
and he soaked it. He buried his face in it. 
He wrung it out and took a towel 
from the linen closet. He left the cloth to dry 
on the edge of the tub and dropped the towel 
down the laundry chute, 
wondering what would become of it. 
It fits his hand as it had his father's 
hand, extra lead stashed inside 
beneath a rubber-plug eraser; he'd worn it 
clipped in his vest pocket, its arrow, 
gold and etched, catching light 
as it came toward his desk. 

Stolen once from the mantle, 
by stick-burglars as we slept, it showed 
up at the local precinct, flicking light 

  from the captain's badge-pocket 
  as he leaned back in his chair. 

After that, it stayed upstairs at night, 
weighing lightly down the clean white 
handkerchiefs Mother starched and ironed 
and stacked in the chifforobe drawer. 

The vests are gone, left in plastic bags 
with their suits in the Salvation Army shed 
at the edge of town, but if the men 
who wear them now ever pull the pockets 
inside out, they'll find no marks; 
he always turned back the lead. 

In the strongbox, there are penciled notes, 
rough drafts to the bank and hospital: 
something about his pension, directions 
forbidding the removal of his larynx, and one 
which reads in part: 

"If I am the first to go, Kathleen, 
it is important for you to know, 
that we haven't any debts 
other than the normal monthly bills. 
We have no debts of any kind. 
I have not authorized 
any delivery of goods or services."
It is always the same: he is far upstate 
where the roofs and lawns 
are collecting snow. 

The sunporch light 
is holding his father's profile 
to the window. His mother 
is turning away 
from the oval frame of the front door. 

He hurries away unseen, 
feeling he has business farther down 
the block, but stops at the edge 
of the next driveway and goes back, 
taking the privet hedge 
in one leap, dragging the left foot 
as he used to do in the high hurdles 
at the cinder track 
on the other side of town. 

He lands close to the drain vent, its cap 
an inch or two above the grass; 
he kneels and sees it is the same 
perforated lid he scarred on Saturdays 
with the handmower. 

He taps at the window 
next to his father's chair and reads 
his lips as he mouths the nickname he used 
for a lifetime. He puts his hand 
flat to the glass, expecting his father 
to do the same, measuring hand 
to hand, but his hand is alone, the fingers 
feeling the grit that swirls in the air 
in that part of the country. 

He looks deep into the house. The rooms 
are empty. His father's head is cut 
from cardboard and stuck to the glass. 
A single dab of flour paste, still wet 
as milk, begins its run 
down the cold clear pane between them.
The fresh drifts slant like poured salt 
against the picket fence. Voices, 
familiar to the room, suggest 
an earlier season: 

                      There is a man bent to his garden, 
                      the first warmth come early 
                      to his back, muscular 
                      as the earth he kneels in. 

                      Across the lawn, her left hand 
                      cupped like a vase, a woman 
                      gathers lilies of the valley, each bell 
                      ringing to her touch. 

And then they are gone. Nothing 
but birds at the kitchen window, three 
of them perched in twin evergreens, 
fluttering snow from the heavy branches. 
He used to wrestle it up 
the side of the house with his son; 
leaning from ladders, hand over hand 
they'd go, a rung at a time, 
the bulk of canvas collapsing at last 
into its storage box for the winter: 
that warehouse coffin of a thing 
nailed to the clapboards and studs 
high against the outside wall. 

And then his grandson took his place 
while he, cardiac arms overhead, stood 
stiff on a patio chair 
beginning the roll, until he was left 
below, turning the air between us, 
the green cracked cloth getting away 
from him, the silver bars caging him in 
from the sky, the silver bars 
naked to the autumn heat come to tease 
him toward a season he would never need 
an awning for, an awning whose shade 
would be given away to strangers 
none of us would ever know. 
He dials his dead father's house  
where timers go off at noon, at dusk,
at nine, allowing the gooseneck lamp 
to come on in the den, the radio                    

  to sift through the kitchen walls 
  and awaken the neighbor's dog,    
who no longer waits at the side door  
for scraps.

Six rings -- Mother 
would have answered by now, 
but she's kept in a vest that is tied 

  to a chair in the rest home he chose 
  from a list when he was in town.

Twenty rings, and counting:
the pilot light flickers in the stove,  
a cobweb undulates                      

  imperceptibly above the sink, the crystal 
  stemware chimes in its breakfront. 
He closes his eyes and listens.  
He would like to say something,
but there is nowhere 
to begin.
O, Father, 
there on the tallest star, 
I promised you too much 
for my own good. I cannot go 
daily to your wife. 

I try, instead, to stop by 
once a week to wheel her down 
the double ramps in time 
for lunch, if I'm intact enough 
to get beyond my own impending age 
which closes in like winter chill 
about my legs. 

She is in great comfort: fed 
well, bathed lovingly, talked to 
and watched, given flowers 
to arrange and plants to keep 
alive. I am never 

Her son; sometimes a brother, 
a schoolmate whose name 
she can't recall, and once, 
a month ago, I spent an hour 
as her father. She thinks 
she is at home, that you 
are about to enter every door.
He backs out the nails 
but the railings hold fast, ingrown 
on the tracks of a ruined oak 
rising half dead on the moonlit side 
of the lawn. 

On a crisscross of scraps and tenpenny nails, 
he finds the initials they carved without him 
in the glare of a dimestore lantern 
long gone from the hook 
that gives way at his touch. 

He dismantles it all, piece by piece, 
sailing each hunk to the foot 
of the ladder strapped to the tree. 

The roof has worn away; 
only a strip of canvas puckers along 
its hem of tacks; he takes them 
one at a time. 

Finished, he climbs down and sits 
on the boulder he used to hope 
they would miss 
if they fell from their sleep. 

He looks up at too many branches, 
too much sky, and begins 
to do what he taught them to do 
when they begged for a place 
of their own in the leaves. 

He collects all the wood 
he can hold and goes back up 
to rebuild the past: each board 
falling into place, its nails returned 
without question. 

At midnight, he unties the ladder 
and lets it slide away to the ground; 
he lies flat out, extending his arms 
and legs, until he is touching 
the trunks of four oaks, 
spread-eagle in the middle of the night.
Supper tonight was served by strangers 
in a truckstop far from the kitchen sink 
where his mother stood watching him back out 
over gravel, too close to the oak he scraped 
more than once on those late nights they warned 
him about. Perhaps he's had enough. 

His room is fast becoming a shrine: clean linen, 
homework arranged near his books, fresh flowers 
at the door, new pajamas folded at the pillow 

  he should come home to, and the lamp: its limp Christ, 
  with a 7 1/2 watt candle in His fist, nailed 
to the window jamb. 

The father wakens in the night and carries a drink 
upstairs to disturb the room. He feels the bed, 
empty in the half-light. He flicks off the lamp 
and studies the shapes of his son's belongings, 
hoping to find things missing, but they are there. 

The B-29 they built together 
holds on to the sky by a thumbtack the size 

  of a button on a puffcoat, the one his son wore 
  the last time he saw him slamming out 
through the pantry, his answer cut off 
by the banging of the door. 

He needs another drink, but lies down 
instead, his head sinking in 
where his son's should be. In what approximates 
sleep, he hears a voice behind the bed. 
He rouses to speak his name, to coax him back home, 
but sunlight comes to wash it all away.

He scatters the homework and curses his wife 
and her fastidious shrine. Downstairs 
it is the same. No one will look at him. They know 
he's been drinking. He leaves them alone 
and goes off to his den, to his tall window, 
his son behind the mower, the hedge 
fencing him in on three sides. But it is only 
a tree moving in the snow. 

He hears his wife and daughter in the hall, 
their quiet voices keeping the walls from falling in. 
They shout Goodbye and leave for the day. 
He feels better already. He pours himself a drink 
and heads for the yard, in search of kindling 
felled by the winds that worked all night. He sets 
the empty glass at the edge of the woods and goes in. 

Loaded to the chin, he comes to the front 
of the garage and lays a fire as his son would 
have it: twigs tangled like a bird's nest, 
sticks forming an open box, and narrow limbs 
the size of rake handles to finish it off right 
in the middle of the driveway. 

Inside for a clean glass, bourbon, and ice. 
And then the flame: the first strike does it. 
The kitchen match goes white and orange and blue. 
But he is gone, back inside, 

Upstairs at the window, jamming the storm sash up 
as far as it goes. And now it begins. Here come 
the pillows and sheets and blanket. A shelf wrenched 
from the closet wall. The straightback chair 
breaks when it hits the cement. The desk 
is too big and takes the windowframe with it: 
glass and putty sailing like ice and snow. 
The single mattress bounces when it hits. The box 
spring cracks once and falls to its side. 

And now a wait while the rug is rolled 
and lowered by its fringe. 

Here, the pajamas unfolding. Homework flying 
like kites, books by the dozen flapping 
to the ground. The model plane is off its tack, 
heading for the fire. 

Drawers and their sweaters are on their way, 
a closet floor of shoes and boots, shirts, jeans 
by the armful, jackets and ties, two stereo speakers, 
a double rack of albums, lacrosse sticks 
and helmet, bedsides and headboards, a clock 
trailing its cord, a hockey stick and floor lamp 
with shade still attached, a calendar 
turning its month over at last. 
She felt the snowfield break beneath her boots, 
heard the boom as the fracture spread eight, nine 
hundred yards left and right across the ridge. 

She remembered to drop her poles and kick off 
her skis; she even tried swimming awhile, 
but started to gag and rolled herself up, 
her face tight in her mittens, the roar 
working to cram her mouth and nostrils full of snow, 
half the mountain slamming downhill, uprooting 
trees, boulders, line-shacks, turning the night 
inside out, over and over again, 

Until it all settled in the dark she felt 
coming to a stop around her. She remembers the chapter 
on Fright and Self Control, and takes tiny helpings 
of air trapped in the space her mittens made. 

She has no idea which way is up. It is 
darker in there than in the childhood dream 
where something white was always at the window. 
Now, there is no window, only tons of snow 
packed hard against her, front and back, 
like king-sized mattresses piled high 
for the storybook princess and the pea. 

She must not pass out; she knows snow is porous 
enough to keep her alive, but can almost feel 
the ice mask forming across her face, the breath's 
own handiwork of shallow sleep. 

If she is to survive, she must now force saliva 
between her lips. If it heads for her chin, escape 
is above; if not, she may panic and die 
upside down by herself, 
the acceleration of nerves, the state of being 
scared to death. 

She lucks out. Up is up! 
She tries to come out of her bend, 
and feels the slightest give along the curve 
of her body. It could be an air space. There are 
such things -- some the size of root cellars: hard 
slabs of snow tumbled together like a house of cards. 

She turns and finds she can move her head; leaning, 
digging with her elbow, she drops off 
to the left, like falling out of bed. 

She stands on a slanting floor in the blackest dark 
she has ever been in. She begins 
feeling her way around her cell, and something 
flaps across her face. She grabs at it 
and holds on, hoping it is still intact. It 
is the avalanche cord, orange and long, that unfurled 
from its cannister on impact 
when she belly-flopped at the top of the mountain. 
She is hooked to it and has to believe the other end 
is where it belongs: waving merrily above her grave. 

They will find her soon, she is sure, headlamps flicking 
across the terrain; they will tug at her cord, 
signalling as they probe and dig. She continues along 
the wall, getting the contour of the place. 
There are alleyways everywhere, but they may be 
dead ends; besides, she wants her cord 
to have all the slack it needs. 

On the nearest block, she finds a tilted shelf 
of torn ice, beneath it: a frond of hemlock; she eases it 
out, hoping it is still attached, but it comes off 
in her hand. She sets it aside and becomes aware 
of the fragrance filling the room. 

She squats and closes her eyes, as if 
she were in the forest after a good downhill run, 
and thinks: Perhaps she can tunnel to a tree; 
perhaps there will be a door there, hinged 
by elves. "Grendel" she says aloud. "Mab, Lizard 
Leg, Horse-Nettle. " 

But she has missed the password; nothing opens 
anywhere. She laughs at herself and shakes her head. 
What to do. Her rucksack is gone, ripped off 
up top. She could use something to eat. 
She has pockets everywhere, zippers, buttons, snaps, 
but she comes up empty, 
except for car keys and a penlight 
dead on its chain. 

She knows there is air for a day or more, 
and remembers the boy in Norway buried for a week. 

  She wants to eat snow but doesn't want cramps. 
  She wants to dig but thinks of cave-ins. 
She needs to scream but no one will hear. 

It's high in her chest, something 
like the ache from running too hard too long 
before you run through it and out 
the other side. She lets it come on. 

It's as though she's been scolded and sent 
to her room. She takes off her mittens and goes 
to her knees to fill each with snow. "Bad girl" 
she says and hurls her mittens away, starting to sob 
only a little, mumbling frightened things. 

And then the right foot. She stands 
and stomps the snow, running her fingers up 
the avalanche cord, still safe in the air 
where it hangs. "Mustn't pull. Good girl. Mustn't 
pull." And she starts 
reeling it in, an inch at a time, allowing 
the orange ribbon to slip through the roof 
like a thread from her mother's hem, 
curling at her feet, the last of it fluttering 
across her face and down her arms. 

She sits and finds the end of the cord. She puts it 
to her thumb and starts rolling it up, 'round and 'round, 
neat as a pin it goes, a giant thimble growing 
in the dark. But she tires of her game and crawls away 
in a widening circle in search of the hemlock branch. 
She buries her face in it and strips a handful 
of needles, rubbing them between her palms, inhaling 
the sweet sticky smear she has made of herself. 

She plants the rest of the branch upright 
in the floor, and lies down to face it, patting 
the snow, telling it things, crossing 
and uncrossing her legs behind her. 

She saw him arrive in a jumble of fire, a wee 
bit of a thing on the lowest limb. He wore 
a green jerkin with hollow stone buttons and knickers 
puffed to the bands. She started to hum 
to see if he'd dance in his circle of light, 
and the jig that he did made her laugh in a giggle 
inside. She watched him kick at the base of the tree 
and bark fall away from the door. 

With his hat held aloft and a sweep of his arm, 
he bade her Good Day and Come In. It was in half light 
she climbed, hand over hand, the elf 
urging her on from behind; up, up 
to the uppermost rung 
to a four-legged chair and a window of sticks 
tied together with vines, and a view 
of the snowfield below. 

They were there, starting the scuffline by moonlight, 
wands marking the turn where the ski pole appeared. 
She is tired from climbing and wants to sleep; 
she will call to them later, after they find 
whatever it is they lost.
The woman behind the loan desk says No 
for the last time and waits for him to leave. 
He stands and makes sure his sleeve 
brushes against a stack of file folders, 
leaving a clutter of paper at her feet; 
he doesn't look back.

Out on the steps, he hears the guard 
locking the doors behind him. Three o'clock. 
He buttons the only button left on his coat 
and straightens the paperclip he took 
when her back was turned. He sticks it 
in his collar, feeding it 
through the flap on the other side, 
twisting it back on itself, 
against the wind, before heading north 
along the tracks. 

The rain has turned to sleet, and he looks 
for a stopping place. A tavern roof rises close 
to the roadbed, but he knows 
he's not welcome there. 

He takes the wad of deposit slips he stole 
from the glass bin and lets it fly, 
dozens of giant flakes 
coming back in his face, a few settling off 
to his left, dark down the sloping gravel 
where the stagnant water waits. 

He's soaking through but can almost see 
the tunnel beneath the interstate; if no one 
is there, he can get a few minutes rest. 
It's no place to stay too long; beatings 
are as common as dogs. 

He tries taking two ties at a time, 
but settles for a shorter stride, squinting 
his way to the underpass. 

The walls are wet from seepage, but he's safe 

from sleet. He squats on the foot-ledge 
and pulls his arms close to his chest, blowing 
into one fist and then the other, his cheeks 
puffed and blotched, his toes working themselves 
like fingers in wet mittens, the girders 
rumbling overhead under the weight 
of holiday traffic leaving the city. 
He's tempted to stay the night 

But hears them in time to make a run for it, 
three toughs heading home for supper, shouting 
him out, swearing to take his shoes 
the next time they catch him napping. 

He stops beyond the bend and sits down 
on the track, the same roadbed, the same 
water, blacker in the dusk. He hears 
the train downtrack, the engine light closing in. 

He decides to get out of the way in time 
to watch the commuters 
dry behind glass. He feels for the largest stone 
he can find, and holds it lightly, ready 
to shatter a window, but lets it fall 
down the ravine, the caboose trailing 
its red lantern, pitching him back into darkness. 

He sits on the rail trembling 
beneath him, the sleet becoming snow. He curls 
out his tongue, allowing flake 
after flake to land and dissolve; others stay 
whole on his eyelids, closed against the sky. 

He wishes he had gloves 
and a pair of buckle boots -- the ones 
he had when he was growing up, when 
his mother would turn them half inside out 
to warm over the register. 

He can feel the flannel lining, the gloves 
supple and light on his hands, 
the new smell of leather 
that means everything.
He obeys his holy orders 
and parks at the convent wall, 
taking the path on the public side 
of the fence. Once inside, 

He heads through the trees 
to the chapel doors, where he uses the key 
that weighs heavy in his pocket all week long. 

He enters the confessional and waits 
for them to come: novices 
half his age, lastingly wed 
to their vows they seem 
anxious to pass their mild offenses 
through his forgiving hands, and to do 
what he says they must. 

He admits to having thoughts, but keeps them 
under control; he enjoys 
their supplication, rehearses what it is 
he says to them, but wonders 
if they ever wish they knew 
the man behind the cloth. 

He receives them each in turn, 
the youngest always last, innocent 
to a fault. He hears her leave in prayer, 
the residue of her voice filtered 
by the screen, the clean breath, 
the slightest touch of starch adrift 
in the dark 
his fingers long to explore.
At seven thousand feet, the underpinnings of clouds 
look more like wind-ice on a mountain lake, 
its mist working among the curls, the sun 
slanting its shadows toward Canada, as his last 
day on Earth opens its wings. 

His leather envelope made it through the gate 
with him; he holds it flat to his chest 
as the 727 banks hard to the left, avoiding those 
who hurt him most; he leans back, aware 
of the headrest crinkling behind him; he wonders 
whether the night crew changed the paper 
or if he's deep in dandruff or Vitalis 
or the female breath of hair rinse 
ready to fill his nostrils if he turns; perhaps 
a long blonde hair has already settled 
in his own; he keeps his hands to himself & sees 
the No Smoking sign still aglow; he smiles, 
remembering his room 

On West Seneca, the essentials laid out on the bed 
last night: upholstery thread tight on its spool, 
the plastic spoon he licked clean yesterday 
afternoon, two baggies of black powder, the socks 
they are flying in, & the ampule of mercuric 
fulminate that will blow them apart, but now waits 

  cool in its cotton mesh, safe in a Parker pen 
  whose sac of blue ink lies unplugged & limp 
in a dresser drawer he will never open again. 

His hands are on his lap, a scar 
on one knuckle where a hacksaw jumped his grip 
in his father's shop; it fades when he stretches it; 
he makes it disappear again before tasting 
the moisture forming on his palms: almost warm 
enough to detonate the ampule riding in his vest; 
he tries to recall the doubting Thomas who left 
a hand in Bomb School, but comes up with only half 
a name; he folds his fingers into fists 
& is bemused, thinking of them gone astray. 

He will distribute them soon, the brochures, 
simple in design: xeroxed back-to-back after 
hours, folded once, black letters on yellow stock, 
elite type, precise language; they will read 
how he learned as a boy in a cellar 
that chemicals do what they say they do; 
they will see the formula & wish themselves down 
behind trees or hillside where they might 
burrow & climb for their lives. 

By paragraph twelve he'll be holding the pilots 
at bay, having them squat at the cockpit walls, 
trying to find more distance from the ampule 
they watch slide from its pen to be lashed 
to the curve of the spoon, thread holding it open 
& bare for the heat his fingers & thumb 
are frantic to give. 

He wonders if some hero will make his move 

  & fail; the priest will mention Hellfire, a parent 
  her child, a son his mother dying in Sunnyside; 
some will say nothing at all as they read 
how the spoon will be laced to the baggies & stuffed 
overhead in the console 
to melt all controls to their pinnings 
when the ampule goes wild at his touch. 

The cabin sign is off; 
a stewardess is hustling drinks in First Class; 
he unbuckles himself & stands, 
adjusting the black powder socks that dangle 
from his belt; he unzips the envelope & removes 
the brochures; the stern man across the aisle 
accepts one & flicks on the overhead light; 
it is 8:13; they are due at La Guardia at nine.
The late June sun had come in the window 
over his mother's bed, and he used it 
to make shadows on the wall, but they came out 
looking like ropes, tight twisted things, 
wrapped around themselves. He flicked 
all ten fingers and closed them 
into fists, pressing knuckles to knuckles 
until they hurt, as they did 
when he'd fight in the schoolyard. 

They were big hands, like Grandfather Fitz's 
he'd been told, the man long dead, whose sepia eyes 
never closed as they stared him down 

  from the opposite corner, the oval portrait 
  leaning too close on its wire. 

He knew he shouldn't look below the frame 
at his sleeping mother, but he did, 
sometimes, and saw things. He did not 
enjoy seeing her nightgown hiked up 
to her hips when the sheet slipped away 
in the night. He wished he could yank it 
down, tuck it in, pin it tight 
to the binding running around the mattress. 

What he liked best was lying at first light, 
her long braid brown and inviting, 
almost touching the floor. But he grew 
afraid when once she half-roused 
and turned, a shoulder strap slack enough 
to reveal a breast, the only one 
he'd ever seen. He tried to remember 
nursing at it, wondering if he'd fondled 
the braid as he fed, if she caressed 
him in his nakedness. 


  But then he'd shut his eyes and turn
  to the wall, getting his face 
as close to it as he could, his left hand 
strained and flat against the cool blue plaster. 
Often, near morning, she would say things 
in dream, and he would cover his ears and hum 
until he heard nothing at all. 

And now, on this the last day 
he'd ever have to spend in grammar school, 
he lay awake in the room he'd always shared 
with her, and thought about 

His father far down the hall 
in his chamber, his bothersome snoring 
muffled from Mother's delicate sleep; 
his sister close on the other side 
of the wall, in the room he wanted 
for himself. He shut off the alarm 

Before it clanged and was relieved to find 
his mother wrapped, tangled, 
only a big toe jutting out for air 
in the narrow space between them. 

Downstairs, he smeared a piece of bread 
with apple butter and sat on the porch, 
remembering the summer morning his sister 
forced him to stay on the bottom step 
while she repeated the lie of a woman 
in a long black car who would soon be at the curb; 
she would wear a black dress and gloves 
and laced boots. She would take him away. 
He licked the last of the apple butter 
from his thumb and went off the back way, 
over the fence and down the path; 
he was late and stopped to get 
a scolding note from Sister Helena. 

When the last of all bells rang for the day, 
he opened his locker and stuck 
his copy of Ring magazine in his back pocket 
and took the leftover bottle 
of ink to smash against the brick wall 
rising high over the rectory window, someone 
yelling, promising there'd be hell to pay, 
calling him by name but in a voice that knew 
it was best to leave him alone. 

At the end of the block, 
he settled under a tree, the largest maple 
on the Town Hall lawn; he thought 
of it as his own and came to it 
on such days. He pulled 
his magazine out and uncurled it, Billy Conn 
on the cover, his cut-man taking the stool 
out of the corner, the ropes tight behind him, 
thick and twisted, wrapped in tape. 

The idea hit him like a quick jab: 
he could have a ring! The hardware store 
had clothesline. He slipped one inside his jacket 
and paid for the other two. And then home. 

No one was there, and he went to the cellar. 
He undid the clotheslines and looped 
the three ends around the first steel pole 
that supported the main beams of the house. 

And then the braiding: crossing the strands, 
as he'd seen his mother do a thousand times 
at her vanity, stopping
to straighten the snarls, to tighten
the loops; inch by inch it grew 
from pole to pole: the top rope 
of his own ring, his own place, 
the rope burns on his hands 
reminding him of the shadows on their wall 
this morning, Grandfather's eyes, 
his mother's long plaited hair 
half undone by sleep.

He wouldn't use tape; he wanted the strands 
as they were. The last knot tied, he slapped 
the rope and it almost sang back. 
He went to a neutral corner and saw Billy Conn 
coming at him. He circled to his left 
and kept away till the round was over. 

He stepped out of the ring and did 
some shadowboxing near the washtubs, 
banging away at the air, talking himself 
into a frenzy, taking a few shots to the head, 
the gut, moving away, jabbing, sticking, 
until he was soaking wet. 

The faucet squeaked when he turned it 
on full force, cold water drowning out 
everything, hands splashing it everywhere, 
his shirt and slacks and undershorts 

  peeled off, a bath towel stiff but dry 
  hanging from its nail near the stairs. 

Barefoot and naked, 
he stepped back under the rope 
to dry off in the ring, wrapping the towel 
tight at the waist, tucking it in, 
arms held overhead in victory. 

And then the army cot, folded 
within reach, to be snapped open 
and snugged up against the pole 
closest to the furnace, two full floors 
beneath Mother's bed. 

He stretched out on the taut canvas, 
his left arm across his face, 
the right finding the braided rope, 
curling his fingers around it, 
tightening his grip, running it slowly 
out and back as far as he could, his mouth 
going dry as he felt the strands rise 
and disappear in the palm of his hand.
His visits home are risings from the dead: 
the walk down Woodward from the depot, 
Kittie waiting at the doorstep, smoothing 
the clean white apron she starched 
and ironed an hour ago. 

There's always the unwinding, the hiding away 
of the suitcase as though he were going 
to stay, the toothbrush back in its circle 
at the sink, the hairbrush upside down 
on the shelf, the drapes thrown open 
in the far bedroom, closed off when he's gone. 

No matter the season, Fitz goes by himself 
alongside the barn to the stream he compares 
to a mile of track west of Galeton, the same 
dips and turns. He prefers the stream, 

But his crew's not there clearing the way 
for the 9:53 from Buffalo, waving it on 
before heading out to fix whatever 
it rattled loose 
between milepost #599 and #607. 

There'll be joints in need of shims, 
a dozen or more spikes riding up, a tie 
edging away from its stones; everything 
scrawled on a pad 
they hand him at quitting time. 

The stream is almost quiet. The rime 
that flared the willow is gone, the beards 
of ice thinning along the crags, one more winter 
giving up to thaw; it's good 

To be away from the gangshack awhile. 
He spends too much time in it 
staring through window dust, thinking
of his men, downtrack, taking a break, 
their tin cups in the canvas sack 
lashed to the handcar, the gallon of coffee 
tied thick with newspapers. He'd be with them 
if he could, but there's no going back 
from foreman to gandy. 

Sunday night he'll be back at The Inn 

  sharing another meal with boarders 
  he'd rather see passing on a train, 
and then the hours alone 
thinking letters he will never write: 

To Lyle at dental school to ease up 
on his work. To Kell at U.B. to lay off 
the parties. And Kathleen 
spending the last year of high school 
in an empty house with her mother. 

A small shelf of ice gives way 
at his feet. He watches it turn in place 
and head downstream. 

The night has come cold. He looks back 
toward the house and imagines Kittie 
calling him to bed, the patch of ice 
lost in the current some thirty ties away.
Linen napkins, spotless from the wash, starched 
and ironed, smelling like altar cloths. Olives 
and radishes wet in cut glass, a steaming gravy bowl 
attached to its platter, an iridescent pitcher cold 
with milk, the cream stirred in moments before. 

The serving fork, black bone at the handle, capped 
in steel, tines sharp as hatpins. Stuffed celery, 
cut in bite-sized bits, tomato juice flecked 

  with pepper, the vinegar cruet full to the stopper 
  catching light from the chandelier. 

Once-a-week corduroyed plates with yellow trim, 
a huge mound of potatoes mashed and swirled. 
Buttered corn, side salads topped with sliced tomatoes, 
a tall stack of bread, a quarter pound of butter 
warmed by its side. And chicken, falling off the bone: 
crisp skin baked sweet with ten-minute bastings. 

Homemade pies, chocolate mints and puddings, 
coffee and graceful glasses of water, chipped ice 
clinking the rims. 

Cashews in a silver scoop, the centerpiece a milkglass 
compote with caved-in sides, laced and hung 
with grapes, apples, and oranges for the taking.
doesn't complain anymore 
about her husband's late nights or drinking 
or, most especially, the way he left 
his pajamas on the bathroom floor 
when he'd come downstairs, freshly shaved 
and showered, ready for his day 
at the office where he died. 

She used to wave goodbye through the oval 
front door, and trudge upstairs 
to see if he'd remembered. She'd pick them up, 
wishing he were still in them, shaking 
them out, scolding him 
in a voice no more than a whisper. 

She'd fold them and tuck them 
under his pillow in the big double bed 
they'd shared for thirty years in the room 
over the parlor and its piano. 

She'd buy new ones once a year, 
grumbling about him 
right there in the men's department, 
deciding on a style that seemed young, never 
grey, usually without buttons, and always 
summer-weight and tall. 

The pair she bought last Thursday had blue 
stripes. She had them gift-wrapped 
in the store's silver foil and took them 
home where she left them 
on the edge of the bed he'd slept in 
for the last time a month ago. 

After the local news and weather, 
she locked the cellar door and left 
the pantry bulb ablaze, 
to keep the shadows in their place, 
and went upstairs. 

The bedside lamp shed light 
on the box, waiting in its trim. 
She opened it and took the pajamas 
to her lap: the noisy sheet of tissue lost 
within the folds; sixteen more pins 
to add to the scrap of flannel she kept 
tacked above the sewing machine. 

She was pleased to find the inspection slips. 
Number four had checked the bottoms; number 
twelve had seen to the tops. 

He would have liked them. No buttons, bordered 
cuffs, four snaps on the fly, and enough room 
in the seat to turn over 
and over in his sleep. 

His pillow was where it belonged. 
She laid the pajamas full length along his side 
of the bed, the left leg bent at the knee, 
where she could feel it on her back, if he were there. 

Come morning, she will drop them 
on the bathroom floor on her way downstairs. 

The neighbor children won't notice her 
waving from the door, but when the school bus leaves, 
she will close the curtains and go back 
upstairs to find 
what she knows she will find, and take them 
in her arms.
The bottom sweater button 
is in the next to bottom hole, 
and his mother's fingers almost 
find it out, but climb instead 
to the polished head of a brooch: 
a maiden blushing to the left, hair 
falling across a shoulder 
bared in sunlight. 

Something about the eyes tells her 
she should know him, perhaps 
the young man who brings her groceries 
or Father Sullivan 
dressed for a day off. 

But no. The voice is more comfortable 
than that; it fits the neighborhood. 
His hair is going grey; tanned, 
he must spend time along the lake. 
The eyes react 

  as her father's would: cut glass 
  catching light 

Shed by a flowered bulb in the ceiling 
where they stand stopped 
in the upstairs hall, she 
at her bedroom door; her married son 
nearer the guest room, a step away, 
dressed from the shower 
hardly used since he lived at home. 

She'd like to have a towel 
from the linen closet, one of the long 
fluffy ones they used to save for company, 
and wrap it 'round his head, the way 
his mother must have done 
before he grew so tall. 

He seems familiar, 

  but she can't believe the name 
  he used for her. 

She takes his arm 
and turns his face up 
toward the light, as mothers do, 
and finally asks the question: 
Whose boy are you?
She wakens, to an attic room 
whose curtains have gone limp with rain. 
The rosary beads that helped her turn 
to sleep still lie half-said 
across her flannel gown. 

If she could lift her head 
enough to see beyond the sill, she'd know, 
she thinks, what place she's in. 
Which means, perhaps, she's not at home, 
for if she is where is the sash 
she pulls on when she needs to sit 
for meals or evening prayers? 

And what about the ceiling? 
Those squares are nothing like they are 
at home. Although she can't recall 
quite what they ought to be, she knows 
these aren't the same. Why, what if 
they begin to fall? What if 
she counts them, row by row, and has 
an extra number when she's through? 
Why would anyone paste a ceiling up 
like that? Where are the nails? 

It must be winter still. She'll ask 
for another blanket when they bring her 
toast and tea. Up on an elbow, 
her woolen robe just out of reach, she sees 
the maple start its contradiction: 
its closest branch full-leaf and bowing 
against the window screen. 

Back deep in her pillow, she decides 
to close her eyes to see if she can figure 
out how long and who and when and where, 
but drifts away instead to watch the specks 
dart beneath her lids. She moves her eyes 
from side to side and finds a summer sky, 
and sleeps beneath it. 
She doesn't hear her lunch arrive, but is shaken 
awake to drink her medication and to be cranked  
uptight for the tray; she bibs her napkin
and takes a spoon to her tea in near silence. 

She's hoped for purple finches and gets them, 
two by two at the window ledge, poking 
around in the spillage of thistle and millet, 
cracked corn and shucks of sunflower seeds. 

Then up to the feeder they go, held somehow 
to the glass, and she watches them holding on 
in midair, the others waiting in hemlocks 
on the far side of the wall. 

One finch looks in on her, 
tilts its dull raspberry head and is gone, 
its mate intent on the meal, a bold 
pale eyebrow underscoring the crown. 

She would like to see their nest: 
a scoop of grass and twigs, usually lined 
with hair, often her own, back when 
she'd yank the barn rope, rocking the rain barrel 
on its swivel, drenching herself 
in the afternoon sun, toweling and combing, 
brushing and drying 
on the wide flat lawn. 

There were hemlocks then, and willows 
along the brook, where the birds fed themselves, 
as they are doing now, newcomers, 
only an arm's length from her bed, 
where she strains in a harness of cloth 
to see them landing on the sill. 
He'd find them among fallen limbs and brush 
in the pitiful stretch of trees 
they call their woods: stones the size 
of grapefruits, lugged out to the driveway 
to be washed off with the garden hose 
and left to bake on the blacktop 
in the high sun before being tucked away 
in the trunk of the car, along the sides, 
some down in the well, snug against the spare 
held fast by the stretch-strap doubling 
as the tire-iron brace, a four-pronged plus sign 
looking more like a silver cross the way 
it is propped, as though its Christ had fallen 
off, perhaps still there laid out 
among the stones. 

Headed for Buffalo, the outskirts, 
the homestead where there were no rocks 
to line the rose garden, houses no more 
than a car's width away from the next, 
the narrow concrete tilting 
toward Bannigan's front porch. 

And his parents would be there, pacing 
the sunporch, waiting for the visit to begin: 
five days of clutter and talk, sleeping bags 
and diapers, suitcases, books, 
hanging clothes, shopping bags; space enough 
in the guest room. 

And then the stones, last, always 
last: a few at a time; each placed 
ceremoniously along the rim of the rose garden 
that curled against the side of the garage 
to the back picket fence, turning left 
at the Broderson's shed and back 
toward the house. 

Father is dead; Mother is gone, and soon 
strangers will be moving in. But the stones 
are still there, years of stones. Last night 
he went off alone to do something about that. 
He took only the three-inch paintbrush saved 
from his father's workbench, one 
of a dozen washed after every use, never 
to be thrown away, clean in its plastic pouch, 
the snap still intact. 

Seven hours by train, a short walk 
to the Delaware bus, twenty minutes to the city 
line. He gets off a stop early and crosses 
the street to the hardware store; the name 
has changed, common as a tenpenny nail. 

He chooses a gallon of black enamel 
and feels the plank floor shudder 
beneath him as the vibrator-stand 
shakes the can to a blur on the counter. 

        His mother's hands are shaking in her room, some 
        400 miles downstate; if she had lids on the cups 
        she would spill less tea on her sweaters and robe. 
        He may suggest it to the home. 

        Now, at 10:30 in the morning, she is saying 
        her first rosary of the day, the floor nurse leading 

          her on, bead by bead, as the 
  paint slaps against its lid 
          only a block away from the altar rail 
        where she knelt for half a lifetime. 

        She doesn't know 
        what she is doing; she is seventeen again: 
        Springville, her brothers bringing her candies, Papa 
        home on weekends from the railroad gang, 
        her mother, rosary in hand at bedtime, and Kathleen 
        sleeping with her own beads under her pillow, 
        the same rosary she holds in her grape-veined hands 
        this morning, a day's journey from where he stands 
        waiting for his twenty-dollar bill to be broken. 

        She is alone for the first time in weeks: 
        the nurse has left to check on a noise in the hall, 
        and Mother goes on inventing melodies and words 
        to replace the orthodox prayers once her own. 
        In her wheelchair, the canvas waistband tight 
        as a saint's hairshirt, she feels 
        the beads loose in her hand. She fingers them, 
        their roundness, small as pebbles, smaller 
        than the stones her son has gone to see again. 

        She is drawn to the beads, sensing nourishment. 
        Her lips are moving in prayers 
        never heard before; her tongue is extended, her eyes 

          closed. She bends closer to 
  the beads, accepting 
          them now like the host safe in her mouth, sliding 
        slowly as forgiveness on the same saliva 
        the aides dab away with tissues. 

        But now, it serves her well: for the beads 

          have slipped fully beyond the 
  lips; they could 
          be green peas all in a row tumbling from a spoon, 
        beginning their descent. No pain. No outcry; 
        she is deep in a tangled meditation; only 
        the crucifix is left dangling against her chin, 
        its small silver link holding fast to the first 
        of its fifty-nine beads. 

        Christ is in His diaper and the thorns are intact; 
        He is swaying slightly swaying, His features 
        rubbed away by Mother's mothering. They retrieve 
        the rosary and dry it well enough 
        for her to go on to the next decade, the connected beads 
        back where they belong: in the tiny palm 
        that waited like a cradle or a font 
        or a crypt dark behind a large washed stone.

The paint can is freed from its shaking. He takes 
the gallon as it is, swinging on its wire handle, 
and drops the change in his side pocket. 

The town seems almost the same: the village hall, 
the playground at the corner, Kay's Drugstore 
bought out and revamped from counter 
to name. The sun is hot as he turns down Lincoln 
Boulevard. The house is vacant; he decides 
not to use the spare key for any last look. 

The backyard is his grotto and he goes to it. 
The stones are still in their looped line 
skirting the edge of the rose garden. He stands 
frozen in place. He wants all of the stones; 
he wants to take them back to the ground he walks 
every evening, the frail run of trees 
that flanks his house. 

He feels for his rosary and finds it 
in his suitcoat pocket, kept there for good luck. 
He takes out the beads on barstools sometimes, 
to fondle them in the dim light, saying 
their prayers half in a trance, and in churches 
he needs to find when he is alone on the road, 
cities he doesn't want to see ever again. 

The stones must stay. And so he begins: 
within minutes they are laid out 
in a wide circle. Some of them tipping, a few 
already out of ranks, but each assigned a plot 
of ground: the paternosters, the aves, 
the tenth aves each doubling as a Gloria Patri. 

The shrubbery encircling the yard is thick 
enough to hide him from the neighbors. He stands 
at the back of the lawn, at the strand of beadstones 
which must stray from the others so that he 
might affix the crucifix-stone to its tip. 
He knew back home which stone it must be: 
the one with the purple vein running around 
its middle, and it is there. 

He loosens the lid of the gallon 
with the half dollar he brought from his dresser 
drawer, the chifforobe which once stood 
in his father's room and now holds his own socks 
and shirts and bonds and bills. The paint 
is rich, the brush still soft; he can smell 
the turpentine on the bristles, dry and stained 
deep with many colors far down in the base, 
each a different Saturday morning project done 
with his father on this property, before the stones, 
before almost anything. 

He kneels at the first stone and grabs too quickly, 
anxious to see the purple run of color, and jams 
his thumb, blood forming already beneath the nail. 
He replaces the stone and paints a rough cross 
on it, trying to leave the vein purple 
as a cinch for the stipe. He takes a giant step 
to where the next stone lies: the paint 
goes on with hardly a trace of dirt; another 
step and he is past The Lord's Prayer, onto the first 

  trio of aves: the Hail Marys, one like the next. 
  The black is as lush as the counterman 
said it would be. 

Another single bead, and he finds himself 
praying aloud, loud enough only for a stone 
to hear. Another space and then on to the flat slab 
of sandstone he knew he would use 
to connect the circle of decades. He gives it 
two brush strokes, unbroken, 
a child's attempt at the ancient fish, good enough 
for anyone who knows. 

Three spaces beyond the fish lies a speckled stone; 
it goes black, flush to the grass. Nine more 
go quickly, slopping the paint in a blob 
on top, all at once, scampering back 
and forth to smooth out the drippage, ripping away 
the blades of grass 
that are stained, stuffing them in his back pockets. 
He says the prayers as he paints his way 
through the next ten; one has a bit of moss 
from the shaded area along the spilloff spout 
on the garage roof, the others bare 
as the edge of grave markers. 

It takes three Hail Marys to paint 
a hail mary, the phrase "blessed art thou among women" 
the line that slows him down: he finds himself 
repeating it, remembering the pitchers 
of lemonade Mother would leave in the shade 
with chipped ice and a tall glass when he 
would use the handmower on a hot day. 

He is rubbing the grass now, the way 
he did when he was a boy, after cutting it twice, 
once fence to drive and, again, from garden 
to house. He would sit and sip from the sweating glass; 
the grass, the smell, the silent creatures 
he'd disturbed, all 

  holier and cleaner than the wood trimming 
  the stations of the cross in the church a block away 
over the back fence. He runs his hand 
across the grass until it hits his leg 
and wakes him to his task. 

Decade two. The stones are dusty and pitted. 
It all takes too long and he wonders 
if the weather will hold. He crawls on 
to The Lord's Prayer, three spaces away; he smiles 
as he comes to the words, "Those who trespass," 
and looks over his shoulder toward a space 
in the hedge, but knows that 
what he is doing is his to do. 

The third and fourth are almost too much. 
The paint needs stirring, the brush is filled 
with dirt; his time is running out. If 
he were to show anyone a decade, it would not be 
either of these. The paint is too thick, the grass 
too black, the stone-face showing through too often. 

He must finish and get away; he feels it 
in his wrists and ankles. He wonders if he should 
have come at all. His thumb, 
with its nail blood dried black, is numbing. 
He needs to be home, close to his own 
ring of stones at the far end of the property 
where he can sit and poke at the mild fires 
he builds there, feeding the flames 
with twigs and branches fallen on their own, 
the rocks large enough not to split from the heat, 
high enough to contain the blaze. 

But it is time for his best work. 
The paint goes on like cream, as thick 
as the cream that came 
in the bulb-topped bottles of the forties 
that the milkman would leave in the back hall 
during the war if they'd remember to prop 
the shirtcard cow in the window alongside 
the sign for the iceman and breadman, 

Smooth as the blade of grass he holds still 
between his lips, thin and slick, not a blade 
to crush between thumbs 
to make an unseemly noise, not one that would grow 
in a back lot, but one like all the others 
in this yard, planted by Father, tended 
by Father, watered by Father at dusk while other lawns 
went to seed and crabgrass and weed no one 
could name. It tastes good and clean and cool. 

And now it is done. The last beadrock black 
as the pieces of coal he was allowed to pitch 
into the yawning furnace, 
when Father would bank the fire, 
at nine-thirty every night, so that they could awaken 
in Lake Erie winters to heat rising from the floor grids. 

He looks back at the house, up 
at the window where the afternoon light 
is spreading its daily shadow across the corner 
of the small blue room he'd shared with his mother. 

He goes to his knees and puts the lid back 
on the empty can. He wipes the brush across the label, 
the brand name, the directions, the cautions, 
cleaning the bristles as best he can. He will 
finish the job as his father would have him do, 
but not here; back home, at his own bench 
in his own garage, where he belongs. 

He slips the brush into its plastic sleeve 
and drops it carefully into his inside suitcoat 
pocket and walks to the corner of the house 
where the same garbage cans wait hidden 
behind the spruce trees. He lowers the container 
far down inside the first and heads for the street; 
he does not look back. 

He has his wallet, his ticket home, 
his father's brush. He is listening to the angelus 
tolling from the parish belfry: six o'clock. 
But there is something else, quieter than the bells 
calling the villagers to prayer, something 
closer. It is his mother's voice, restored, 
the same voice that used to call to him 
from the kitchen window; she is obeying the ringing 
of the bells; she is intoning the beads 
he has left in her name beneath the Niagara sky: 
the threat of rain diminished, a healing breeze 
from the distant river 
drying the rocks where they lie.

No act so elemental: to climb 
in silence, watching the cloudy distance 
gather the waters into an accumulation 
like thunder. Sky flowers 
at this altitude of summer, while below, 
at the base of the tower, Jeffrey, 
age three, knows very well how 
at the center of things he is (but 
he can't see this arc of lakes and mountains). 

Were this another kind of tower 
the sparks which pass between son 
and father could set the blackest sheets 
of fire cutting toward the hills. 
Such a device burns prints of the shadows 
cast by its own light in granite 
and concrete, marks skin with a red 
tracery of flowers where dark 
kimono dyes transmit the heat. 

When I was a kid, each time we 
crossed the Whitestone Bridge and saw 
Manhattan's towers, I knew the fear 
of the bomb. Few in Hiroshima 
remembered any noise. At Asona Park 
that night, explosions from fuel tanks, 
mirrored in the dark bay like fountains, 
excited the grieving children, cheered them: 
this, the fatal saving grace -- 

to perceive amid wreckage the momentarily 
beautiful. No one cried out 
though wounds and burns were general. 
One old man, haunted by whiteness, 
an egg-like fluid melting down 
his cheeks, asks politely for water. 
A month later, radiation sickness 
taints their blood, while 
in the ashes wild flowers bloom.
Winter keeps us inside. My wife 
tells me she is terrified 
of death: how everything vanishes 
and nothing you do can change this. 
Then today, warm weather. In a 
friend's four-seater, we fly 
north to Rampart, a village 
on the Yukon, a ghostly airstrip, cabins, 

dark chips against the snow; 
banking, heading south along the 
pipeline, I ask for the controls 
and find my fear of the ground 
taking us higher, up 
to cloud-level, where, in luminous mist 
I yield, easing us back toward 
rolling ridges of spruce, thousands 
of black-barbed brush-strokes on white paper. 

Suddenly Jeffrey leaps from his seat: 
"Hey ... Hey!" -- knowing first flight. 
At home again I say the shape a 
life can take can make the end 
less terrible. She says the 
thought of dying brings a shock 
to her body so bad she can't 
sustain it, if you could hold 

it steady in your mind you'd go mad.
Sickened by the recent loss of his son 
strafed to death on a train, 
he'd traveled west from Vienna. 
Mittersill, Austria under U.S. occupation, 
and Webern, just past sixty, 
a small man with a precise 
concern for order, thoughtful, 
religious, minutely alone: beyond 

the determinate chaos of his age 
-- dazed armies dragging themselves 
away from defeat -- he struggled to 
slow things down by making them 
happen quickly and be over, 
as if the violence he'd never 
witnessed pressed upon some black 
future no one could long for. 

At the home of his brother-in-law, 
a man he did not know well, 
likely a Nazi, whom two GI's 
that night had come to arrest, the composer 
stepped outside to smoke and walk about the yard. 
And as they marched Herr Martel out the door, 
a scuffle on the steps, one jittery kid 
bumps into Webern, shoots him through the chest. 

Like the retrograde motion of a film -- 
steel bouncing around his lungs, a fuming 
cloud sucked backward into a beaker -- an 
infant numbness spreads about the will. 
To age slowly in the perfecting of your skills 
takes the kind of luck I'd wish for you, friend- 
reader, if you'll pray for me. Ten years later 
the kid who'd shot him drank himself to death. 

Tied to the self a man can never shed 
such terrors, but listen: along a shady path 
which winds about this formal garden, 
bushes tamed, flowers beautifully affixed 
to rich dark soil, where even the pebbles 
we walk on, fragile chips of comfort, whisper 
his colors -- in this muted hollow our harshest step 
evokes the dissonant flush of cinnamon from the earth.
Together we stare at the map, 
a land so vast whole herds can 
vanish; each lake a lung. Angry, 
he is my father and my other 

self: his face comes forward 
with its three days' stubble. 
By night, the differences are harsh 
layers of cloth between us. We 

sit in the darkened cabin, pass 
a jug, and put the stain of 
wine upon our lips. Thirty years 
a wife and son are missing: 

how fragile my disinterest 
in such matters. Caribou -- come 
dissonant reports from 
far-off valleys. Cartridges and 

thunder. We men without holdings 
have to follow over the blue -- 
and orange-flowered tundra, crossing 
borders, urgent into what future? 

At dawn on a farther ridge they 
reappear in thousands like a mist 
whose eyes sprout crystal 
lichen, small buds and blooms of whiteness. 

That night I dream: between his ribs, 
translucent like stretched rawhide, 
the heart too is a map. A scar-line 
like barbed wire rides across 

one nipple. He stands beside 
his tethered dogs. The herd's dry 
bones excite a fine white 
ash above his moss-packed roof.
The boy on the beach, maybe 
ten, watches the waves come in. 

He was there before us, we've 
been here an hour, and it makes me 
remember Kansas. There's not much to do in 
Kansas, so you learn to be patient, 

to sit there and look at the sky 
till it answers back with your name. 

Then the day takes you into its 
vast impersonal mill. The wind 
blows over you and the fields 
listen, until life fills you up. 

What you glean at that age 
has no name, but it stays. 

So, today, in Mexico, I can sit and watch the 
boy watching the waves, the changing 
light, and nothing is happening -- a tern, 
a lolloping gull-and out there beyond 
the sky, the spider spinning and spinning 

the life which is here inside, 
and you just have to wait for it!
A tiny black square on the map 
with greenhouse tomatoes growing 
among the weeds, and children's 
drawings tacked to every wall. 
My friend and I sacked 
out and held each other close 
in the partial dark. 

Dozing, I remembered that for years 
there'd hung above my bed 
a delicate brown wash in sun 
and shade: Bacchus and Pan, a small 
girl's dream of summer. Bouncing 
and bouncing till the springs 
complained, I played among them 
rising and falling, my gusty self 
awash in wind and rain. 

Ghosts, and the promise of a sea 
long since departed, relics 
in the mirror as I speed away. 

And then I slept and dreamt the world 
had come and gone, 
and came to where Pan's candied 
pipes were playing. There, 
a little girl in pigtails, rising, 
falling under his sweet spell 
until she tumbled in a heap, 
dropping on soft pillows into sleep. 

How do I know the abandoned house 
is me, the breeze within the dream 
carrying ash, the clash of a screen 
door shutting? Spooked out of 
the settling cabin, I remember running 
back to the river, back to our canoe, 
a vacant swing still swinging, 
loose voices singing in the storm.
Now that we're here I can't 
believe I wanted to come: his 
stone-covered ground at the 
Christ-windowed church by the trunk- 
rooted tree near the sister pools 
on this rainforest coast of 
Maui -- Christmas '78 -- 
our thirteenth anniversary. 

Superstitious? ... No angel hovers 
near the spot, just a white 
horse in the next field Jeffrey 
wants to ride -- no way -- and his 
disappointment seals our day. 
Quickly we pack back into the car, 
Messiah fading from the radio, 
tourists in this life and the next: 

What do I know? I know 
a child of his was stolen once 
and once he mapped the whole of 
Yucatan by air. Well ... I've 
been there. Whatever we hold 
of the past is passing. Mist 
and rain, and beyond the 
crumbling sugar mill's remains 

the still volcano rising.
The light six inches up 
hovered like an aura. 

Rising before dawn, you 
pinned a five-foot serpent 

with a shovel, I 
chopped its head off. 

Dead skin and rattles salvaged, 
the meat we fried in butter. 

We said, "It tastes like chicken." 
Some stories never end. 

Last night a plastic replica 
unfolded into life in a dresser drawer. 

I felt its muscular 
fanged pressure bearing down. 

Now, bolder and more primitive, 
I'm coming back to what I once believed: 

this whole vast world extending 
through space is nothing, 

just a bubble on a stream, wash 
after wash of matter dissipating. 

Lifting the poisonous visage on my 
shovel, I fling it off among cacti: 

loop over loop a headless 
body writhing in the dirt.
Stuck on a sandstone ledge 
where -- god knows -- I should never 
have been, I remember starting 
to slip. For three days lost 
to my body, I sank toward the 
bottom of a pool where gray shapes 
splashed around me near the center 
of a fierce design. Deeper down 
the pool became a room: 

did the mind exude that eerie 
soft blue flame by which 
the walls could be read, 
here a bone, a shell, there 
an odd repeating element 
like the sun. Meanwhile my body 
lay -- skull cracked, face crusted, 
front teeth gone, male nurses 
adjusting the needles taped 

to my veins -- unconscious, away 
where Christ's bloody effigy sagged 
on St. Joseph's wall. And as the last 
light started to vacate that hole 
I met another self, there at the 
center: he drifted under my skin, 
breathed through my lungs and dreamed 
himself into my wounds. Like brother 
assassins, meeting and parting, 

we float in this vacuum forever.
The Cessna that flew me in 
skimming the coast 
banked around those 
rocky points of land and 
moved in close 
where a dead one was 
its flesh thrown up 
by the sea. We'd 
hoped for tusks 
but this bulk without a head 
a white suffused with brown 
too much to move, too dead 
to eat -- what's to be 
done with it? 
                   Like a compact 
car, you can't tell 
front from back. Seagulls 
probe for entry 
into its rotting entrails 
and I am appalled by the smell.
At Wales, to the west of the weather 
the islands crowd toward tomorrow. 
My Eskimo host, the 
postmaster, sports a digital 
watch and smokes as he talks: 
"I collect records. You 
pick up the phone, call 
Anchorage and have the 
albums you want within six days." 
At the tarpaper shack 
where he works an arrow on the wall 
pointing west says, "Russia 
30 Miles." He wears a 
wispy beard, a black moustache, 
black shoulder-length hair like me: 
Wales, Alaska-99783.
Seal for dinner, and after 
when cranes in a lopsided "V" 
honk over, someone 
runs outside and takes a shot.
Eight calendars on the walls, no 
plumbing. The bathtub stocked 
with laundry, Pampers, a rusted 
two-gallon can, towels, rags, Friskies, 
and that fancy oval makeup box: 
"Cardin." Here you sit 
on the plastic "Honey-pot" above 
a disposable plastic bag; but 
there are amenities: two stoves 
in the kitchen, radio, 
CB. For reading, National 
Geographic, Ski-Mobile, Newsweek, 
or the current catalog from Sears. 
Outside, the kids play soccer, 
basketball, climb on the 
roofs. Inside, the Eagles gloat 
"The Greeks Don't Want No 
Freaks" on the hi-fi.
Walrus, whale, and seal 
vertebrae and ribs -- bones of all 
sizes going back 
to the sand. 130 people 
on a spit of land 
in an arctic sea: how 
elemental it must 
be when winter closes in. 
But August's dull, a rainy 
fall. Come January: dogsleds, 
skiing, skating, snow- 
machines. Chop a hole 
in the ice and drop 
a line. Vent 
a snow-tunnel out to the street. 
No fragile enterprise 
under cold, shifting skies: snow 
is the Eskimo's element.
In the next town, Shish- 
maref, some sixty miles off 
you hear they bought a truck, paid 
double the purchase price 
to ship it in. Then 
just last week the son 
of the village mayor 
who didn't know about gears crashed 
into the town hall -- bad luck. 
This winter flying up 
to Shish from Nome, Walter's 
cousin went down in the hills: half 
a dozen people killed, never 
found her body or her 
baby's. There's a lady 
in that town, dug in the 
mound behind the village, found 
carved fossil ivory 
worth fifty thousand bucks.
I find my moods are 
jagged as the rocks. Today I climb 
through tundra to the ridge 
two hours toward the sun. A blessing 
on you snowbirds, arctic hare. There 
on a farther ridge -- radar -- 
a disc of silver rivaling the 
sun, staring at its double 
like a loaded gun across the strait. 
On a boulder I sit and muse. 
Away to the north a lagoon 
lies flat and gray. Those 
water-borne cliffs to the west: 
Siberia. Awed by this place 
the top of my head comes loose 
and tears assault my eyes. Hairy 
with impending ice-ages 
I see the past arriving at 
our shore: mammoths, mastodons, 
and man. All 
times are crowded into this 
small village, its 
magic, my privilege.
I stand by a tractor 
hitched to a flat-bed 
truck. On it a boat 
and in the boat brown 
plastic bags full of gear. 
Four people sit on the bags, 
two wearing holstered guns 
and one of them is White: 
someone who stayed. A large tan 
dog is hoisted up 
shivering with excitement 
at his luck 
as they drive off to camp.
I can name it: behind 
the Weyapuks' house, discarded 
among sand-grass, a large 
whale vertebra from that 
bowhead they got last spring. 
It must be 
twenty inches across the beam, 
a rich and creamy brown and 
nobody seems to claim it.
Next day, wind and mist. 
I lug my suitcase, sleeping 
bag, my whale bone 
to the air-strip. I seem 
to need another hand 
for this. Alone in the sheet-metal 
hangar I stand and wait 
listening through fog 
for the buzz of my plane 
two hours late. I love it 
here but I can't stay. 
My trip takes on a frame. 
I feel it going deeper 
like a dream, its 
salt in my pores. Flo Weyapuk said 
when I asked about that 
bone, a bit puzzled, a bit 
amused: "You found it. It's yours."
Climbing the ridge among cactus 
we watch the gritty town and gumball 
tourist cars. A man in that jail 
for a buck will give you a thrill, 
lurching from his cell 
with a drawn gun and a scowl. 

But my friend's young son, afraid 
of this tilted ground -- timid lamb -- 
holds out his stricken hands 
and shakes. Remember, Jon, 
that long unsettled night 
five years ago: we drank and talked -- 

what's friendship for? To move 
beyond the self. I felt 
you were a dying man. At four a.m. 
through empty streets I drove you home, 
and by the curb you held me hard 
and cried; unblessed by bourbon 

knowing that it was too late 
for sleep. Now it's your sweet 
blond diabetic son moves me 
toward tears, his frail-boned beauty 
like another of your heart-wrung 
poems, blood on a dusty street 

where the ghosts of men 
who could not name their fears 
so shot, each other down 
watch as the sun turns red and round 
and the cactus casts its thorny 
darkness to the ground.
    in my scraggly beard and the first 
sweat of the day glistening on my arms, 
I lay on a canvas cot, thinking of you 
and of another woman too raw for that land. 

Burnt flakes of shale, jeweled peppergrains 
of moletooth, limbbones packed in stone, 
a fence, a track through sagebrush, colors 
mute, regions of advanced decay: these 
inarticulate, inhuman cries are somehow mine. 

That August, back in the Village, 
an intimate catastrophe: 
your pale, cream-colored buttocks, lady. 
All the years haven't taken away 
what that day turned up missing. 

Given a life to spend, a bank of bones, 
two bodies tough as any blossoms, we 
took each other in hand. So this 
is what it means to live on earth: 

pressing warm skin within your skin, not 
tentative, not innocent, not knowing 

that would come later.
Chekhov, here's one story you 
didn't write: on a banker's 
estate, locked 
in one room without 
company, a man 
reads 
while outside 
the peasants grumble and debauch, 
the master gambles his fortune away, 
and so much blood is spilled 
the snow falls red 
all over Eastern Europe. 

                                  For years 
this continues: he reads 
the systematic philosophers, popular 
novelists of other centuries, 
lyric poets. Now the man 
is reading about beautiful women. 
He undresses and strides naked 
about the room, and as we watch 
he seems to age. His neat goatee 
lengthens, grizzles, his broad chest 
narrows, his face wrinkles, 
and his eyes grow round and hollow. 
Is this the parable: 
a man alone in a cell 
reading, while outside 
history 
chalks up another debacle? 

Fifteen years later 
bitter with what he's foreseen 
he renounces all claim 
and climbs out the window. 
Peasants are lined against the wall 
of the estate, and just as he hits the ground 
he notes a squad of soldiers aiming their guns. 
Crouching, he scrambles for cover. 
Now he stutters and falls, now 
he is crawling into the earth. I assume 
he had something else in mind. 
So many have died, are dying 
there are not enough stories to name them 
and those who are left could care less about such tales.
Its ice-cap, milky green, confirmed the name. 
Three volcanic cones leaned northwest 
from our camp. Soon we'd begun to dig 
and not long after reached stone. 
Here were plants, the fine impression of leaf, 
and the bones of cats. A strange animal 
culture baked in basalt. 

Higher apes had inhabited the island 
before musk ox, polar bears, and ice. 
Compasses began to spin. 
Two of our party went temporarily blind. 
One lost his mind for good. 
And lost on a glacier, looking for its source, 
presumed dead, our eldest son. 

That magnetic land, like nothing 
on the map, surnmerlong southern light 
glaring across its flatter regions. 
We brought a dozen 
frozen mammal specimens 
and minerals back to the coast, 
boarded an ice-breaker 
and crossed to Halifax. 
Last night, in fear, my breathing 
lost its rhythm. My lungs loose sacks, 
I lay among my ruin -- the yesterday 
of what we call "events" -- and saw 
myself, my wife and sons, this house 
blown terribly apart: the seeds 
of joy dry powder on the sheets. 

But when I woke, the look of things 
that change had changed, some magic 
in me boiling up again. I saw 
my room as a boy, the shelves 
of books, rocks, model planes. 
The smell of glue -- a strange delight, 
a sweet exuberant music filling my head. 

Not trusting happiness, my sleep's 
a laboratory with the scent of ash. 
Oh, Ben, your cries latch onto my breast, 
your silence attaches my heart. 
Because small parts can vanish 
in the night, the family is a chest 
of drawers I tuck my demons into. 

Three months ago, through gasps of pain, 
I watched your mother push you home. 
Awash with light, you blinked into 
this final state. You'd fallen 
through the ice, a simple corpuscle, 
agog with the palpable day, and wet 
with the dark inner life of the world.
A light with the richness 
of cream pours over the bar. 
Slack night. I sip a glass 
of beer remembering who I think 
I am and then forgetting. 
"Killing's more direct than talk," 

he says, says he could do it still 
but what's the use? His breath's 
a heavy metal stink about like dirt 
or the wide circles 
of waiting he pledged allegiance to 
before his birth. 

Camped in the Asian dark, 
sick on his first patrol, 
he tells me how they wouldn't 
talk to him, his alien platoon 
that first night out. Then 
something like a finger beckoning. 

He turns, hears in his middle ear 
a bird's frail tune, 
thick eons shouldering over oceans of recall. 
With hardly time to think 
he's off his stool, rolling 
in a fit of peanut shells and drool. 

The mind at war 
has got its reasons. Plunging 
in a sink of need, 
he's there as well as here 
hands tensed around his snub-nosed, 
sharp-toothed pet, 

and suddenly I could do 
with one less beer. Tomorrow 
if he lives he'll 
burn a village, be a vet. 
All wars are fought by country 
boys used to this long road.
One gray animal walked to the edge of morning. 
The moon was behind it and the road 
wound north, an infinite hill. 
And as there was simply no 
reason to proceed 
with the project it had set out on 
days before, it sat down. 

                                     Eyes 
are all I see of its gray face 
staring into the morning 
chilled past all desire 
having at last come to the end.
He holds round her waist, and runs 
past cream-white columns, down 
marble steps, this man who means 
nothing to her except escape. Her bones 
bend softly, her tongue a speckled leaf. 
Bright lumina surround her body 
like a sheet. Blood oozes from a V-shaped 
wound in her abductor's foot. Too wise 
to fight and too discreet, she 
watches it clot. And then a gap 
in the dream and years go by a blank. 

                        *

White sun invades a lazy afternoon 
as the tale resumes: the younger wife 
of an important magistrate 
she's stunned by the soldier's return 
who carried her off -- the stupid 
physical lout. Of course she's grown, 
of course he won't approach her 
on his own, but there can be no doubt 
(that V-shaped scar on his foot) 
and she finds she must have the man 
though it may mean her life. 

                        *

A smell of disinfectant over leaves 
where one sad girl has settled 
turning her body to the impossible 
earth. Molecules of air like mice 
come nibbling at her pores. Jody, 
we've never met, but I hold your 
book, its marvelous poems borrowed 
from grief. They whisper inside seeds 
where shadows are and know the universe 
which struggles to be free 
ends with the breaking of a single law.
The angles of his face tend toward dispersion, 
his ways are diffident, cold, unendearing, 

and you wonder about his childhood: 
how early this graceless scion of the gentry 
knowing that only his brains would carry him 
began to perceive those 
gestures and responses by which other people 
meet and get acquainted, gestures 
which he must study in order to know. 

It puzzles you how he managed to court his wife 
and what attracted her, whether 
it was despair 
or the thought that she (more fluent in gesture 
and in relationships) would eventually 
gain mastership in their house; or was it love? 

Probably it was love, and that thought 
makes you look again, 
noticing the cleavages in his face 
unable to soften themselves in any way. 

Would she say, "He is not easy to know 
but once you know him ... "? 

Now they have moved to Australia, 
and have left behind a cat ("Tiger Lily," 
mother of eight, who has moved into your house 
and keeps to herself where the warm air gathers 
on the attic stairs). Because of her 
you have recalled 
the isolation he must live with at every moment 
which the rest of us submerge in mere "relationships" 
until that time 
when charm and spontaneity can do us no more good 
and we must cast off, along with our confusions, 
the concinnity of features that was our mask.
Scouting the derelict station 
under Webster Avenue, the boy, 
just nine, enters a blind alcove, once 
the ladies' room, toilets and sinks 
removed. Soft boned and squirrel 

toothed, he thrusts his thin legs 
down through cracked concrete, twists 
into that honied clutch of blackness, 
rips a knee, grips at his arms' 
full length and dangles, then 

drops to the dank below. The flap 
of something venomous whirrs off 
into a corner. His eyes approach 
a thousand dead-end eyes and cut 
away. A giant crab from someone else's 

dream and all the shiftlessness of 
broken glass. -- Can't catch his breath. 
Hour after hour he watches the evening wane 
while trains sluggishly rumble their tedious 
freight of skeptical learning to the city. 

Past midnight, half asleep he asks 
for water and sees the hand of his mother 
reaching out a cup, which slips, falls free 
between them, wets his jeans. He curls 
around the stain, an utter fugitive. 

Straining into the dark, his 
eyes discern a series of points 
in space, a curving grid on which 
the world is hung. It seems to him 
that everything else is false -- 

what they say in school, at home. He feels 
older, almost grown, hears in his inner 
ear a vivid blues-tune rising. A sultry 
vibraphone plays moody runs 
as if that song is what he is 

when everything else is gone. Come dawn, 
he glistens with the wetness of 
that place and knows he must 
pile stones to make a stair. There 
on the ground beside him a silver 

dollar catches his eye, but he 
doesn't believe in money, won't 
take it up though it might get him home. 
This beautiful mischance has left him 
a finished thing. He starts to pile stones.
Glass from our broken car, 
and troopers taking it down. My 
bruised wife taken in by eager 
men, white coats under their parkas. 

Jeffrey leans beside me in the 
cab, his tiny hand in my hand, 
and, dazed and shaken, I'm 
surrounded by creatures from another 

time: three years ago, a 
continent away her labor carried 
deeper into pain than I could 
follow, her bleeding sat me dizzy 

on a stool. An inch of 
skull crossed with the black 
hatchings of his hair 
stood me up again, and then 

a face. Slowly his shoulders 
edging through a crack which 
opened from a prior space. These 
his first acts: he 

pees in his mouth, cries, 
then lying on his mother's 
breast unsqueezes into life 
his dark-accustomed eyes. 

An ugly green liquid seethes 
along the pavement. Now 
husband and son together 
in the patient lobby, furled 

upon themselves, hands of a 
clock without the clock, waiting: 
I'm afraid it will glow like 
this at the end of the world.
The impulse to mourn wakes me up like a clock 
and before I've taken thought, I'm out of bed 
squinting into the sun and full of minor worries, 
lacking a coherent plan 
to get through the coming day without disaster, 
a day already begun on the wrong foot 
    under which a luminous chasm opens up, 
-- or is this the continuation of a dream 
still taking place and am I still asleep? 

Across a continent of evil, asphalt, twisted metal, 
a military train plunges into a tunnel, kaackety-kaack, 
each car separate and distinct, each 
linked to a master plan and moving west 
into a landscape of baited terror. Meanwhile 
the trembling underfoot may cause a rash excitement 
verging on affirmation. -- We've 
passed the introduction 
to a structure capable of shifting definition 
as it unrolls into a temporary present. 

His face red in the glare, Hemingway on a balcony 
watches the fiery splash of bombs. Madrid. 
"'sbeautiful as hell." 

The photos age and fade. 
Only a vague light on the spleen remains, 
affirms the possibility of damage, 
the dignity eternal pain confers. 
Our weapons lose their edge 
and in this book, The Picture History of a War, 
the dates are noted and the bodies tallied    
as if it all had ended, turning into what we are.
Evenings, a roach of light scrabbling through 
the walls of an hieratic solitude 
as the frantic child imagines in procession 
twelve cauled and swaying men, 
    ghost-like, their torches 
spiraling into the cavernous 
moss-ridden vaults of the mind. 

And by dawn the autumn landscape holds in perspective 
flats and vectors, irreconcilable distances 
from which the spark of flint is never absent. 
The boy gathers leaves, desiring 
a paradise of ashes, while from the brow of the sky 
a pulsing threatening eye looks down upon the earth 
as on a dangerous son. 

Toying with matches -- see the magnificent havoc, 
the wrestling bright bodies of the flame. 
Look, as an ember surges and darkens, at the terrible 
filial fear of the boy. 
    And when the cooling ash dies out of his reverie 
his skin's as dry as a snake's, his fingernails singed -- 
alone and afraid, his darkness shifts under the house. 

And this deceitful beautiful reticence of fire 
that wavers deeply into the drowsing night 
as a cool blue mist, like the prodigious feat of will 
that, in the outlying suburbs of the present, can recall 
those ancient burning fields, that lurid sky 
where the moon, a calm and loving face, 
first went up in flames -- 

faster and faster, the long abyss of fire 
while in his arbitrary fury 
-- because in the end we are all 
lost, all 
dancing into ash -- he beats against the finiteness 
and infancy of time: the child, my dark-eyed son, 
may he never be born.
Dozens of swans and geese 
launched on its tar-black surface. 
Sixteen tiny jellyfish 
slosh against the breakwater: these 
are all the vacations of 
my life I didn't know how to use. 

Behind me on the rise 
my wife and child 
move into sunlight, 
disappear. And in the South China 
Sea, all those thousands of 
bodies going to the bottom...!

I am a way of looking 
up out of a mask 
encrusted with seaweed. One swan 
chases another for fifteen, 
twenty yards. A goose flaps and 
flaps, filling her 

wings with joy, but does not rise.
And when I grew furious and lashed out 
   at my wife in front of my young 
   son, it was myself I savaged: 
these things stare at me from the mirror 
   like the pale-skin legend 
   of a fall many years ago 
from a cliff. For three days Christ 
   on the wall hovered over me as I 
   lay on the ward. Friends said 
my personality then changed: I want it 
   to change again! Oh spinning parts 
   of what I am, machinery 
accountable to pain, whatever time 
   has written on the flesh 
   these pigments made of neon are 
dispersing. I have reached the age 
   of anger, temper me. I smell 
   myself a dying animal ... 
Everyone wants the colors of change 
   to fade. Since childhood I've felt 
   that distance in me: a hilly lawn 
a boy of three spins down, bright 
   health and sunlight rarely 
   tasted since. Later, at the fenced- 
in corner of a neighbor-yard, fierce 
   bushes and the dirt I'd 
   fallen into dizzy and upset. 
And so by means of craft I'd hoped 
   to restore lost sanctions, forgotten 
   blandishments. What else can I 
look for in this life? There is a 
   mountain in my mind I am climbing 
   pathless, rocky, a wildness of sky 
leaping from the earth like a fountain 
   I walk into naked, at once 
   exalted and depressed: what a colorful 
absconding! all in an instant as I 
   fall asleep and wake, die 
   and am reborn, and I can barely 
remember the mountain with its teeth 
   of salt and I have climbed it, 
   what was earth, now air.
Sunlight, shouts, and the incalculable 
odor of dew. If we could just forget 
the Portuguese men who catch 

fish, the farmers in Jersey 
turning out cabbages, if the 
cobbles were softer than pillows, 

it would be beautiful to be a 
Jew, if we could eat rust, if the 
rivers disgorged their findings, and those 

women in silk were our sisters. 
Not the accidental spilling of a 
pushcart, or that sly gentleman 

in the alley pointing his dummy 
lens at kids while he focuses a 
hidden copper plate at this bench 

where we sit, reviewing into his prism 
the brittle figures that dance behind 
our eyes. Lies. lies. And this perfect 

disarrangement of our thoughts re the 
unrecorded incidents in Egypt 
give cogency to what has not been said 

about the sunlight flashing off those 
girders, whose angular soft 
shadows lodge on our faces like glyphs.
Ghosts of our parents when we were young, 
the love we owed them has been paid back: 
their beauty, brittle but luminous, 
like a Monet when the lights 
in the museum dim and the single guard 
sits on a corner stool and reads 
in the evening news of a girl 
missing from home these past ten days. 

Stolen? Fled? But he is thinking 
of his daughter, grown 
away from him now, living in another 
city where her husband, the ineffectual one, 
sells shoes in a shopping mall, and thinking 
of his grandson, five, too big and awkward yet 
to learn to ride a bike: so in her latest 
his childish daughter complains. 

His smile half regret, as he 
puts down the paper, strolls 
over to where in the dim 
light the reasoned canvas 
seems to mirror back the eye's own 
aging. Into what? Not immortality, but 
something better, harder, some set 
matrix of located color which, refocusing, 

invites us out to luncheon on the lawn.
Sun going down, and its orange 
out of the west smothered the purple water -- 
odors of spring and change until we couldn't bear it, 
until as we looked down it faded like an echo 
of all that we had ever thought to do. 

Aqualungs, fins forgotten, along with the urge to dive. 
No desire to forgive the porpoises, the past, 
their casual alien games, irredeemably offshore, 
laughably, touchingly cruel. 
So all precautions proved useless, even the stars: 

we might just as well have stayed home. Always 
we stumbled, we fell on our own sweet wounds, 
could never get straight the facts of growing up. 
Too young we saw too much and understood only 
there are so many ways to bleed. 

Warm nights on the reef, vast as the strange is lovely. 
Now Paris and calculus fade into 
green eyes one had forgotten, once no doubt essential, 
a stubbornness along the pulse we cannot quite dismiss, 
cool in this rippled backwash of the absolute. 

So when dawn surprised us again in the usual way 
the fishes nibbling our toes made us laugh; but now, 
while a plague of twelve-pointed starfish 
sucks at the lives of the reef 
and the venomous face of the stonefish drops into shadow, 

at last we begin to see: it is as if 
the whole past rose up within us calling our names 
and our loves are each a small and perfect coral animal 
feeding itself to the water. Together they form 
a thousand mile reef, endlessly alive on the pastel corpse 

of uncountable coral dead.
After sunset when the grieving 
move further into their grief 
and the stars are revealed by their master, the darkness, 
I have left the cities of the blind 
along tracks straight and cold as the north. 

Here I sit listening on the shore 
of a white and glacial distance. 
The voice of a girl like an opening flower 
begins to curl forth from the inner shell of the mind. 
So many nights I have waited. 

In cities the darkness gobbled me up and spat me out, 
my fears scuttled back and forth outside the door. 
Now the first birds waken and peck among fresh snow. 
The light begins to open 
with a pink and icy whisper along her cheek.
Over meals the summer we were ten 
you spoke about a defect in your bones: 
how you knew you were going to die, 
just not when. Sitting at those 
long tables, skidding a half-filled 
salt-shaker fitfully down the boards, I 
knew the difference between us: 
I could never die. 

In Maine again years later 
I row toward the yellow lilies 
among pale cress, remembering how 
at camp the summer after, you 
were an absence like the deer 
which soon may enter these waters 
shyly, not yet seeing the stranger 
silhouetted in his boat. I asked 
another kid from Philly where you were. 
You were dead. But how could that be 
when I could see you so clearly in my head? 

Few friendships last. For this 
the elders gather in dark-brown churches 
to make their peace. Now 
I can't remember your face at all. 
Still, on the tongue of each lily 
staring, dazed in the humid heat, a fly, 
and out of the deeper silence 
I sense that in a moment 
a buck will break from those trees 
and splash into the lake. 

Astonishing, his size, 
the surge of his ruddy hide 
as he flees the hush of my voice 
back into the woods, an antler and a leap.

Something you can hardly put
your finger to moved into town
last night. This morning,
upon waking, we see our mountain,
who has stood behind us, is gone --
along with the range of hills
that were our stolid neighbors.
The backyard contains only
the children's sandbox littered
with toy trucks, pail and shovel,
the doghouse with rusted chain.
Beyond that tall pine lies
what new land? Is surf rolling
beyond that cloud veil?
Or is a river falling?
We need our landmarks back,
our old faithful ones
to reassure us this is the way
we have come before.
Unsure now if we are
on the right path to the garden,
we slow, look twice. Place our
feet carefully. First one step,
then another, discovering our way.
The earth beneath our feet
telling us as we wade through mist
This world of cloudy shapes,
froth of waves, mountain mist,
is still the world
underneath it all.
The brook's small talk
         won't bring you here
for six days and five nights

it's never going to ask you
for any money down
                                 or talk you

into anything... it's only
talking to itself
                            or maybe the oaks,
the tulip poplars
     it goes on

and on    its small vowels
colliding with consonants    mossy

rocks, eddying around in
leaf lined pools... it's saying

something about _the mourning dove's_
_low notes in the early hours_...

and            _white tails stepping_
       _down from hills to nibble_
                  _those sheep-nosed apples_
_from their black branches_...

                                                      it keeps
its rambling to itself
out of respect    for your own

reasons for coming here    friend
pay it no mind
                                         it wants you

to know it has always
gone on         like this

ever since    it was
a little bitty brook.
Give thanks these brief days
the lee side of the holiday
for one sad-looking
picked-clean turkey carcass.
With tenderness, bathe it
almost like you would a child,
lovingly. Cover with water
in a large pot and simmer a few hours.
Turkey will be swimming in the air
as the windows cloud.
Spoon out wishbone and thigh bones,
and the fragrant rafts of skin,
skim off the queasy decks of fat
from the surface of broth
and what's left takes on new life
with peeled baby carrots,
a yellow onion, some chopped celery,
leftover spaghetti noodles,
and the fresh sprig of parsley
you rescued this morning
from under dried oak leaves
blanketing your garden.
Sup on this hearty
innkeeper's soup to cheer you
the long wintry night,
stoke your home fire's flame
and warm you to the depths
of your hearthstone.
Give some small thanks
for the big bird
whose clipped wings
could not outfly
its fate and praise it
for its rising
to feed you
again.
No longer on the state road,
walking gravel, then double wheel ruts,
I go back the way I came once, walking
cross-country. Alders and beech light my way.

         * * * * *

The earth forgives me my trespassing --
pine needles, dried leaves, moss beds soft beneath.
Bills, mortgage, wife, neighbors,
I have left behind. Birch tree
welcomes me back. Staghorn sumac, laurel,
an old hickory. Now the lowdown scent
of skunk cabbage. Hello, Jack-in-the-pulpit.
High in branches a squirrel's bark
announces my arrival. It is always good
to be back. On cool black mud,
an orange newt with its bright red spots.

           * * * * *

I begin reading the signs.
Many small hands have come this way -- raccoon,
opossum, skunk. I walk until dusk
and find a friendly maple. Back against it,
I eat. Evening arrives as I drink my tea.

            * * * * *

Huddled against the cold in my poncho,
I begin to drowse but scurrying among leaves wakes me.
Sudden movements up the trunk and a visitor is perched
on my shoulder. Then up the trunk and onto my head,
surveying the world from on high. To surprise him
I move my head -- he disappears in a flash --
and chuckle myself to sleep.

         * * * * *

In the morning
I wake to find my boot laces
chewed into pieces.                   
At the pass, where the reservists fall
like spiders with their lines,
dangling down the carved cliff
where the engineer corps drilled
dynamite holes to blast through
the mountain for the four lane --
almost beyond my vision
in the dreamy twilight,
something shaggy and wild,
with a coat to hide in the long grass
of autumn, slinked across my path,
slipping beneath the guard rail,
escaping to the valley below.
Four-legged, it was something
not quite a shadow
gliding lost and nameless
into the shadows.
No moocher of table scraps,
but one dark loper
to lurk the edges
and dark depths,
to worry our bones
as we sleep.

Spirit-that-will-not-be-caged,
Moon-stalker,
you make goosebumps
and the little hairs of my nape rise.
Tonight, we will lock our
family pet inside all night
though she cries and begs
to join small movements
among the laurel
under the wide moon's light.
We will keep what is ours close.
Beyond the reaches of our lamps,
the night is yours.
   Like others we know
   you too take what you do seriously
   and are always doing
   what you do best.
   There is much to be admired
   in your steady persistence.
   Always pushing onward,
   never too tired.
   Even dog day afternoons
when your pace slows,
   and your riffles smoothe out,
   even then you pace yourself,
   like the long-distance runner you are
   at heart. Never resting in your lonely bed,
   alone in this life-work that you do,
   flowing towards your end, yet always
   with us here in our valley.
   We puzzle over your ways,
   reflect on your shores and probe your
   deep runs and shallows with our lines
   and flashing beads to lure your wildest secrets
   from the depths of your cold heart.
   Eluding our grasp, you do what you do
   naturally, following your natural bents
   and this narrow bed you have made.
   Still we are drawn to your banks
   by your falls, your white-water,
   and your quiet brooding
   over deep pools. Looking at you,
   charmed by your changeable features,
   we lose ourselves in your magical fracturing
   of light. You allow us to see ourselves
   in you. When we return, refreshed, from swimming
   your cool waters, our cares wash downstream.
   We thank you for this and more, for nourishing
   crops and stock, for the speckled trout our children
   bring home. We could not imagine this valley
   without your mists rising off you
   in early morning. Without you running
   through our lives, elbowing around
   these hills, where would we be?
Emily, oh Emily.
	Let's write this letter
	to the one who confused you;
	let's say you never wrote
	poems behind the scenes at Burbank Studio,
	never wore a mini, no knee-high leather boots
	or fired off a snub-nosed .38 or spat out
	the words, "Get back, Jack. Hands
	against the wall and spread 'em."

	Let's tell him to listen hard instead
	for a wind like a bugle
	or watch for any small movements
	among the tall grass giving away
	that narrow fellow parting the green blades
	as he goes, the common backyard garden variety
	still known to haunt barefoot maids
	in summer dresses along garden paths
	when the yellow squash swell on their vines
	and green beans hang like elves' stockings
	growing larger sizes overnight
	as if by some natural decree
	or prank of some divine pixy
	with a grin.
The shoe salesman sizes you up
with a glance, knows paperwork 
has you stymied...by your heels.
He reads your sole and sees
how many trips you take
to the water cooler.                                                           

The barber knows by the length
of your sideburns how much
you will pay for a haircut
and whether you will tip him,
and if you will stand for his
wheezing in your ear, or if he must talk
weather and politics with you
instead of this favorites,
sports and girls.

The grocery clerk can tell
you are what you eat,
as she rings up chips and Coke,
apples and aspirin, Wonder Bread
and cornflakes.

And if anyone could tell,
the bank teller could
tell how your life lies
in the balance or your house on the brink
of an abyss to make the fault line
look like a soft shoulder.

The druggist knows what
will lift your spirits and what spirit
you favor. He knows 
what relieves your tension.
And the masseuse too knows which ways
to rub you, and if it can be helped,
will never rub you wrong.
Sole brothers, homely twins,
they cower in the corner
of the closet, as if knowing
what their chances are
of  being asked to go anywhere.
Worn, slightly frazzled, almost
too comfortable and willing 
always to go wherever with
only a moment's notice --
a match for two elderly spinsters.

One brother is holey, 
the other owns a loose tongue.
Gone are those days I could go
anywhere with them.  When
I would polish their leather
until I could see myself
in their shine.  Together,
we would all go out
on the town.

But now, no more talk
of the old days. Today, I'm taking
them out for a walk. Next weekend
we may hang some windows -- or even
paint the back porch.
Nobody there is that doesn't love a bean.
If not the royal Navy bean, then the wax bean,
the soybean, the green bean, the black bean -- the
pot is large, it contains multitudes -- white bean,
pink bean, small red bean, the lowly pinto, the
lovely lentil -- let the lamp affix its bean -- or
the walnut-shaped garbanzo, large lima bean, baby lima,
(A reunion of the Bean families is here assembled),
the cranberry bean, white kidney bean, northern bean,
or their cracked cousins: green split pea, yellow
split pea, and ol' blackeye. A lineup 
of likely legumes. Gather ye bean-pods 
while ye may. Go and catch a falling bean
and if you catch one, let me know.
A man and a woman are one. A man and a woman 
and a bean are one, or two, or three.

The beans I mean, no one has seen them made
or heard them made, but at supper-time
we find them there.  Come live with me,
and eat some beans and we will love
within our means. One could do worse
than be an eater of beans.

Shall I compare thee to a summer's bean?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Had we but world enough, and time,
this coyness, Lady, were no crime.
But, at my back, I always hear
a pot of beans bubbling near.

Mark but this bean, and mark in this,
how little that which thou deny'st me is.
An aged bean is but a paltry thing.
I must lie down where all ladders start,
in the foul rag-and-bean shop of the heart.
O my love is like a red, red bean,
that's newly picked in June:
O my love is like a pinto bean,
that's truly cooked at noon.

So much depends upon a red kidney
bean. You might ask, Do I dare
to eat a bean?  Dry beans can harm no one.
They remind us of home sweet home,
home on the range,
home where the heart is.
Without expecting anything in return,
they give us protein, zip, and gas.
Add what you will -- onion, tomatoes, red
pepper, chili powder, juice of lemon,
salt & pepper to taste. Add ham
hocks, bring to a boil, simmer slowly.
Call your friends, serve with
panache, crackers, and green salad.

How do I cook them? Let me count the ways --
boiling, steaming, frying, baking.
And if these verses may thee move,
Sweet Lady, come live with me
and be my love. And if this fare
you disapprove, come live with me
and please be my cook.
              Once the ancestors
              of these kernels
              were the darkest secret.
              A prize guarded
              and handed down the long corridor
              of years.  Sorting seed by seed,
              a young woman could learn patience, 
	  and to pick and choose carefully.

              If she picked carefully,
              she might win a husband
              for all her days.                                                                  
Today I have walked fields 
and trails looking for flowers.
They reminded me
of your enjoyment
when I'd bring you
the blossom of the day.
No matter what -- brown-eyed Susans,
a wild iris, daisies --
always you were pleased.

Today I noticed tiny violets
and spring flowers I don't know
the names of, so I'll call them
shyest girl in the class,
little one in blue,
blushing bride of the valley,
belle of the mountain,
lady of the dell.
And one I'll call snow flakes
in her hair. They
remind me of
when we first met.
They remind me of you
as you were when I last saw you.
They remind me of when you were a girl
and I didn't know you.
     If you're ever too lost to find your way,
     you may find yourself here, beside
     the remains of a two-stall carwash.
     A camouflaged island with spray-painted
     beaverboard latticework hides the
     prehistoric gas pumps. What looks like
     a converted gas station up on stilts
     is and isn't. The horseshoe over
     the doorway testifies to the ups and downs
     of life along this river road.
     It says you're home and welcome
     before you're even in the door.

     Stuffed trophy trout hang mouths open
     on a cinderblock wall. One antediluvian
     space heater hunkers in the corner.
     Homemade apple pie reflects under glass.
     The cook looks in from the kitchen,
     wearing a dirty T-shirt, earring,
     and three-day stubble.

     You can't see your smile in the worn Formica
     tabletop but across the river is the Ratliff Brothers'
     trailer park -- eight trailers up on blocks
     and canes growing thick to the riverbank.
     Out the window the river wrinkles, and winks
     at odd moments when you gaze from your booth.

     The coffee is strong enough
     to jump-start you, in thick ceramic mugs
     that don't match, survivors of Jersey turnpike
     diners' auctions and fires. Here they have
     a second life. On a wall of compressed wood chips
     and glue hangs local art so dismal you don't want to ask
     where the waterfall is, the grey too grey
     and the brown too brown to be anything but dismal,
     with too little green, and surely nothing
     you can see clearly enough to give a name to --
     meager as the parsley snip with your sandwich
     and overcooked French fries.

    Quarters lie under clear plastic,
    imbedded in the oak countertop
    by the register. The girl who
    takes your money couldn't land
    a bit part anywhere but here.
    Her grandmother owns this place. 
 A hawk is circling, overhead.
 Tiny red spiders crawling all over the basalt.
 I have one good foothold, one good
 handhold, and need one more...
 either toehold or crack will do
 to keep me moving up, keep me
 from falling....

 Halfway between the summit
 and the scree fanning out below
 into boulders the size of VW's at the base,
 hugging the rock
 like an awkward lover,
 my cheek pressed against stone,
 yearning for the ledge above
 a hardscrabble birch leans from,
 hanging onto what little ground it has,
 too tough to say die,
 its few green leaves like toy flags
 waving life, its stand
 against the worst weather
 northerly winds dish out.

 The black top winds from the trees
 to the state road. Panther Swamp off to my left
 over my shoulder. Sun at my back warms the rock.
 Dried snakeskin on the dead limb. Why did I choose
 Rattlesnake Mountain? What do you do if on that ledge
 you come eye-to-eye with a coiled surprise? Turn sideways
 maybe, protect your eyes, and with your good arm whip it
 into space like lightning striking. But keep a good balance.

 My heart tied to goldline,
 top-roped to my brother
 on belay somewhere above me in the clouds
 tied to a scrub oak, his anchor.
 Hope it's strong enough to hold --
 him and me.
 Why am I here?
 Why am I climbing this again?
 How many times must I climb it?
 One more time.
 This time.
 May be the last time.
 One way
 or another.

  How's it going? My brother calls
  from his end of the line.
  Up, or down?
  Which is it going to be?
  That's a good question, I say.
  Tell you in a minute
  or so.

  Usually the questions nag about now --
  stopping for a breath
  about half-way -- seeing below
  how far I have come, seeing above
  where I have yet to go.
        Then he said, "Come here. Look at me.
        You're too beautiful" -- his hand
        flashed by her face and she almost
        laughed, almost thought he aimed
        to slap her and missed -- but
        the razor slit her cheek
        like a tomato, blood splattering
        her new dress. "Someday you'll know
        why I did it," he said, "And you'll
        thank me." She screamed through
        her bloody hands, "You -- you monster!
        You --You're not my father! You're
        crazy! A father is supposed to love
        his children. You devil. I hate you.
        Look what you did to me! I hate you."

        That was then. Months ago.
        Mark of her defiance at his word,
        the neglected curfew, her laugh
        behind his back. A thin scar
        across her cheek marks their skirmish
        in his holy war against the flesh,
        which he knows too well --
        didn't he marry her mother?
        Tonight she negotiates with him
        for her release in his favorite
        yellow polka dot dress.
        Beyond the streetlight an engine
        idles. Her mother knows what she
        is fighting for -- her love, hate, life.                                                             
Two noisy young men have left
the obscure, dim bar lights inside
of what looks like from here
a sorry-excuse for a roadhouse
and have come outside
Into brilliant daylight,
bringing their disagreement with them
into the grimy parking lot
with its broken beer bottles
and oil-spotted pavement.

They curse and insult each other,
slapping, then shoving, and
grappling over car hoods and rolling
onto the filthy pavement. They break
apart and begin boxing. A few wild punches
and then, one or two, connect.

Who knows what they're fighting for?
Miss America, waiting inside,
with too much mascara, and perched
on a bar stool, cooing her displeasure
at "all the fuss" as she cozies up
to another Mai-Tai, perhaps?

One has short hair and the other long --
now the short-haired one grabs a fistful of long hair
and pulls, slamming his fist into the other's face,
now that he cannot escape....

It almost always comes down
to your vision of the beautiful
and your belief
that you are the right one.
From the heavens' roiling,
I was singled out on the hill.
Out of clouds, out of darkness,
out of thunder, come
         the light, the power.
         Singled out, I was
         struck blind
         by a fire-bolt.

         Later, they all flocked around me,
         wondering when I rose
         and spoke to them.
         Startled into speech, they
         asked of that no-man's land
         from which I had come, a traveler
         upon the road they would all
         one day travel.

         I could not tell
         what they would hear.
         They touched my wound
         and drew back. They feared
         and marveled. It was said

         I was a man among men
         but touched by the light,
         power, darkness, thunder.

         I could not see
         what they saw.
         They rallied around.
         They cried I had vision --
         I, who was blind.

         The heavenly bolt wounded,
         cauterized, branded me -- at once
         my curse, fame, glory.                                                           
Hide from heron under the cutbank
when he comes. Upstream the speckled brook,
my little brother, leaps, smashing the sky
into pieces. Mosquitoes swarm above.
Down here I lie beside my rock,
the siren song of the wild water
reaching me here where I live
down from the source calling to my need.
Soon I will be climbing the falls.
Hide from bruin's swipe, raking my run --
confusion like osprey's dive into these waters,
talons worse than the eagle's claw.
All's a flowing. Current is always passing.
I hold, and it brings me what I need,
angleworm, grasshopper, ant, damselfly, snail.
Gratefully I accept earth's offerings.
Nose to the current, behind this rock
I take what comes when it comes
or tail turn at the forked thing's twisted mayfly
lying unnaturally on a stonefly day.
Those times, rust flavors my musing,
I nurse an old wound. The barb deep in.
The current flows all around me, wherever I go.
A dull ache keeps me steady. White-water or brown,
it argues against my forgetting.
      There is nothing else in the world
      like it.
      It is a foreign country
      you somehow find yourself in
      where the only words you hear
      are those that rise within you
      like exotic fish rising from depths to kiss
      the surface of a pond into ripples.
      It is a nearby foreign land
      where your words echo 
      off the walls of your room.
      You are in this country alone.
      Another name for it is
      the life you have chosen.
      Solitude is the path
      that brings you here.
      Jays jabber in the trees,
      thunder reverberates in the valley.
      You learn the many voices
      of the rain. One day you begin
      speaking in one of the world's voices
      as if you had forgotten your native tongue.      

       One day a visitor finds you
       and speaks words you once knew.
       A voice rises within you -- the words
       that escape from you like caged birds
       suddenly freed fly around the room
       and her words--together all the words
       fly around and around
       in joyous circles, brushing lightly
       each other's wings. Together
       you sing a happy song. The two of you
       travel together into a new country
       where your words take you both
       by the hand, showing you the way.
       You learn the way together.
       Along this path there will always be
       an answer to your question,
       a question waiting for your answer.
       You will not be lonely.
       This is a new land you are discovering.
       There is nothing else in the world
       like it.
   You, who are reborn,
   find yourself young
   even as your children age.
   Once again you say you have found
   the gift you thought was lost.
   You give thanks and tell everyone
   the good news: each day we are born
   again. Child of the morning,
   may the spring rains fall gently
   upon you as you tend your garden,
   may song birds sing for you
   from the tops of your father's maple trees
   and the new sun strengthen you
   as you smile at your sons revolving
   around you, the center of their
   universe. May your husband learn
   every thing you wish him to know,
   and as you walk hand in hand with them
   may the sea breezes be kind and the water-
   birds favor you with their graceful
   ministrations on the air as their various
   calls and chattering mingle with your voices
   and laughter in a hymn of praise.
That was a clear day
when you sat in the parlor,
the day your granddaughter
and I came to call: there
was no baby crying in the other room,
no rain coming through
a hole in the roof, no smoke
from burning oak leaves
filling up the front room;
the sun was bright on the mountains
of slack outside Morris Run.                                                                

I didn't know then about those dark days
when air hangs heavy
with coal dust and the mind
loses its way. The women
gone, you conned me into rifling
drawers for the cigars
you planted earlier. We smoked
up until blue-grey clouds
hung from the ceiling.                                                                

You told me more than the story
of the big buck stepping from pines
each morning at sunrise
to nibble sweet flesh
off your apple trees, something
more than the claim
that the rainbows of the Susquehanna
light the eyes like white-water
falling far and fast:  sometimes                                                                

for those who share the light
and the air a while with us,
we must give our breath
to fan the flame, for it too quickly
becomes a smoldering ember
in a darkened cave.
       Northman, the potato flower
       is delicate as any, yet common
       and white. It grows anywhere
       far to the north, your country
       of pine treed mountains, deep, blue
       lakes where square tails divvy
       the currents between them.
       Remember the green smell of pine,
       the glue from pitch blacking
       your hands long after the climb
       down broken limbs, its sticking to
       a shirt someone ironed for you?
       And the speckled brookies leaping
       for mosquitoes, snaky streaks of
       nervy energy fighting always to the end
       the eagle claw hook buried deep
       in the gut? They are there,
       still, far back, away from the state
       roads, the party lines, the concrete
       walks of The Hardware City, where your
       friends danced the fox-trot
       to the tune of the Second World War.
       Conveyor belts of brass hinges gave way
       to shell casings. You became a leatherneck.
       The Marine dress blues uniform
       recruited you. The fighting colors
       of a bantam cock of the walk. From the
       halls of Oak Street to the shores of Iwo Jima.
       When the cockfight was over there,
       offshore breezes sickened downwind sailors,
       their green faces matching your fatigues.
       They arrived too late, bringing fresh K-rations,
       new pics of Grable and Lamour, the latest
       baseball scores, and other news
       from far off Eden. The swabbies looked
       around, shuddering. Tears like streams flowed
       full down their faces, they cried joyful stories
       of home in front of your eyes with wild gestures,
       anything to drive the look away, to bring back
       memories of the wall, and garden, pear tree
       growing in the backyard, your neighbor's doves
       cooing from their rooftop cages.
 The best fishing hole was legal
 if you weren't caught, my cousin
 said, on one of those nights
 the mayor fished with off-duty officers.
 I had trouble believing my cousin
 sometimes, then something would happen,
 and I'd believe him. Like the night
 he caught a barrel full. 

 After the long hike down the mountain,
 he said they were still alive.
 So we watched him dump them, foul water
 and all -- catfish, pike, bass --
 into a hogshead. Gulping fresh water,
 they couldn't believe such sweetness.
 Finning slowly, reviving in the April rainwater,
 like patients gradually recovering, suddenly
 entering the River Jordan. 

 Days later, the moss-backed barrel
 full to brimming, they spooked easily,
 alive to the crunched gravel
 of our approach. Five black, head-shaking bullheads,
 whiskers groping. A green pike long as your forearm
 rose and fell like a submarine, finning the clear water.
 A little big-mouth bass, holding his own among the big cats
 and the giant pike, going head-to-head with them
 for elbow room, jawing at them in self-defense
 like the only little man on a court of six-footers,
 making what moves he has to--an elbow, head-feint,
 dribbling between their disbelieving knees.                                                                
Wanderer, wherever you go,
whenever you drink again
from these melting snow fields,
the fog will slowly rise
off this lake of clouds,
you will walk softly
and not disturb
the wood-drake's dance,
the partridge's drumming,                                                                

for the white-tail's hoof prints
in cool black earth
beside the flat stone
upon which you kneel to drink
have impressed this upon you.

What if early death
or loss of friends
or love rejected or

gone unknown
into the hungry air
should down me

brushing my teeth
hunting for gray
in my hair

listening to the radio
on a dreary Sunday P.M.
fear is the floor

beneath the rug
Nat Cole singing
Once in a While
Sometimes a head and then a body.
Sometimes a body placed
beneath a head. And then:
who are these people?

Sometimes, on the street,
you see one. And another then.
And the sun in the sky like a swinging door.
And who are these people? Or,

they gather sometimes. Some
you see at tables
huddled around their drinks
as though the drinks were flames.

Others appear and vanish
in strobic vignettes. One
sits by you spilling
her marriage woes. (Who is she?)

You want to give her something.
Take this sandwich, please.
She won't go away. There is
no end to others.

They won't go away.
And the sun in the sky like a swinging door.

Who are these people
waiting in line like a list
of grievances? Where
does this line go? To the sun?

What do they want? Lips
move and hands gesture.
They are pointing to the sun.
They want it to go away.

Sometimes it is dark.
The streets are empty. You can hear
the doors close like sighs
of relief. Heads

and bodies
placed tenderly on beds.
They want each other to go away.
And millions of dreams filled with petitioning.
Never to repair the wounds of heaven,
but to lie in bed and dream of China
burdened by small breasted women
and friends who imply great sorrow in a touch
as thousands of miles away
love lies buried under the Wall of China,
memory vanishing like jars filled with tokens.

China's cities are wedded to the stars,
her maps held together by rivers.
The women of China have small breasts.
The first born are kept in jars.
When the women of China sob,
the rivers unlock a secret door
where Confucian perversions dominate.
The honey of heaven drips slowly from their breasts.

Where once I planned mass executions of my friends,
a telephone stands.
The line to China is busy.
Countless fingers grow from the phone
as grievances increase.
I consider the manifest destiny of a leaf.

With Rimbaud-like motions my friends explore China.
What I remember barely fills a jar.
The moon hunts out its pirates.
My friends plunder telephone booths
in claustrophobic fits of passion.
I place the white thread of sorrow
around the neck of a small breasted woman.

The Chinese laugh at the moon.
They fill their ships with leaves and dreams.
Endless sorrows plague their government.
Their gold outlives their beards.
Honey drips.

My small breasted friends are strangled by sorrow
My pain resides beneath the shadow of the moon
where the wounds of heaven pour forth
oriental madness to kill our dreams.
And my Chinese friends, numerous as telephones,
babble on like rivers . . . like rivers.
I bore myself a long way
in my hands,
saw myself struggling across the bleak terrain
of Bergman's Seventh Seal,
where Death leads his victims in a dance.

And though it was a dream
I wanted to come through,
convince myself of something. I don't know what.

In the faint light of the winter solstice
a cat stretched across my chest
pawing mindlessly.
I thought of Scott Fitzgerald's hell in Hollywood,
of his gestures shrinking into failure.

I lay back on the wrinkled sheets of the bed
watching the past contract
to a dot of blue light,
calmed by the fact of the house
and of what exists without a thought of me.
Doesn't it matter that I'm
crouched in the corner
reading by light
of an invisible moon?

I'm reading the oldest story
you could ever dream. . . .

Something about hands
spying on each other,
something about casting bread
and waiting by a river.

Doesn't it matter that hope
dogs me through the future,
false and the other kind
with one good wing?

I need a table shaped like an oar,
another life to sleep in.

I need someone to catch the difference
as it stumbles
not knowing where to fall next.
Working lives out by phone
is no less futile than by poetry.
It's all voice: in the head
or out, up the coast or down.
You'd think there was some way
to have coffee in a quiet shop,
find time to reminisce.
All the really good gestures are gone,
forgotten in this state of surfaces.
You say it's raining in San Francisco.
Last week the Santa Anas blew
blustering down the avenue
close to the ground.
You have to take everything as omen
when there's no interior to work through.
You have to say something, even
simply hello,
stretched like a hyphen between climates.
This is my place
and the time moves
as I choose. And I
select the songs
that make a simple
grace of quiet.
Common courtesy,
I know, dictates
otherwise, but sit
here on the floor
by me. The couch
is awkward and made
neither for love
nor comfort. Don't
be hesitant. Just
settle down.
So.
Beneath the floor
I hear my neighbors
fucking: the precise
syllables
of earned passion,
the 'oohs' and
'ahs'
of delight
drift up.
Here
is tenderness,
later playfulness
and the small attentions
of lovers. Again,
and still again
their insistencies
drift upward. Lovers,
unconcerned.

I turn on the radio,
hear the astronauts are ill
in the vastness of space,
sick
to their stomachs
and their craft failing.
Christ,
can we ever surmount
these difficulties.

And this morning
I heard a pigeon
going crazy in the eaves,
flapping
as though caught,
beating his wings
with terrible urgency
against the house.
What could I do,
anyway,
but listen
till he freed himself.
The day caught him
unaware.
He had risen only
to break

the great chain of sleep,
read poetry
if the elements permitted.

Bending over the flower,
a weed, he saw
a pivot for satisfaction

to turn on,
absorbing nuances of sunlight.

And knew he needed
a hand, an arm,
something breathing to lean upon
and make small talk.

He needed her to arrive home
that moment
and enter the garden,
to share delight
as it circled closer,

no longer a phantom,
nor imperceptible.
Slower and slower the days pass.

The rain gathers and departs
in a fine mist,
a clinging invisibility.

He stands at the garden's gate,
watches dimensions collected like old debts,
the endless traffic of the present.

All depth is taken.
He's left with his life's flat edge.

What can he say that bears repeating,
that he could say again
and not diminish?

No one calls.
No one comes to call.

The meat of a word
lodged deep in his throat.

The marrow and bone.
The song's motionless in the air.
The bird is.
Then descends to the bush.

The dog whines for nothing.
Nothing will come of it.
No one will feed her,
comfort her.
She paces, frantic,
the narrow channel between
their house his fence.

He checks the mail
knowing quite well
it hasn't arrived.

The noon ritual. Regardless.
Playing the stops of time.

He should send himself a card:

"habit's vainest creature
the man singing to himself."That is to say.

Sitting in the semi-dark
telling the phone to ring,
what small insistence he contains
wasted on the mute instrument.

Who is the man
who's known to be alone,
who craves the company
of only one woman?
The curse of his family men:

to be dumbly domestic,
to be unable to help themselves,

to sit in a chair after dinner
curled like a cat
wrapped in his own heat,

to bed alone
pretending to be asleep
on and on
in the dark room till dawn.
The burden of proof. Resting
in the easy chair.
Soliciting footsteps:

this one a male,
this a female.

Who will arrive
to break the spell of poetry?

Lives dazed into art by syntax.

A map of suffering
giving no relief.

That evening
he saw the satellite
pass through the sky
one frame at a time,
and felt the tenses shift.
The story that forgets to tell itself is no less a story than the one that begs to be told nor is that reluctance a virtue but, simply, a posturing for that attention each story craves. What a sorry sight: a man sits at his desk trying to write a story. He's been there two, perhaps three hours knowing there is no story to write, and that any story that does get written will be the activity's story, not his. The typewriter hums distractedly as a man does busy at some menial task. He needs an electric typewriter because he has confused the weary expression "plugged in" with the literal fact of being plugged in. He believes the network of wires of which his fingers are an extension actually is a conductor of words. It's all a silliness out of Cocteau's radio and should have been left in that place. The typewriter is humming "It's quarter to three, there's no one in the place except you and me." But now he is hearing the voice of the woman singing in the bedroom softly and seductively, almost to herself. Had she forgiven him their quarrel or was she mocking him, bored, peeved at placing second to that machine? Weary, unable to locate inspiration, he rose from the defeat from which he fashioned pleasure, defeated in his heart again.
In fact, the time did weigh heavy on his hands. It was a substance fashioned from available material. Some
thing that could hold or be held. Or, in the story, it was a woman sitting in the corner of the room reading
a book. Calling it a woman, it acquired shape and a pleasing countenance, a quaint tilt of the head, a manner of fussing with her hair. He was pleased that he could relegate this factor to the role of an image. He wanted to explain the process, to lay out the associational links of his imagination, but something prevented him. Now he wanted to ask her what she was reading, to make small talk, to justify his own presence in the room. But she was engrossed in the book. He knew she was edgy, if disturbed she would leave the room abruptly with practiced gestures, familiar moves, the index finger of her right hand marking her place in the book. It was possible the book was a prop, that, in the story she was watching him standing at the window. He would turn to her and smile, give acknowledgement of her presence, but she would say something cutting about how he wasted his days and they would quarrel. He watched the weather shift. A slowly unfolding pattern of clouds moved in from the mountains, floating high and thin-edged like the pages of a book, The light turned gray and dull along the edge of the sky.
The plane, moving against time, against the motion of the sun, was an instrument for healing, cutting from his system the melancholic idea of that other place. He wanted to be free of the sense that all possibility was attended by regret so that the future was bathed in nostalgia. In all the simplicity of the term he wanted to
be here. The woman sat in front of him. She was lovely the way certain fashion models are lovely, a face made to extract a reaction of distant admiration. Her cheekbones, two dramatic sweeps, were faint allusions to the primitive. There was a blond, perfect child on her 1ap; another peered out the window; a third, considerably older, he took to be a brother. He wanted to meet her. More exactly, he wanted to know her, to come to her with a shared past and the assurance of a predictable future. He wanted to ask her how she was and what she was up to, and not have to explain himself, to endlessly explain himself. But all through the flight the child squawled and cried. Later, in the city, he strolled through a museum trying to fix his image in each image presented him, pained to think he had to see himself in terms of something else until all that he was was outside himself, distant and metaphorical. He listened disinterestedly to the story until he could distinguish her voice. They walked together slowly through a Miro exhibition. He made a trivial comment on Miro's imposition of form upon surfaces that seemed to stretch to infinity. She nodded, and he was pleased she saw the work through his eyes. Coffee later, and then he accompanied her as she shopped for children's clothes. They parted uneasily in the evening rush retreating to the edge of a story neither would tell the other within the frame of a story telling them to itself.
Bewilderment
adorns your faces
like a keepsake
you mouth
the one word
the future allows
pardon
like a guest
entering the small dark
of a closet
apologizing
to the clothes
Smoke is rising from the boiled potatoes
in the rose-bottomed bowl
on my grandfather's table. My father

is waiting for the rose to appear
pried from the weight of the family's hunger.
Above the table, like a spirit
unsure of which body to enter, the smoke lingers. Eat!

my grandfather urges. Eat. Eat
and grow stronger. Eat
so the rose will appear.
In a novelist's Warsaw,
in a long shabby coat,
a red bearded Jew stands on a street corner
nodding his head.

The future whispers in his ear
in Yiddish. He shrugs.
Nothing surprises him.

He will walk down that street
entering any room they tell him to enter.

He will board that train
pretending to pretend it's a mere relocation.

In the prayerhouse the Messiah plays cards,
killing time.
He makes bad jokes like a traveling salesman.
He farts and forgets to apologize.
My parents were fish.
They came from Europe, swimming.

This was before Hitler was invented,
when a wheel barrow of money
got you a loaf of bread.

Twice, they voted for Stevenson,
and he dropped dead on the streets of London.

Mamie was drunk. McCarthy mad.

They did their jobs.
They didn't weep over the Rosenbergs.

They tried to buy their way
out of history.
The rising elevator was their armor.
The wolf at the door was the family crest.

Two weeks before he died, my father smiled wisely
over murdered Kennedy, and lifted his shovel
and bent his back,
and went to dig in the streets of gold.
The year I am born
the Paradise plays
"The Best Years of Our Lives."
Turning the corner
onto the Grand Concourse
you stop, claw for your heart
with your wrinkled scholar's hands,
sprout wings and rise
above the Bronx. Uncle,
you were the first to reach
the suburbs: a small plot
out on the Island.
Today, you do not lack
company. All the wives,
the wise guy brothers
with their flies at half mast
have joined you.
Their only assimilation.
You were The Oldest.
The Saint. The Brain.
A half dozen languages
so why isn't he married?

Say it is early Spring.
You arrive at your sister's
bearing lox, bagels and rolls
warm from the oven.
My father sits by the window,
remote, a wage earner.
You two don't talk.
As he looks on, and my sister,
awed, looks on,
you touch my mother's belly
hat still pushed back on your head
and say the one word
for hello, for good-bye.
The fool sat on the steps
singing his song
in a wordless whine.
I climbed beyond him
through hallways long and dark
as subway tunnels
running under the water,
feeling my way, opening doors
into strangeness
strange for all that was repeated:
the shapes of those rooms,
the furniture
turned from the sun
to save their dull colors,
the old world odors.
I heard the words
shatter against the wall
like empty glasses, the steps
of the troubled husband
tapping out a code, rain
in the courtyard
soothing the soot covered leaves.
Far below,
I saw the light trickling
into the deep well of the stairs,
and knew it would rise, floor to floor
seeking its level, seeking
me finding my room,
tender and remote as a parent
to bear me half waking,
half sleeping.
I lived there.
When I fell in at five,
they fished me out.
The stranger holding me
laughed, his trousers rolled up
like shirt sleeves. My mother,
drowning on the shore,
could find no life to pass by
worth living twice. Years later,
I made him her lover.
From the distance, as I played,
I watched them together
sitting quietly on a bench near the pond.
They came from the same town.
My mother marveled
that people might live so close
yet never meet. They laughed,
rose from the bench
and strolled by. The ducks
sparkled gaily in the sun.
My mother knelt to feed them bread,
stirring her hand over the water.
My father's silhouette sneaks a smoke
in the john. The fire he swallowed forty years ago
exits in small shapeless puffs he studies indifferently.

On the rooftop, friends watch for missles
that will brush by them gentle as the breath
of a shopper in a department store.

The grocer walks by with his finger to his lips
like a town crier in a ghost town. He has a method
for surviving holocausts.

His heart is a heap of ashes
occasionally flaring.
One spring day
in the woods in Germany,
I found a piece of string
tied carelessly around a tree.

A couple strolled by and embraced.
I watched from a rock
as they stepped into the deep woods
together.

I remembered a photo of myself
in a row of children,
the names holding down the tiny faces
like paperweights,

and one of my mother
dressed as a gypsy,
eager and young
before the birth of her daughter.
At that height
they might be four black stars
or the small dark eyes of my ancestors
bereft of kindness.

In their beaks they bear
the scroll of my life: the story
I don't know how to tell.

Their endless orbiting might be an alphabet
spelling the same words again and again:
like,
and as though.
Their faces are breaking free
again. The door blows open.
They can walk into any dream they choose.

They choose yours. They put their faces
on your face. You yank them off.
They appropriate breath. They float above you

like smoke. They resemble you.
You resemble them.
They are crying. Alive,

they never cried. You see them
shrunken in their immense coffins
like babies in bathtubs.

There are too many.
Too many griefs to choose from.
And you don't know which you prefer.
Beneath their beards
they are fading
like Victorian photographs.

They stare straight ahead
beyond you, beyond the wall,
beyond fatherhood
to a camera lens
embedded in a skull, embedded
in a Jew in western Russia.

Their families surround them
like jewels on a crown,
like dung around a dray horse

Fearing erections,
children may not sit
on their laps.
Fathers without sons: smoke
without fire. They can't enter heaven.
Hell won't have them.

Hands in pockets.
A new t.v. not yet paid for.

They read the paper
weeping at the sports section.
Who will go out for a pass
in the dark night of the soul?

They roam' the house,
opening and closing doors.

In the bedroom,
a mirror grows a face from loneliness.
The face grows a beard.

Mothers in corners like spider webs.
A father with roots for feet stands in the yard,
stamps down hard, and stretches out his arms.

Soon there is a lovely shade tree for the family.

Mother sits beneath it, sipping lemonade, knitting,
her legs tanning gently beneath a billowy summer dress.

The children build a swing in it.

The youngest climbs all the way to the top
where he stands with his arms stretched straight up,
his feet in father's eyes.

"There," his mother says, "you're that much closer
to heaven."
They are terrified of them.

They hear them pacing
inside
like prisoners in a cell.

In a train
returning from work,
they hear them whispering to other hearts.

They will not sleep with their wives
tonight.
This trembling hand a wing.

This dreaming head an engine.

This newspaper over the face
a distant shimmering landscape,

a snowy alpine region
where figures the size of cells
wave frantically for rescue.
They hear the coffin woo the nail
with promises.
Sounds like the breath of a fevered child.

To slam a door
is to open a wound.

To open a door
is to court disaster.

Snoring is a lifeline,
a trail of crumbs through the spooky woods
back from the terrible cottage.

Waking up a vindication.
How peacefully he sleeps in that harvest.

An awesome-bossomed goddess
graces the field. Loaves
appear magically at her feet
and toddle off like children.

All is gold and happens slowly.

Capitalism rises
discretely
as a gentleman's erection.

Stones for a house gather at the field's edge.

Father sighs in his sleep.
He wakes on the bus
weaving through pits and dumps
to the edge of the city.

His lunch pail guides him like a seeing eye dog

Skinny cranes flay the air,
necks as beautiful as swans'.

The factory whistle sighs
like a disappointed goddess.

The Industrial Revolution sits in a chair
chain smoking.
On the ship the wind
caught up mother's kerchief
and father trembled.

In the harbor, shit-stained gulls
caroused overhead
creating an alphabet.
Father learned English then,
the language of birds and the future.

"Oh you kid," he said, and
"I can't give you anything
but love,
baby."

Mother's skirt rose straight up
and fluttered like Peary's flag
over the North Pole.

Or was it the South?
Families come from everywhere,
convinced he is theirs.

A mother's yowl
pours out like smoke.

A son climbs it --
Jack in the Beanstalk --
and meets his infancy coming down.

Beneath the earth,
skin deserts skull
for a, new face.
Perhaps they are here.
Something is.

Something trails you
sneaking from doorway to doorway
like a cheap detective.

Something you can't shake:
a feeling with skin.

You turn around.
You turn and turn and turn
dancing on the street corner

like a compass needle
gone crazy.
A gnarled tree twisted in the heart
makes of the tongue a dry leaf.

Winter night.
A pair of shivering blackbirds
perches in the throat.

The moon drifts behind the eyes,
drowns the family in darkness.
Some fathers
have no sons.

Blood seeking wounds.
A son can't sleep.

There is a light in the corner of the room.
A liquid light
dripping from the ceiling.

"What do you want?" the son asks.

The light drips.
It just drips.

He places a bowl beneath the light.
He stays awake all night watching the light
drip into the bowl. It just drips.

In the morning he finds the bowl filled
with clear warm water,
and shaves with it.
Fathers dancing in the moonlight.
Sad fathers. Horny fathers.

Bone weary, grief dancing fathers
while their families sleep.

Fathers whose wives
turn at night to the wall,
who have sired flea-brained sons,

whose hearts turn on them
like ungrateful children.
Fields of fathers swaying like flowers.﻿



    Song of the Bowmen of Shu

    Here we are, picking the first fern-shoots
    And saying: When shall we get back to our country?
    Here we are because we have the Ken-nin for our
        foemen,
    We have no comfort because of these Mongols.
    We grub the soft fern-shoots,
    When anyone says "Return," the others are full of
        sorrow.
    Sorrowful minds, sorrow is strong, we are hungry
        and thirsty.
    Our defence is not yet made sure, no one can let
        his friend return.
    We grub the old fern-stalks.
    We say: Will we be let to go back in October?
    There is no ease in royal affairs, we have no comfort.
    Our sorrow is bitter, but we would not return to our
       country.
    What flower has come into blossom?
    Whose chariot? The General's.
    Horses, his horses even, are tired. They were strong.
    We have no rest, three battles a month.
    By heaven, his horses are tired.
    The generals are on them, the soldiers are by them
    The horses are well trained, the generals have ivory
        arrows and quivers ornamented with fish-skin.
    The enemy is swift, we must be careful.
    When we set out, the willows were drooping with spring,
    We come back in the snow,
    We go slowly, we are hungry and thirsty,
    Our mind is full of sorrow, who will know of our grief?

                                    



    The Beautiful Toilet

    Blue, blue is the grass about the river
    And the willows have overfilled the close garden.
    And within, the mistress, in the midmost of her youth,
    White, white of face, hesitates, passing the door.
    Slender, she puts forth a slender hand,

    And she was a courtezan in the old days,
    And she has married a sot,
    Who now goes drunkenly out
    And leaves her too much alone.

                                    ._




    The River Song


    This boat is of shato-wood, and its gunwales are cut
        magnolia,
    Musicians with jewelled flutes and with pipes of gold
    Fill full the sides in rows, and our wine
    Is rich for a thousand cups.
    We carry singing girls, drift with the drifting water,
    Yet Sennin needs
    A yellow stork for a charger, and all our seamen
    Would follow the white gulls or ride them.
    Kutsu's prose song
    Hangs with the sun and moon.

    King So's terraced palace
                           is now but a barren hill,
    But I draw pen on this barge
    Causing the five peaks to tremble,
    And I have joy in these words
                           like the joy of blue islands.
    (If glory could last forever
    Then the waters of Han would flow northward.)

    And I have moped in the Emperor's garden, awaiting
        an order-to-write!
    I looked at the dragon-pond, with its willow-coloured
        water
    Just reflecting the sky's tinge,
    And heard the five-score nightingales aimlessly singing.

    The eastern wind brings the green colour into the island
        grasses at Yei-shu,
    The purple house and the crimson are full of Spring
        softness.
    South of the pond the willow-tips are half-blue and
        bluer,
    Their cords tangle in mist, against the brocade-like
        palace.
    Vine-strings a hundred feet long hang down from carved
        railings,
    And high over the willows, the fine birds sing to each
        other, and listen,
    Crying--"Kwan, Kuan," for the early wind, and the feel
        of it.
    The wind bundles itself into a bluish cloud and wanders off.
    Over a thousand gates, over a thousand doors are the sounds
        of spring  singing,
    And the Emperor is at Ko.
    Five clouds hang aloft, bright on the purple sky,
    The imperial guards come forth from the golden house with
        their armour a-gleaming.
    The emperor in his jewelled car goes out to inspect his
        flowers,
    He goes out to Hori, to look at the wing-flapping storks,
    He returns by way of Sei rock, to hear the new nightingales,
    For the gardens at Jo-run are full of new nightingales,
    Their sound is mixed in this flute,
    Their voice is in the twelve pipes here.

                                    



    The River-Merchant's Wife: a Letter


    While my hair was still cut straight across my forehead
    I played about the front gate, pulling flowers.
    You came by on bamboo stilts, playing horse,
    You walked about my seat, playing with blue plums.
    And we went on living in the village of Chokan:
    Two small people, without dislike or suspicion.

    At fourteen I married My Lord you.
    I never laughed, being bashful.
    Lowering my head, I looked at the wall.
    Called to, a thousand times, I never looked back.

    At fifteen I stopped scowling,
    I desired my dust to be mingled with yours
    Forever and forever, and forever.
    Why should I climb the look out?

    At sixteen you departed,
    You went into far Ku-to-Yen, by the river of swirling eddies,
    And you have been gone five months.
    The monkeys make sorrowful noise overhead.
    You dragged your feet when you went out.
    By the gate now, the moss is grown, the different mosses,
    Too deep to clear them away!
    The leaves fall early this autumn, in wind.
    The paired butterflies are already yellow with August
    Over the grass in the West garden,
    They hurt me,
    I grow older,
    If you are coming down through the narrows of the river Kiang,
    Please let me know beforehand,
    And I will come out to meet you,
                         As far as Cho-fu-Sa.

                                     Jewel Stairs' Grievance


    The jewelled steps are already quite white with dew,
    It is so late that the dew soaks my gauze stockings,
    And I let down the crystal curtain
    And watch the moon through the clear autumn.

                                     stairs, therefore a palace. Grievance,
    therefore there is something to complain, of. Gauze
    stockings, therefore a court lady, not a servant who
    complains. Clear autumn, therefore he has no excuse on
    account of weather. Also she has come early, for the dew
    has not merely whitened the stairs, but has soaked her
    stockings. The poem is especially prized because she utters
    no direct reproach.




    Poem by the Bridge at Ten-Shin


    March has come to the bridge head,
    Peach boughs and apricot boughs hang over a thousand gates,
    At morning there are flowers to cut the heart,
    And evening drives them on the eastward-flowing waters.
    Petals are on the gone waters and on the going,
    And on the back-swirling eddies,
    But to-days men are not the men of the old days,
    Though they hang in the same way over the bridge-rail.

    The sea's colour moves at the dawn
    And the princes still stand in rows, about the throne,
    And the moon falls over the portals of Sei-go-yo,
    And clings to the walls and the gate-top.
    With head-gear glittering against the cloud and sun,
    The lords go forth from the court, and into far borders.
    They ride upon dragon-like horses,
    Upon horses with head-trappings of yellow-metal,
    And the streets make way for their passage.
                        Haughty their passing,
    Haughty their steps as they go into great banquets,
    To high halls and curious food,
    To the perfumed air and girls dancing,
    To clear flutes and clear singing;
    To the dance of the seventy couples;
    To the mad chase through the gardens.
    Night and day are given over to pleasure
    And they think it will last a thousand autumns,
              Unwearying autumns.
    For them the yellow dogs howl portents in vain,
    And what are they compared to the lady Riokushu,
              That was cause of hate!
    Who among them is a man like Han-rei
              Who departed alone with his mistress,
    With her hair unbound, and he his own skiffs-man!

                                     of the Frontier Guard


    By the North Gate, the wind blows full of sand,
    Lonely from the beginning of time until now!
    Trees fall, the grass goes yellow with autumn.
    I climb the towers and towers
                  to watch out the barbarous land:
    Desolate castle, the sky, the wide desert.
    There is no wall left to this village.
    Bones white with a thousand frosts,
    High heaps, covered with trees and grass;
    Who brought this to pass?
    Who has brought the flaming imperial anger?
    Who has brought the army with drums and with kettle-drums?
    Barbarous kings.
    A gracious spring, turned to blood-ravenous autumn,
    A turmoil of wars-men, spread over the middle kingdom,
    Three hundred and sixty thousand,
    And sorrow, sorrow like rain.
    Sorrow to go, and sorrow, sorrow returning,
    Desolate, desolate fields,
    And no children of warfare upon them,
           No longer the men for offence and defence.
    Ah, how shall you know the dreary sorrow at the North Gate,
    With Rihoku's name forgotten,
    And we guardsmen fed to the tigers.

                                    _Rihaku._




    Exile's Letter


    To So-Kin of Rakuyo, ancient friend, Chancellor of Gen.
    Now I remember that you built me a special tavern
    By the south side of the bridge at Ten-Shin.
    With yellow gold and white jewels, we paid for songs
        and laughter
    And we were drunk for month on month, forgetting the
        kings and  princes.
    Intelligent men came drifting in from the sea and from
        the west border,
    And with them, and with you especially
    There was nothing at cross purpose,
    And they made nothing of sea-crossing or of mountain
        crossing,
    If only they could be of that fellowship,
    And we all spoke out our hearts and minds, and without
        regret.

    And then I was sent off to South Wei,
                smothered in laurel groves,
    And you to the north of Raku-hoku,
    Till we had nothing but thoughts and memories in common.

    And then, when separation had come to its worst,
    We met, and travelled into Sen-Go,
    Through all the thirty-six folds of the turning and
        twisting waters,
    Into a valley of the thousand bright flowers,
    That was the first valley;
    And into ten thousand valleys full of voices and
        pine-winds.
    And with silver harness and reins of gold,
    Out come the East of Kan foreman and his company.
    And there came also the "True man" of Shi-yo to meet me,
    Playing on a jewelled mouth-organ.
    In the storied houses of San-Ko they gave us more Sennin
        music,
    Many instruments, like the sound of young phoenix broods.
    The foreman of Kan Chu, drunk, danced
            because his long sleeves wouldn't keep still
    With that music-playing.
    And I, wrapped in brocade, went to sleep with my head on
        his lap,
    And my spirit so high it was all over the heavens,
    And before the end of the day we were scattered like stars,
        or rain.
    I had to be off to So, far away over the waters,
    You back to your river-bridge.

    And your father, who was brave as a leopard,
    Was governor in Hei Shu, and put down the barbarian rabble.
    And one May he had you send for me,
                 despite the long distance.
    And what with broken wheels and so on, I won't say it wasn't
        hard going,
    Over roads twisted like sheeps' guts.
    And I was still going, late in the year,
                 in the cutting wind from the North,
    And thinking how little you cared for the cost,
                 and you caring enough to pay it.
    And what a reception:
    Red jade cups, food well set on a blue jewelled table,
    And I was drunk, and had no thought of returning.
    And you would walk out with me to the western corner of the
        castle,
    To the dynastic temple, with water about it clear as blue jade,
    With boats floating, and the sound of mouth-organs and drums,
    With ripples like dragon-scales, going grass green on the water,
    Pleasure lasting, with courtezans, going and coming without
        hindrance,
    With the willow flakes falling like snow,
    And the vermilioned girls getting drunk about sunset,
    And the water a hundred feet deep reflecting green eyebrows
    --Eyebrows painted green are a fine sight in young moonlight,
    Gracefully painted--
    And the girls singing back at each other,
    Dancing in transparent brocade,
    And the wind lifting the song, and interrupting it,
    Tossing it up under the clouds.
                  And all this comes to an end.
                  And is not again to be met with.
    I went up to the court for examination,
    Tried Layu's luck, offered the Choyo song,
    And got no promotion,
                  and went back to the East Mountains
                      white-headed.
    And once again, later, we met at the South bridge-head.
    And then the crowd broke up, you went north to San palace,
    And if you ask how I regret that parting:
          It is like the flowers falling at Spring's end
                  Confused, whirled in a tangle.
    What is the use of talking, and there is no end of talking,
    There is no end of things in the heart.

    I call in the boy,
    Have him sit on his knees here
                 To seal this,
    And send it a thousand miles, thinking.

                                     Seafarer


    (_From the early Anglo-Saxon text_)


    May I for my own self song's truth reckon,
    Journey's jargon, how I in harsh days
    Hardship endured oft.
    Bitter breast-cares have I abided,
    Known on my keel many a care's hold,
    And dire sea-surge, and there I oft spent
    Narrow nightwatch nigh the ship's head
    While she tossed close to cliffs. Coldly afflicted,
    My feet were by frost benumbed.
    Chill its chains are; chafing sighs
    Hew my heart round and hunger begot
    Mere-weary mood. Lest man know not
    That he on dry land loveliest liveth,
    List how I, care-wretched, on ice-cold sea,
    Weathered the winter, wretched outcast
    Deprived of my kinsmen;
    Hung with hard ice-flakes, where hail-scur flew,
    There I heard naught save the harsh sea
    And ice-cold wave, at whiles the swan cries,
    Did for my games the gannet's clamour,
    Sea-fowls' loudness was for me laughter,
    The mews' singing all my mead-drink.
    Storms, on the stone-cliffs beaten, fell on the stern
    In icy feathers; full oft the eagle screamed
    With spray on his pinion.

    Not any protector
    May make merry man faring needy.
    This he little believes, who aye in winsome life
    Abides 'mid burghers some heavy business,
    Wealthy and wine-flushed, how I weary oft
    Must bide above brine.
    Neareth nightshade, snoweth from north,
    Frost froze the land, hail fell on earth then
    Corn of the coldest. Nathless there knocketh now
    The heart's thought that I on high streams
    The salt-wavy tumult traverse alone.
    Moaneth alway my mind's lust
    That I fare forth, that I afar hence
    Seek out a foreign fastness.
    For this there's no mood-lofty man over earth's midst,
    Not though he be given his good, but will have in his
        youth greed;
    Nor his deed to the daring, nor his king to the faithful
    But shall have his sorrow for sea-fare
    Whatever his lord will.
    He hath not heart for harping, nor in ring-having
    Nor winsomeness to wife, nor world's delight
    Nor any whit else save the wave's slash,
    Yet longing comes upon him to fare forth on the water.
    Bosque taketh blossom, cometh beauty of berries,
    Fields to fairness, land fares brisker,
    All this admonisheth man eager of mood,
    The heart turns to travel so that he then thinks
    On flood-ways to be far departing.
    Cuckoo calleth with gloomy crying,
    He singeth summerward, bodeth sorrow,
    The bitter heart's blood. Burgher knows not--
    He the prosperous man--what some perform
    Where wandering them widest draweth.
    So that but now my heart burst from my breast-lock,
    My mood 'mid the mere-flood,
    Over the whale's acre, would wander wide.
    On earth's shelter cometh oft to me,
    Eager and ready, the crying lone-flyer,
    Whets for the whale-path the heart irresistibly,
    O'er tracks of ocean; seeing that anyhow
    My lord deems to me this dead life
    On loan and on land, I believe not
    That any earth-weal eternal standeth
    Save there be somewhat calamitous
    That, ere a man's tide go, turn it to twain.
    Disease or oldness or sword-hate
    Beats out the breath from doom-gripped body.
    And for this, every earl whatever, for those speaking after--
    Laud of the living, boasteth some last word,
    That he will work ere he pass onward,
    Frame on the fair earth 'gainst foes his malice,
    Daring ado,...
    So that all men shall honour him after
    And his laud beyond them remain 'mid the English,
    Aye, for ever, a lasting life's-blast,
    Delight mid the doughty.
                             Days little durable,
    And all arrogance of earthen riches,
    There come now no kings nor Caesars
    Nor gold-giving lords like those gone.
    Howe'er in mirth most magnified,
    Whoe'er lived in life most lordliest,
    Drear all this excellence, delights undurable!
    Waneth the watch, but the world holdeth.
    Tomb hideth trouble.
    The blade is laid low.
    Earthly glory ageth and seareth.
    No man at all going the earth's gait,
    But age fares against him, his face paleth,
    Grey-haired he groaneth, knows gone companions,
    Lordly men are to earth o'ergiven,
    Nor may he then the flesh-cover, whose life ceaseth,
    Nor eat the sweet nor feel the sorry,
    Nor stir hand nor think in mid heart,
    And though he strew the grave with gold,
    His born brothers, their buried bodies
    Be an unlikely treasure hoard.





    _From Rihaku_



    FOUR POEMS OF DEPARTURE


    _Light rain is on the light dust._
    _The willows of the inn-yard_
    _Will be going greener and greener,_
    _But you, Sir, had better take wine ere your departure,_
    _For you will have no friends about you_
    _When you come to the gates of Go._




    Separation on the River Kiang


    Ko-jin goes west from Ko-kaku-ro,
    The smoke-flowers are blurred over the river.
    His lone sail blots the far sky.
    And now I see only the river,
                The long Kiang, reaching heaven.




    Taking Leave of a Friend


    Blue mountains to the north of the walls,
    White river winding about them;
    Here we must make separation
    And go out through a thousand miles of dead grass.

    Mind like a floating wide cloud.
    Sunset like the parting of old acquaintances
    Who bow over their clasped hands at a distance.
    Our horses neigh to each other
                 as we are departing.




    Leave-taking near Shoku


    "_Sanso, King of Shoku, built roads_"


    They say the roads of Sanso are steep,
    Sheer as the mountains.
    The walls rise in a man's face,
    Clouds grow out of the hill
                 at his horse's bridle.
    Sweet trees are on the paved way of the Shin,
    Their trunks burst through the paving,
    And freshets are bursting their ice
                 in the midst of Shoku, a proud city.

    Men's fates are already set,
    There is no need of asking diviners.




    The City of Choan


    The phoenix are at play on their terrace.
    The phoenix are gone, the river flows on alone.
    Flowers and grass
    Cover over the dark path
                 where lay the dynastic house of the Go.
    The bright cloths and bright caps of Shin
    Are now the base of old hills.

    The Three Mountains fall through the far heaven,
    The isle of White Heron
                 splits the two streams apart.
    Now the high clouds cover the sun
    And I can not see Choan afar
    And I am sad.




    South-Folk in Cold Country


    The Dai horse neighs against the bleak wind of Etsu,
    The birds of Etsu have no love for En, in the north,
    Emotion is born out of habit.
    Yesterday we went out of the Wild-Goose gate,
    To-day from the Dragon-Pen.[1]
    Surprised. Desert turmoil. Sea sun.
    Flying snow bewilders the barbarian heaven.
    Lice swarm like ants over our accoutrements.
    Mind and spirit drive on the feathery banners.
    Hard fight gets no reward.
    Loyalty is hard to explain.
    Who will be sorry for General Rishogu,
                  the swift moving,
    Whose white head is lost for this province?

[1] I.e., we have been warring from one end of the empire to
the other, now east, now west, on each border.


       *       *       *       *       *

    I have not come to the end of Ernest Fenollosa's notes by a
    long way, nor is it entirely perplexity that causes me to
    cease from translation. True, I can find little to add to
    one line out of a certain poem :

    "You know well where it was that I walked
    When you had left me."

    In another I find a perfect speech in a literality which
    will be to many most unacceptable. The couplet is as follows:

    "Drawing sword, cut into water, water again flow:
    Raise cup, quench sorrow, sorrow again sorry."

    There are also other poems, notably the "Five colour
    Screen," in which Professor Fenollosa was, as an art critic,
    especially interested, and Rihaku's sort of Ars Poetica,
    which might be given with diffidence to an audience of good
    will. But if I give them, with the necessary breaks for
    explanation, and a tedium of notes, it is quite certain that
    the personal hatred in which I am held by many, and the
    _invidia_ which is directed against me because I have dared
    openly to declare my belief in certain young artists, will
    be brought to bear first on the flaws of such translation,
    and will then be merged into depreciation of the whole book
    of translations. Therefore I give only these unquestionable
    poems.

                                                        E. P.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
When you are alone and too
tired even to turn on any of
your	devices,	you	let	yourself
linger in a past stacked
among your pillows. Usually
you are nestled under
blankets and the house is
empty. Sometimes the moon
is missing and beyond the
windows	the	low,	gray	ceiling
seems approachable. Its dark
light dims in degrees
depending on the density of
clouds	and	you	fall	back	into
that which gets reconstructed
as	metaphor.

The	route	is	often	associative.
You smell good. You are
twelve attending Sts. Philip
and James School on White
Plains Road and the girl
sitting	in	the	seat	behind	asks
you	to	lean	to	the	right	during
exams so she can copy what
you have written. Sister
Evelyn is in the habit of
taping the 100s and the
failing grades to the coat
closet doors. The girl is
Catholic with waist-length
brown hair. You can’t
remember her name: Mary?
Catherine?
You never really speak
except	for	the	time	she	makes
her request and later when
she tells you you smell good
and	have	features	more	like	a
white person. You assume
she	thinks	she	is	thanking	you
for	letting	her	cheat	and	feels
better cheating from an
almost	white	person.Sister Evelyn never figures
out	your	arrangement	perhaps
because you never turn
around to copy Mary
Catherine’s answers. Sister
Evelyn must think these two
girls think a lot alike or she
cares less about cheating and
more	about	humiliation	or	she
never	actually	saw	you	sitting
there.

Certain	
moments	
send
adrenaline to the heart, dry
out the tongue, and clog the
lungs. Like thunder they
drown you in sound, no, like
lightning they strike you
across the larynx. Cough.
After it happened I was at a
loss for words. Haven’t you
said this yourself? Haven’t
you	said	this	to	a	close	friend
who early in your friendship,
when distracted, would call
you	by	the	name	of	her	black
housekeeper? You assumed
you two were the only black
people in her life. Eventually
she stopped doing this,
though	
she	
never
acknowledged her slippage.

And you never called her on
it (why not?) and yet, you
don’t forget. If this were a
domestic tragedy, and it
might well be, this would be
your	
fatal	
flaw—yourmemory, vessel of your
feelings. Do you feel hurt
because it’s the “all black
people look the same”
moment, or because you are
being confused with another
after being so close to this
other?An unsettled feeling keeps
the body front and center.

The wrong words enter your
day like a bad egg in your
mouth and puke runs down
your blouse, a dampness
drawing your stomach in
toward your rib cage. When
you look around only you
remain. Your own disgust at
what you smell, what you
feel, doesn’t bring you to
your feet, not right away,
because gathering energy has
become	its	own	task,	needing
its own argument. You are
reminded of a conversation
you had recently, comparing
the merits of sentences
constructed implicitly with
“yes, and” rather than “yes,
but.” You and your friend
decided that “yes, and”
attested	to	a	life	with	no	turn-
off,	no	alternative	routes:	you
pull yourself to standing,
soon enough the blouse is
rinsed, it’s another week, the
blouse is beneath your
sweater, against your skin,
and	you	smell	good.

The rain this morning pours
from the gutters and
everywhere else it is lost in
the trees. You need your
glasses	to	single	out	what	you
know is there because doubt
is	inexorable;	you	put	on	your
glasses. The trees, their bark,
their leaves, even the dead
ones, are more vibrant wet.
Yes, and it’s raining. Each
moment	is	like	this—before	it
can	be	known,	categorized	as
similar to another thing and
dismissed, it has to be
experienced,	it	has	to	be	seen.

What	did	he	just	say?	Did	she
really	just	say	that?	Did	I	hear
what	I	think	I	heard?	Did	that
just come out of my mouth,
his mouth, your mouth? The
moment	stinks.	Still	you	want
to stop looking at the trees.
You want to walk out and
stand among them. And as
light	as	the	rain	seems,	it	still
rains	down	on	you.

You are in the dark, in the
car,	watching	the	black-tarred
street being swallowed by
speed;	he	tells	you	his	dean	is
making him hire a person of
color	when	there	are	so	many
great	writers	out	there.
You think maybe this is an
experiment	and	you	are	being
tested	
or	
retroactivelyinsulted or you have done
something	that	communicates
this is an okay conversation
to	be	having.
Why	do	you	feel	comfortable
saying this to me? You wish
the light would turn red or a
police siren would go off so
you	could	slam	on	the	brakes,
slam into the car ahead of
you, fly forward so quickly
both your faces would
suddenly be exposed to the
wind.

As usual you drive straight
through the moment with the
expected	backing	off	of	what
was previously said. It is not
only that confrontation is
headache-producing;	it	is	also
that you have a destination
that doesn’t include acting
like this moment isn’t
inhabitable, hasn’t happened
before, and the before isn’t
part of the now as the night
darkens	and	the	time	shortens
between where we are and
where	we	are	going.

When you arrive in your
driveway	and	turn	off	the	car,
you remain behind the wheel
another	ten	minutes.	You	fear
the night is being locked in
and coded on a cellular level
and	want	time	to	function	as	a
power wash. Sitting there
staring at the closed garage
door you are reminded that a
friend once told you there
exists the medical term
for people
exposed	to	stresses	stemming
from racism. They achieve
themselves to death trying to
dodge	the	buildup	of	erasure.
Sherman

sometimes your historical
selves, her white self and
your	black	self,	or	your	white

standing at his window

guy casing both your homes.
The guy is walking back and
forth talking to himself and
seems	disturbed.
You tell your neighbor that
your friend, whom he has
met, is babysitting. He says,
no, it’s not him. He’s met
your	friend	and	this	isn’t	that
nice	young	man.	Anyway,	he
wants you to know, he’s
called	the	police.
Your	partner	calls	your	friend
and	asks	him	if	there’s	a	guy

outside. You hear the sirens

Your friend is speaking to
your neighbor when you
arrive home. The four police
cars are gone. Your neighbor
has	apologized	to	your	friend
and is now apologizing to
you. Feeling somewhat
responsible for the actions of
your neighbor, you clumsily
tell your friend that the next
time he wants to talk on the
phone	he	should	just	go	in	the
backyard. He looks at you a
long	minute	before	saying	he
can speak on the phone

Hennessy Youngman aka
Jayson Musson, whose Art
Thoughtz take the form of
tutorials	
on	
YouTube,
educates	
viewers	
on
contemporary art issues. In
one of his many videos, he
addresses how to become a
successful black artist, wryly
suggesting black people’s
anger is marketable. He
advises black artists to
cultivate “an angry nigger
exterior”	by	watching,	among
other	things,	the	Rodney	King
video	while	working.

Youngman’s suggestions are
meant to expose expectations
for blackness as well as to
underscore the difficulty
inherent in any attempt by
black artists to metabolize
real rage. The commodified
anger his video advocates
rests	lightly	on	the	surface	for
spectacle’s sake. It can be
engaged or played like the
race	card	and	is	tied	solely	to
the performance of blackness
and	not	to	the	emotional	state
of particular individuals in
particular	situations.

On the bridge between this
sellable	anger	and	“the	artist”
resides, at times, an actual
anger.	Youngman	in	his	video
doesn’t address this type of
anger: the anger built up
through experience and the
quotidian struggles against
dehumanization every brown
or black person lives simply
because of skin color. This
other kind of anger in time
can prevent, rather than
sponsor, the production of
anything	except	loneliness.
You begin to think, maybe
erroneously, that this other
kind of anger is really a type
of knowledge: the type that
both	clarifies	and	disappoints.
It responds to insult and
attempted erasure simply by
asserting presence, and the
energy	required	to	present,	to
react,	
to	
assert	
is
accompanied by visceral
disappointment:	
a
disappointment in the sense
that no amount of visibility
will alter the ways in which
one	is	perceived.
Recognition of this lack
might break you apart. Or
recognition might illuminate
the erasure the attempted
erasure triggers. Whether
such discerning creates a
healthier, if more isolated,
self, you can’t know. In any
case, Youngman doesn’t
speak to this kind of anger.
He doesn’t say that
witnessing the expression of
this more ordinary and daily
anger	might	make	the	witness
believe that a person is
“insane.”And	insane	is	what	you	think,
one	
Sunday	
afternoon,
drinking an Arnold Palmer,
watching the 2009 Women’s
US	Open	final,	when	brought
to full attention by the
suddenly explosive behavior
of	Serena	Williams.	Serena	in
HD before your eyes
becomes overcome by a rage
you recognize and have been
taught to hold at a distance
for your own good. Serena’s
behavior, on this particular
Sunday afternoon, suggests
that all the injustice she has
played through all the years
of her illustrious career
flashes before her and she
decides finally to respond to
all of it with a string of
invectives. Nothing, not even
the repetition of negations
(“no, no, no”) she employed
in a similar situation years
before	as	a	younger	player	at
the 2004 US Open, prepares
you for this. Oh my God,
she’s gone crazy, you say to
no	one.
What does a victorious or
defeated	black	woman’s	body
in a historically white space
look	like?	Serena	and	her	big
sister	
Venus	
Williams
brought to mind Zora Neale
Hurston’s “I feel most
colored when I am thrown
against a sharp white
background.”	
Thisappropriated line, stenciled
on canvas by Glenn Ligon,
who used plastic letter
stencils, smudging oil sticks,
and graphite to transform the
words into abstractions,
seemed to be ad copy for
some aspect of life for all
black	bodies.
Hurston’s statement has been
played out on the big screen
by Serena and Venus: they
win sometimes, they lose
sometimes, they’ve been
injured, they’ve been happy,
they’ve been sad, ignored,
booed mightily (see Indian
Wells, which both sisters
have boycotted since 2001),
they’ve been cheered, and
through it all and evident to
all	were	those	people	who	are
enraged	they	are	there	at	all—
graphite	against	a	sharp	white
background.For years you attribute to
Serena Williams a kind of
resilience	appropriate	only	for
those who exist in celluloid.
Neither her father nor her
mother nor her sister nor
Jehovah her God nor NIKE
camp could shield her
ultimately from people who
felt her black body didn’t
belong	on	their	court,	in	their
world. From the start many
made it clear Serena would
have	done	better	struggling	tosurvive	
in	
the	
two-
dimensionality of a Millet
painting, rather than on their
tennis	court—better	to	put	all
that strength to work in their
fantasy of her working the
land,	rather	than	be	caught	up
in the turbulence of our
ancient dramas, like a ship
fighting a storm in a Turner
seascape.
The	
most	
notorious	
ofSerena’s detractors takes the
form of Mariana Alves, the
distinguished tennis chair
umpire. In 2004 Alves was
excused from officiating any
more	matches	on	the	final	day
of the US Open after she
made five bad calls against
Serena in her semifinal
matchup against fellow
American Jennifer Capriati.
The serves and returns Alves
called out were landing,
stunningly un returned by
Capriati, inside the lines, no
discerning eyesight needed.
Commentators, spectators,
television viewers, line
judges, everyone could see
the balls were good,
everyone, apparently, except
Alves. No one could
understand	
what	
was
happening. Serena, in her
denim skirt, black sneaker
boots, and dark mascara,
began	wagging	her	finger	and
saying “no, no, no,” as if by
negating the moment she
could propel us back into a
legible	
world.	
Tennis
superstar John McEnroe,
given his own keen eye for
injustice	
during	
his
professional career, was
shocked	that	Serena	was	able
to	hold	it	together	after	losing
the	match.
Though no one was saying
anything explicitly about
Serena’s black body, you are
not the only viewer who
thought it was getting in the
way of Alves’s sight line.
One commentator said he
hoped	he	wasn’t	being	unkind
when he stated, “Capriati
wins it with the help of the
umpires	and	the	lines	judges.”
A	year	later	that	match	would
be	credited	for	demonstrating
the need for the speedy
installation	of	Hawk-Eye,	the
line-calling technology that
took	the	seeing	away	from	the
beholder. Now the umpire’s
call can be challenged by a
replay; however, back then
after the match Serena said,
“I’m very angry and bitter
right now. I felt cheated.
Shall I go on? I just feel
robbed.”
And though you felt outrage
for	Serena	after	that	2004	US
Open,	as	the	years	go	by,	she
seems to put Alves, and a
lengthening list of other
curious calls and oversights,
against both her and her
sister, behind her as they
happen.
Yes, and the body has
memory.	
The	
physical
carriage hauls more than its
weight. The body is the
threshold across which each
objectionable call passes into
consciousness—all	
the
unintimidated, unblinking,
and unflappable resilience
does not erase the moments
lived	through,	even	as	we	are
eternally	
stupid	
or
everlastingly optimistic, so
ready to be inside, among, a
part	of	the	games.
And	here	Serena	is,	five	years
after Alves, back at the US
Open, again in a semifinal
match, this time against
Belgium’s Kim Clijsters.
Serena	is	not	playing	well	and
loses	the	first	set.	In	response
she	smashes	her	racket	on	the
court. Now McEnroe isn’t
stunned	by	her	ability	to	hold
herself	together	and	is	moved
to say, “That’s as angry as
I’ve ever seen her.” The
umpire gives her a warning;
another	violation	will	mean	a
point	penalty.She	is	in	the	second	set	at	the
critical moment of 5–6 in
Clijsters’s favor, serving to
stay in the match, at match
point. The line judge
employed	by	the	US	Open	to
watch Serena’s body, its
every move, says Serena
stepped on the line while
serving. What? (The Hawk-
Eye cameras don’t cover the
feet,	
only	
the	
ball,
apparently.) What! Are you
serious? She is serious; she
has seen a foot fault, one no
one else is able to locate
despite	the	numerous	replays.
“No	foot	fault,	you	definitely
do	not	see	a	foot	fault	there,”
says McEnroe. “That’s
overofficiating for certain,”
says another commentator.
Even the ESPN tennis
commentator, who seems
predictable	in	her	readiness	to
find fault with the Williams
sisters, says, “Her foot fault
call was way off.” Yes, and
even if there had been a foot
fault, despite the rule, they
are rarely ever called at
critical moments in a Grand
Slam match because “You
don’t make a call,” tennis
official	Carol	Cox	says,	“that
can	decide	a	match	unless	it’s
flagrant.”
As you look at the affable
Kim Clijsters, you try to
entertain	the	thought	that	this
scenario could have played
itself out the other way. And
as Serena turns to the
lineswoman and says, “I
swear to God I’m fucking
going	to	take	this	fucking	ball
and shove it down your
fucking	throat,	you	hear	that?
I	swear	to	God!”	As	offensive
as her outburst is, it is
difficult not to applaud her
for reacting immediately to
being thrown against a sharp
white background. It is
difficult not to applaud her
for existing in the moment,
for fighting crazily against
the so-called wrongness of
her body’s positioning at the
service	line.
She says in 2009, belatedly,
the words that should have
been said to the umpire in
2004, the words that might
have	snapped	Alves	back	into
focus, a focus that would
have acknowledged what
actually was happening on
the court. Now Serena’s
reaction is read as insane.
And her punishment for this
moment of manumission is
the threatened point penalty
resulting in the loss of the
match,	an	$82,500	fine,	plus	a
two-year probationary period
by	
the	
Grand	
Slam
Committee.Perhaps the committee’s
decision is only about
context,	though	context	is	not
meaning. It is a public event
being watched in homes
across	the	world.	In	any	case,
it	is	difficult	not	to	think	that
if Serena lost context by
abandoning all rules of
civility, it could be because
her body, trapped in a racial
imaginary,	
trapped	
in
disbelief—code for being
black in America—is being
governed not by the tennis
match she is participating in
but	
by	
a	
collapsed
relationship	
that	
had
promised	to	play	by	the	rules.
Perhaps this is how racism
feels no matter the context—
randomly the rules everyone
else	gets	to	play	by	no	longer
apply to you, and to call this
out	by	calling	out	“

I	swear	to
God!” is to be called insane,
crass,	
crazy.	
Bad
sportsmanship.

Two years later, September
11, 2011, Serena is playing
the Australian Sam Stosur in
the US Open final. She is
expected to win, having just
beaten the number-one
player, the Dane Caroline
Wozniacki, in the semifinal
the night before. Some
speculate Serena especially
wants	to	win	this	Grand	Slam
because it is the tenth
anniversary of the attack on
the Twin Towers. It’s
believed that by winning she
will prove her red-blooded
American patriotism and will
once and for all become
beloved by the tennis world
(think Arthur Ashe after his
death). All the bad calls, the
boos, the criticisms that she
has made ugly the game of
tennis—through her looks as
well as her behavior—that
entire	cluster	of	betrayals	will
be	wiped	clean	with	this	win.

One imagines her wanting to
say	what	her	sister	would	say
a year later after being
diagnosed with Sjögren’s
syndrome and losing her
match	to	shouts	of	“Let’s	go,
Venus!” in Arthur Ashe
Stadium: “I know this is not
proper tennis etiquette, but
this	is	the	first	time	I’ve	ever
played here that the crowd
has	been	behind	me	like	that.
Today I felt American, you
know,	for	the	first	time	at	the
US Open. So I’ve waited my
whole career to have this
moment	and	here	it	is.”
It is all too exhausting and
Serena’s	exhaustion	shows	in
her playing; she is losing, a
set and a game down. Yes,
and finally she hits a great
shot, a big forehand, and
before the ball is safely past
Sam Stosur’s hitting zone,
Serena yells, “Come on!”
thinking she has hit an
irretrievable winner. The
umpire, Eva Asderaki, rules
correctly that Serena, by
shouting, interfered with
Stosur’s	
concentration.

Subsequently, a ball that
Stosur seemingly would not
have been able to return
becomes Stosur’s point.
Serena’s reply is to ask the
umpire if she is trying to
screw her again. She
remembers the umpire doing
this to her before. As a
viewer, you too, along with
John McEnroe, begin to
wonder if this is the same
umpire	from	2004	or	2009.	It
isn’t—in	2004	it	was	Mariana
Alves and in 2009 it was
Sharon Wright; however, the
use of the word “again” by
Serena	returns	her	viewers	to
other times calling her body
out.Again Serena’s frustrations,
her disappointments, exist
within a system you
understand not to try to
understand	in	any	fair-minded
way because to do so is to
understand the erasure of the
self as systemic, as ordinary.
For Serena, the daily
diminishment is a low flame,
a constant drip. Every look,
every comment, every bad
call blossoms out of history,
through her, onto you. To

understand	is	to	see	Serena	as
hemmed	in	as	any	other	black
body thrown against our
American	
background.
“Aren’t you the one that
screwed me over last time
here?” she asks umpire
Asderaki. “Yeah, you are.
Don’t look at me. Really,
don’t even look at me. Don’t
look	my	way.	Don’t	look	my
way,” she repeats, because it
is	that	simple.

Yes,	and	who	can	turn	away?
Serena is not running out of
breath. Despite all her
understanding, she continues
to serve up aces while
smashing rackets and fraying
hems. In the 2012 Olympics
she brought home the only
two gold medals the
Americans would win in
tennis.	After	her	three-second
celebratory dance on center
court	at	the	All	England	Club,
the	American	media	reported,“


And there was Serena ...
Crip-Walking all over the
most lily-white place in the
world.... You couldn’t help
but	shake	your	head....	What
Serena did was akin to
cracking a tasteless, X-rated
joke	inside	a	church....	What
she did was immature and
classless.”

Before	making	the	video	How
to Be a Successful Black
Artist, Hennessy Youngman
uploaded	to	YouTube	How	to
Be a Successful Artist.	While
putting forward the argument
that one needs to be white to
be truly successful, he adds,
in	an	aside,	that	this	might	not
work	for	blacks	because	if	“a
nigger paints a flower it
becomes a slavery flower,
flower de Amistad,” thereby
intimating	
that	
any
relationship between the
white viewer and the black
artist immediately becomes
one between white persons
and black property, which
was the legal state of things
once upon a time, as Patricia
Williams has pointed out in
The Alchemy of Race and
Rights: “The cold game of
equality staring makes me
feel like a thin sheet of
glass.... I could force my
presence, the real me
contained	in	those	eyes,	upon
them,	but	I	would	be	smashed
in	the	process.”

Interviewed by the Brit Piers
Morgan after her 2012
Olympic victory, Serena is
informed by Morgan that he
was planning on calling her
victory dance “the Serena
Shuffle”; however, he has
learned from the American
press	that	it	is	a	Crip	Walk,	a
gangster dance. Serena
responds incredulously by
asking if she looks like a
gangster to him. Yes, he
answers. All in a day’s fun,
perhaps, and in spite and
despite	it	all,	Serena	Williams
blossoms again into Serena
Williams. When asked if she
is confident she can win her
upcoming matches, her
answer remains, “At the end
of the day, I am very happy
with me and I’m very happy
with	my	results.”
Serena would go on to win
every match she played
between	the	US	Open	and	the
year-end 2012 championship
tournament, and because
tennis is a game of
adjustments, she would do
this	without	any	reaction	to	a
number	of	questionable	calls.

More than one commentator
would remark on her ability
to hold it together during
these matches. She is a
woman	in	love,	one	suggests.
She has grown up, another
decides, as if responding to
the injustice of racism is
childish and her previous
demonstration of emotion
was	
free-floating	
and
detached from any external
actions by others. Some
others theorize she is
developing the admirable
“calm	and	measured	logic”	of
an Arthur Ashe, who the
sportswriter Bruce Jenkins
felt was “dignified” and
“courageous”	in	his	ability	to
confront injustice without
making a scene. Jenkins,
perhaps inspired by Serena’s
new	comportment,	felt	moved
to argue that her continued
boycott of Indian Wells in
2013, where she felt
traumatized	by	the	aggression
of	racist	slurs	hurled	at	her	in
2001, was lacking in
“dignity” and “integrity” and
demonstrated	
“only
stubbornness	and	a	grudge.”

Watching	
this	
newly
contained Serena, you begin
to wonder if she finally has
given	up	wanting	better	from
her peers or if she too has
come across Hennessy’s Art
Thoughtz and is channeling
his	assertion	that	the	less	that
is communicated the better.
Be ambiguous. This type of
ambiguity could also be
diagnosed	as	dissociation	and
would	support	Serena’s	claim
that she has had to split
herself off from herself and
create	different	personae.
Now that there is no calling
out	of	injustice,	no	yelling,	no
cursing,	no	finger	wagging	or
head shaking, the media
decides	to	take	up	the	mantle
when	on	December	12,	2012,
two weeks after Serena is
named WTA Player of the
Year, the Dane Caroline
Wozniacki,	a	former	number-
one	player,	imitates	Serena	by
stuffing	towels	in	her	top	and
shorts, all in good fun, at an
exhibition match. Racist?
CNN wants to know if
outrage is the proper
response.It’s then that Hennessy’s
suggestions	about	“how	to	be
a successful artist” return to
you:	be	ambiguous,	be	white.
Wozniacki, it becomes clear,
has finally enacted what was
desired by many of Serena’s
detractors, consciously or
unconsciously, the moment
the	Compton	girl	first	stepped
on court. Wozniacki (though
there	are	a	number	of	ways	to
interpret her actions—playful
mocking of a peer, imitation
of	the	mimicking	antics	of	the
tennis player known as the
joker, Novak Djokovic)
finally gives the people what
they	have	wanted	all	along	by
embodying	
Serena’s
attributes while leaving
Serena’s “angry nigger
exterior” behind. At last, in
this	real,	and	unreal,	moment,
we have Wozniacki’s image
of smiling blond goodness
posing as the best female
tennis	player	of	all	time.

previous
understandings,	
suddenly
incoherence feels violent.

You	both	experience	this	cut,
which	she	keeps	insisting	is	a
joke, a joke stuck in her
throat, and like any other
injury, you watch it rupture
along its suddenly exposed
suture.When a woman you work
with	calls	you	by	the	name	of
another woman you work
with, it is too much of a
cliché not to laugh out loud
with the friend beside you
who says, oh no she didn’t.
Still,	in	the	end,	so	what,	who
cares? She had a fifty-fifty
chance	of	getting	it	right.


Yes, and in your mail the
apology	
note	
appears
referring to “our mistake.”
Apparently	
your	
own
invisibility	is	the	real	problem
causing	her	confusion.	This	is
how	the	apparatus	she	propels
you	into	begins	to	multiply	its
meaning.
What	did	you	say?


At the end of a brief phone
conversation, you tell the
manager you are speaking
with that you will come by
his office to sign the form.
When you arrive and
announce yourself, he blurts
out, I didn’t know you were
black!
I didn’t mean to say that, he
then	says.
Aloud,	you	say.
What?	he	asks.
You didn’t mean to say that
aloud.
Your	transaction	goes	swiftly
after	that.

And when the woman with
the multiple degrees says, I
didn’t know black women
could	get	cancer,	instinctively
you take two steps back
though	all	urgency	leaves	the
possibility of any kind of
relationship as you realize
nowhere	is	where	you	will	get
from	here.

A	friend	tells	you	he	has	seen
a photograph of you on the
Internet	and	he	wants	to	know
why you look so angry. You
and the photographer chose
the photograph he refers to
because you both decided it
looked the most relaxed. Do
you look angry? You
wouldn’t have said so.
Obviously this unsmiling
image of you makes him
uncomfortable, and he needs
you	to	account	for	that.
If you were smiling, what
would that tell him about
your composure in his
imagination?

Despite	the	fact	that	you	have
the same sabbatical schedule
as	everyone	else,	he	says,	you
are	always	on	sabbatical.	You
are friends so you respond,
easy.
What	do	you	mean?
Exactly,	what	do	you	mean?

Someone	in	the	audience	asks
the man promoting his new
book on humor what makes
something funny. His answer
is what you expect—context.
After a pause he adds that if
someone	said	something,	like
about	someone,	and	you	were
with your friends you would
probably laugh, but if they
said it out in public where
black	people	could	hear	what
was said, you might not,
probably would not. Only
then do you realize you are
among “the others out in
public” and not among
“friends.”Not long ago you are in a
room	where	someone	asks	the
philosopher Judith Butler
what	makes	language	hurtful.
You can feel everyone lean
in.	Our	very	being	exposes	us
to	the	address	of	another,	she
answers. We suffer from the
condition	
of	
being
addressable. Our emotional
openness,	she	adds,	is	carried
by	
our	
addressability.

Language	navigates	this.
For so long you thought the
ambition of racist language
was to denigrate and erase
you as a person. After
considering	Butler’s	remarks,
you begin to understand
yourself	
as	
rendered
hypervisible in the face of
such	language	acts.	Language
that feels hurtful is intended
to exploit all the ways thatyou are present. Your
alertness, your openness, and
your	desire	to	engage	actually
demand your presence, your
looking	up,	your	talking	back,
and,	as	insane	as	it	is,	saying
please.Standing	
outside	
the
conference room, unseen by
the two men waiting for the
others	to	arrive,	you	hear	one
say to the other that being
around black people is like
watching a foreign film
without translation. Because
you will spend the next two
hours around the round table
that	makes	conversing	easier,
you consider waiting a few
minutes before entering the
room.The real estate woman, who
didn’t	fathom	she	could	have
made	an	appointment	to	show
her house to you, spends
much of the walk-through
telling	
your	
friend,
repeatedly, how comfortable
she feels around her. Neither
you	nor	your	friend	bothers	to
ask who is making her feel
uncomfortable.The man at the cash register
wants to know if you think
your	card	will	work.	


If	this	is
his	routine,	he	didn’t	use	it	on
the friend who went before
you.	As	she	picks	up	her	bag,
she	looks	to	see	what	you	will
say. She says nothing. You
want her to say something—
both as witness and as a
friend. She is not you; her
silence says so. Because you
are watching all this take
place even as you participate
in	it,	you	say	nothing	as	well.
Come over here with me,
your eyes say. Why on earth
would she? The man behind
the register returns your card
and places the sandwich and
Pellegrino in a bag, which
you take from the counter.
What is wrong with you?
This question gets stuck in
your	dreams.

Another friend tells you you
have to learn not to absorb
the world. She says
sometimes she can hear her
own voice saying silently to
whomever—you are saying
this	thing	and	I	am	not	going
to accept it. Your friend
refuses to carry what doesn’t
belong	to	her.

You take in things you don’t
want	all	the	time.	The	second
you	hear	or	see	some	ordinary
moment, all its intended
targets, all the meanings
behind	the	retreating	seconds,
as far as you are able to see,
come	into	focus.	Hold	up,	did
you just hear, did you just
say,	did	you	just	see,	did	you
just do that? Then the voice
in	your	head	silently	tells	you
to take your foot off your
throat because just getting
along shouldn’t	
ambition.


To live through the days
sometimes you moan like
deer. Sometimes you sigh.
The world says stop that.
Another sigh. Another stop
that.	Moaning	elicits	laughter,
sighing upsets. Perhaps each
sigh is drawn into existence
to pull in, pull under, who
knows; truth be told, you
could no more control those
sighs than that which brings
the	sighs	about.

The sigh is the pathway to
breath; it allows breathing.
That’s just self-preservation.
No one fabricates that. You
sit	down,	you	sigh.	You	stand
up,	you	sigh.	The	sighing	is	a
worrying exhale of an ache.
You wouldn’t call it an
illness; still it is not the
iteration	of	a	free	being.	What
else to liken yourself to but
an	animal,	the	ruminant	kind?
You like to think memory
goes far back though
remembering was never
recommended.	Forget	all	that,
the world says. The world’s
had a lot of practice. No one
should	adhere	to	the	facts	that
contribute to narrative, the
facts that create lives. To
your mind, feelings are what
create a person, something
unwilling, something wild
vandalizing whatever the
skull holds. Those sensations
form a someone. The
headaches begin then. Don’t
wear	sunglasses	in	the	house,
the world says, though they
soothe, soothe sight, soothe
you.The head’s ache evaporates
into a state of numbness, a
cave of sighs. Over the years
you lose the melodrama of
seeing yourself as a patient.
The sighing ceases; the
headaches remain. You hold
your	head	in	your	hands.	You
sit still. Rarely do you lie
down.	You	ask	yourself,	how
can I help you? A glass of
water? Sunglasses? The
enteric-coated tablets live in
your purse next to your
license. The sole action is to
turn on tennis matches
without the sound. Yes, and
though	watching	tennis	isn’t	a
cure for feeling, it is a clean
displacement of effort, will,
and	disappointment.The world is wrong. You
can’t	put	the	past	behind	you.
It’s buried in you; it’s turned
your flesh into its own
cupboard. Not everything
remembered is useful but it
all comes from the world to
be stored in you. Who did
what	to	whom	on	which	day?
Who said that? She said
what? What did he just do?
Did she really just say that?
He said what? What did she
do?	Did	I	hear	what	I	think	I
heard?	Did	that	just	come	out
of	my	mouth,	his	mouth,	your
mouth? Do you remember
when	you	sighed?Memory is a tough place.
You	were	there.	If	this	is	not
the truth, it is also not a lie.
There are benefits to being
without nostalgia. Certainly
nostalgia and being without
nostalgia relieve the past.
Sitting here, there are no
memories to remember, just
the	ball	going	back	and	forth.
Shored up by this external
net,	the	problem	is	not	one	of
a lack of memories; the
problem is simply a lack, a
lack	before,	during,	and	after.
The chin and your cheek fit
into the palm of your hand.
Feeling better? The ball isn’t
being returned. Someone is
approaching the umpire.
Someone	is	upset	now.

You fumble around for the
remote to cancel mute. The
player	says	something	and	the
formerly professional umpire
looks down from her high
chair as if regarding an
unreasonable child, a small
animal. The commentator
wonders if the player will be
able	to	put	this	incident	aside.
No one can get behind the
feeling	that	caused	a	pause	in
the	match,	not	even	the	player
trying to put her feelings
behind her, dumping ball
after	ball	into	the	net.	Though
you	can	retire	with	an	injury,
you	can’t	walk	away	because
you	feel	bad.Feel good. Feel better. Move
forward. Let it go. Come on.
Come on. Come on. In due
time the ball is going back
and forth over the net. Now
the	sound	can	be	turned	back
down. Your fingers cover
your eyes, press them deep
into their sockets—too much
commotion, too much for a
head remembering to ache.
Move	on.	Let	it	go.	Come	on.

Words work as release—
well-oiled doors opening and
closing between intention,
gesture.	A	pulse	in	a	neck,	the
shiftiness of the hands, an
unconscious	
blink,	
the
conversations you have with
your	eyes	translate	everything
and nothing. What will be
needed, what goes unfelt,
unsaid—what has been
duplicated, redacted here,
redacted	there,	altered	to	hide
or disguise—words encoding
the bodies they cover. And
despite everything the body
remains.

Occasionally it is interesting
to think about the outburst if
you	would	just	cry	out—
To know what you’ll sound
like	is	worth	noting—

In the darkened moment a
body given blue light, a
flashlight, enters with levity,
with or without assumptions,
doubts, with desire, the
beating	
heart,
disappointment, with desires
—
Stand	where	you	are.

You	begin	to	move	around	in
search	of	the	steps	it	will	take
before you are thrown back
into	your	own	body,	back	into
your	own	need	to	be	found.
The destination is illusory.
You raise your lids. No one
else	is	seeking.
You	exhaust	yourself	looking
into the blue light. All day
blue	burrows	the	atmosphere.

What doesn’t belong with
you	won’t	be	seen.
You could build a world out
of need or you could hold
everything black and see.
You	give	back	the	lack.
You hold everything black.
You give yourself back until
nothing’s left but the
dissolving	blues	of	metaphor.

Sometimes	“I”	is	supposed	to
hold	what	is	not	there	until	it
is. Then what is comes apart
the	closer	you	are	to	it.
This makes the first person a
symbol	for	something.
The pronoun barely holding
the	person	together.

Someone claimed we should
use our skin as wallpaper
knowing	we	couldn’t	win.
You said “I” has so much
power;	it’s	insane.
And	you	would	look	past	me,
all gloved up, in a big coat,
with fancy fur around the
collar, and record a self
saying,	you	should	be	scared,
the	first	person	can’t	pull	you
together.

Shit, you are reading minds,
but	did	you	try?
Tried	rhyme,	tried	truth,	tried
epistolary untruth, tried and
tried.
You really did. Everyoneunderstood you to be
suffering and still everyone
thought	you	thought	you	were
the sun—never mind our
unlikeness, you too have
heard	the	noise	in	your	voice.
Anyway, sit down. Sit here
alongside.Exactly why we survive and
can look back with furrowed
brow	is	beyond	me.
It	is	not	something	to	know.
Your	ill-spirited,	cooked,	hell
on Main Street, nobody’s
here, broken-down, first
person	could	be	one	of	many
definitions of being to pass
on.

The past is a life sentence, a
blunt instrument aimed at
tomorrow.
Drag that first person out of
the social death of history,
then	we’re	kin.

Kin	calling	out	the	past	like	a
foreigner with a newly
minted	“fuck	you.”
Maybe	you	don’t	agree.
Maybe	you	don’t	think	so.
Maybe you are right, you
don’t really have anything to
confess.Why	are	you	standing?


Listen, you, I was creating a
life study of a monumental
first person, a Brahmin first
person.
If	you	need	to	feel	that	way—
still you are in here and here
is	nowhere.
Join me down here in
nowhere.

Don’t lean against the
wallpaper; sit down and pull
together.
Yours is a strange dream, a
strange	reverie.
No,	it’s	a	strange	beach;	each
body is a strange beach, and
if you let in the excess
emotion you will recall the
Atlantic Ocean breaking on
our	heads.Yesterday called to say we
were together and you were
bloodshot and again the day
carried you across a field of
hours, deep into dawn, back
to now, where you are
thankful	for
what faces you, the storm,
this day’s sigh as the day
shifts its leaves, the wind, a
prompt against the calm you
can’t	digest.

Blue ceiling calling a body
into the midst of azure,
oceanic,	as	ocean	blushes	the
blues it can’t absorb,
reflecting	back	a	day
the	day	frays,	night,	not	night,
this fright passes through the
eye crashing into you, is this
you?

Yes, it’s me, clear the way,
then	hold	me	clear	of	this	that
faces, the storm carrying me
through	dawn
not	knowing	whether	to	climb
down	or	up	into	its	eye—day,
hearing a breath shiver,
whose	are	you?Guard rail, spotlight, safety
lock, airbag, fire lane, slip
guard, night watch, far into
this	day	are	the	days	this	day
was meant to take out of its
way.	An	obstacle
to surrender, dusk in dawn,
held open, then closing, then
opening, a red-tailed hawk,
dusk at dawn, taking over
blue, surveying movement,
against the calm, red sky at
morning,
whose	are	you?

In line at the drugstore it’s
finally	your	turn,	and	then	it’s
not as he walks in front of
you	and	puts	his	things	on	the
counter.	The	cashier	says,	Sir,
she was next. When he turns
to	you	he	is	truly	surprised.
Oh	my	God,	I	didn’t	see	you.

You must be in a hurry, you
offer.
No,	no,	no,	I	really	didn’t	see
you.You wait at the bar of the
restaurant for a friend, and a
man, wanting to make
conversation,	
nursing
something, takes out his
phone to show you a picture
of his wife. You say, bridge
that she is, that she is
beautiful. She is, he says,
beautiful	and	black,	like	you.

Leaving	the	day	to	itself,	you
close	the	door	behind	you	and
pour a bowl of cereal, then
another, and would a third if
you didn’t interrupt yourself
with the statement—you
aren’t	hungry.
Appetite won’t attach you to
anything no matter how
depleted	you	feel.It’s	true.
You lean against the sink, a
glass of red wine in your
hand and then another,
thinking in the morning you
will go to the gym having
slept and slept beyond the
residuals	of	all	yesterdays.
Yes, and you do go to the
gym and run in place, an
entire hour running, just you
and
your body running off each
undesired	desired	encounter.


Hours later, still in the
difficulty of what it is to be,
just like that, inside it,
standing	
there,	
maybe
wading, maybe waving,
standing where the deep
waters of everything backed
up, one said, climbing over
bodies, one said, stranded on
a roof, one said, trapped in
the building, and in the
difficulty, nobody coming
and	still	someone	saying,	who
could see it coming, the
difficulty	of	that.
The fiction of the facts
assumes	
innocence,
ignorance, lack of intention,
misdirection; the necessary
conditions of a certain time
and	place.
Have	you	seen	their	faces?

Faith, not fear, she said.
She’d heard that once and
was trying to stamp the
phrase on her mind. At the
time, she couldn’t speak it
aloud.	He	wouldn’t	tolerate	it.
He was angry. Where were
they? Where was anyone?
This	
is	
a	
goddamn
emergency,	he	said.

Then someone else said it
was the classic binary
between the rich and the
poor, between the haves and
the have-nots, between the
whites and the blacks, in the
difficulty	of	all	that.

Then each house was a
mumbling structure, all that
water, buildings peeling
apart, the yellow foam, the
contaminated	
drawl	
of
mildew,	mold.
The missing limbs, he said,
the bodies lodged in piles of
rubble,	dangling	from	rafters,
lying	
facedown,	
armsoutstretched	on	parlor	floors.

And someone said, where
were the buses? And
simultaneously someone else
said, FEMA said it wasn’t
safe	to	be	there.
What I’m hearing, she said,
which	is	sort	of	scary,	is	they
all	want	to	stay	in	Texas.

He gave me the flashlight,
she	said,	I	didn’t	want	to	turn
it	on.	It	was	all	black.	I	didn’t
want	to	shine	a	light	on	that.
We never reached out to
anyone to tell our story,
because there’s no ending to
our story, he said. Being
honest with you, in my
opinion,	they	forgot	about	us

It’s awful, she said, to go
back home to find your own
dead	child.	It’s	really	sad.

And	so	many	of	the	people	in
the	arena	here,	you	know,	she
said, were underprivileged
anyway, so this is working
very	well	for	them.
You simply get chills every
time you see these poor
individuals,	so	many	of	these
people	almost	all	of	them	that
we	see,	are	so	poor,	someone
else said, and they are so
black.

Have	you	seen	their	faces?
Then this aestheticized
distancing from Oh my God,
from unbelievable, from
dehydration,	
from
overheating,	
from	
no
electricity,	no	power,	no	way
to	communicate
we	are	drowning	here
still	in	the	difficulty
as if the faces in the images
hold	all	the	consequences
and the fiction of the facts
assumes randomness and
indeterminacy.

He said, I don’t know what
the water wanted. It wanted
to show you no one would
come.He said, I don’t know what
the water wanted. As if then
and now were not the same
moment.
He said, I don’t know what
the	water	wanted.
Call	out	to	them.
I	don’t	see	them.Call	out	anyway.
Did	you	see	their	faces?

My brothers are notorious.
They	have	not	been	to	prison.
They have been imprisoned.
The	prison	is	not	a	place	you
enter. It is no place. My
brothers are notorious. They
do regular things, like wait.
On my birthday they say my
name. They will never forget
that we are named. What is
that	memory?The days of our childhood
together	were	steep	steps	into
a collapsing mind. It looked
like we rescued ourselves,
were rescued. Then there are
these days, each day of our
adult lives. They will never
forget	our	way	through,	these
brothers, each brother, my
brother, dear brother, my
dearest	brothers,	dear	heart—
Your hearts are broken. This
is not a secret though there
are secrets. And as yet I do
not understand how my own
sorrow has turned into my
brothers’	hearts.	The	hearts	of
my brothers are broken. If I
knew another way to be, I
would call up a brother, I
would	hear	myself	saying,	my
brother, dear brother, my
dearest	brothers,	dear	heart—
On the tip of a tongue one
note following another is
another path, another dawn
where the pink sky is the
bloodshot of struck, of
sleepless, of sorry, of
senseless, shush. Those years
of and before me and my
brothers,	the	years	of	passage,
plantation, migration, of Jim
Crow	segregation,	of	poverty,
inner cities, profiling, of one
in three, two jobs, boy, hey
boy, each a felony,
accumulate into the hours
inside	our	lives	where	we	are
all caught hanging, the rope
inside us, the tree inside us,
its roots our limbs, a throat
sliced through and when we
open our mouth to speak,
blossoms, o blossoms, no
place coming out, brother,
dear brother, that kind of
blue.	The	sky	is	the	silence	of
brothers all the days leading
up	to	my	call.

If I called I’d say good-bye
before	I	broke	the	good-bye.	I
say good-bye before anyone
can hang up. Don’t hang up.
My brother hangs up though
he is there. I keep talking.
The	talk	keeps	him	there.	The
sky	is	blue,	kind	of	blue.	The
day	is	hot.	Is	it	cold?	Are	you
cold? It does get cool. Is it
cool?	Are	you	cool?
My brother is completed by
sky.	

 The sky is his silence.
Eventually, he says, it is
raining. It is raining down. It
was raining. It stopped
raining.	It	is	raining	down.	He
won’t hang up. He’s there,
he’s there but he’s hung up
though	he	is	there.	Good-bye,
I	say.	I	break	the	good-bye.	I
say good-bye before anyone
can hang up, don’t hang up.
Wait with me. Wait with me
though the waiting might be
the	call	of	good-byes

In the next frame the pickup
truck	is	in	motion.	Its	motion
activates its darkness. The
pickup	truck	is	a	condition	of
darkness in motion. It makes
a dark subject. You mean a
black subject. No, a black
object.Then	the	pickup	is	beating	the
black object to the ground
and	the	tire	marks	the	crushed
organs. Then the audio, I ran
that nigger over, is itself a
record-breaking hot June day
in	the	twenty-first	century.
The pickup returns us to live
cruelty, like sunrise, red
streaks falling from dawn to
asphalt—then again this
pickup is not about beauty.
It’s	a	pure	product.
The	announcer	patronizes	the
pickup truck, no hoodlums,
“just teens,” no gang, “just a
teen,” “with straggly blond
hair,” “a slight blond man.”
The pickup is human in this
predictable way. Do you
recognize	yourself,	Dedmon?

In the circulating photo you
are looking down. Were you
dreaming of this day all the
days of your youth? In the
daydream	did	the	pickup	take
you home? Was it a pickup
fueling the road to I ran that
nigger	over?
Baldwin says skin color
cannot be more important
than the human being. And
was the pickup constructing

or	exploding	whiteness	out	of
you? You are so sorry. You
are	angry,	an	explosive	anger,
an effective one: I ran that
nigger	over.James Craig Anderson is
dead. The pickup truck is a
figure of speech. It is as the
crown standing in for the
kingdom. Who told you it
was	a	crown?	Did	we	tell	you
the pickup was as good as
home? You are so young,
Dedmon.	You	were	so	young
 is
dead. What ails you,
Dedmon? What up? What’s
up is James Craig Anderson
is dead. So sorry. So angry,
an imploding anger. It must
let	you	go.	It	let	you	go


As he walked across grass
still green from summer
walking	out	of	the	rain	a	step
beyond into a piece of sky
dry all day for him in this
moment a shelter as he sat
beneath the overhanging
branches of the “white tree”
surprising himself at the
center of the school yard
thinking of the slight give in
the cushions of the counter
seats he had read about in
textbooks	did	the	hardness	of
the	ground	cross	the	hardness
of the seats in buses as he
waited	to	be	noticed	listening
to the lift and fall of the
leaves	above	him?
As the boys walked across
grass a darkening wave as
dusk folded into night
walking toward a dawn sunpunching	
through	
the
blackness as they noosed the
rope looped around the
overhanging	branches	of	their
tree surprising themselves at
the center of the school yard
thinking	this	is	how	they	will
learn the ropes did the
hardness	in	the	history	books
cross the hardness in their
eyes all the eyes with that
look without give did they
give that look to the lift and
fall	of	the	leaves	above	them?

At the high school party the
boy turned to the boys as
boys do walking into a fist
punching	
through	
the
blackness as glass shattered
light	knocked	conscious	blunt
breathing	
bruising	
the
refusing boy surrounded by
blows taking custody of his
body bodying forth against a
boyhood defining it by
fighting through this body
propelled forward and back
bearing until the beer bottle
shattered hardness bruising
the refusal leveled without
give.
When the boys turned the
corner was inflammation in
the air already forming
knuckles as they pummeled
the body being kicked and
beaten	
until	
knocked
unconscious his right eye
closed shut blood refusing to
clot flowing from both ears
were they hearing their own
breathing their own ears
allowing their blows to take
custody of this body fallen
against the hardness of the
concrete	floor	leveled	without
give?

Boys	will	be	boys	being	boys
feeling	their	capacity	heaving
butting heads righting their
wrongs in the violence of
aggravated	
adolescence
charging	forward	in	their	way
experiencing the position of
positioning which is a
position for only one kind of
boy face it know it for the
other boy for the other boys
the fists the feet criminalized
already are weapons already
exploding the landscape and
then	the	litigious	hitting	back
is	life	imprisoned.


I	knew	whatever	was	in	front
of me was happening and
then the police vehicle came
to	a	screeching	halt	in	front	of
me	like	they	were	setting	up	a
blockade. Everywhere were
flashes, a siren sounding and
a stretched-out roar. Get on
the	ground.	Get	on	the	ground
now.	Then	I	just	knew.


And you are not the guy and
still you fit the description
because	there	is	only	one	guy
who	is	always	the	guy	fitting
the	description.

I left my client’s house
knowing I would be pulled
over. I knew. I just knew. I
opened my briefcase on the
passenger seat, just so they
could see. Yes officer rolled
around on my tongue, which
grew out of a bell that could
never ring because its
emergency was a tolling I
was	meant	to	swallow.
In	a	landscape	drawn	from	an
ocean bed, you can’t drive
yourself sane—so angry you
are crying. You can’t drive
yourself sane. This motion
wears a guy out. Our motion
is wearing you out and still
you	are	not	that	guy.

Then flashes, a siren, a
stretched-out roar—and you
are not the guy and still you
fit the description because
there is only one guy who is
always the guy fitting the
description.
Get	on	the	ground.	Get	on	the
ground now. I must have
been speeding. No, youweren’t speeding. 

I wasn’t
speeding? You didn’t do
anything wrong. Then why
are you pulling me over?
Why am I pulled over? Put
your	hands	where	they	can	be
seen. Put your hands in the
air.	Put	your	hands	up.
Then	you	are	stretched	out	on
the	hood.	Then	cuffed.	Get	on
the	ground	now.Each time it begins in the
same way, it doesn’t begin
the same way, each time it
begins	it’s	the	same.	Flashes,
a	siren,	the	stretched-out	roar
—
Maybe because home was a
hood the officer could not
afford, not that a reason was
needed, I was pulled out of
my vehicle a block from my
door, handcuffed and pushed
into the police vehicle’s
backseat, the officer’s knee
pressing into my collarbone,
the officer’s warm breath
vacating a face creased into
the smile of its own private
joke.

Each time it begins in the
same way, it doesn’t begin
the same way, each time it
begins	it’s	the	same.

Go

hit	
me
motherfucker fled my lips
and	the	officer	did	not	need	to
hit me, the officer did not
need anything from me
except	the	look	on	my	face	on
the drive across town. You
can’t	drive	yourself	sane.	You
are	not	insane.	Our	motion	is
wearing	you	out.	You	are	not
the	guy.

This	is	what	it	looks	like.	You
know this is wrong. This is
not what it looks like. You
need to be quiet. This is
wrong. You need to close
your	mouth	now.	This	is	what
it looks like. Why are you
talking if you haven’t done
anything	wrong?
And you are not the guy and
still you fit the description
because	there	is	only	one	guy
who	is	always	the	guy	fitting

In	a	landscape	drawn	from	an

The charge the officer
decided on was exhibition of
speed. I was told, after the
fingerprinting,	to	stand	naked.
I stood naked. It was only
then	I	was	instructed	to	dress,
to leave, to walk all those
miles	back	home.
And still you are not the guy
and still you fit the
description because there is
only one guy who is always
the	guy	fitting	the	description.

When	he	opened	his	mouth	to

was	written	in	the	silence,
the length of the silence
becoming	a	living.

And	what	had	been
“I do solemnly swear that I

Though	this	house	in	London
has been remodeled, the
stairs,	despite	being	carpeted,
creak.	What	was	imagined	as
a	silent	retreat	from	the	party
seems to sound through the
house. By the fifth step you
decide	to	sit	down	and	on	the
wall next to you is a torn
passport photo of half a
woman’s face blown up and
framed	as	art.	Where	did	you
imagine	you	were	going?	you
say	aloud	to	her.

“The purpose of art,” James
Baldwin	wrote,	“is	to	lay	bare
the questions hidden by the
answers.” He might have
been	
channeling
Dostoyevsky’s statement that
“we	have	all	the	answers.	It	is
the questions we do not
know.”Where can I imagine you
have	been?
A man, a novelist with the
face of the English sky—full
of weather, always in
response, constantly shifting,
clouding over only to clear
briefly—stands before you,
his head leaning against the
same	wall	as	the	torn-up	girl.
You begin discussing the
recent riots in Hackney.

Despite what is being said
you get lost in his face, his
responsiveness bringing what
reads	as	intimacy	to	his	eyes.
He	says	the	riots	were	similar
to	the	Rodney	King–LA	riots;
however, he feels the UK
media handled them very
differently from the US
media.
The Hackney riots began at
the end of the summer of
2011 when Mark Duggan, a
black man, a husband, a
father, and a suspected drug
dealer, was shot dead by
officers	from	Scotland	Yard’s
Operation Trident (a special
operations unit addressing
gun	
crime	
in	
black
communities). As the rioting
and	
looting	
continued,
government officials labeled
the	
violent	
outbreak
“opportunism” and “sheer
criminality,” and the media
picked up this language.

Whatever the reason for the
riots, images of the looters’
continued	rampage	eventually
displaced the fact that an
unarmed man was shot to
death.

In the United States, Rodney
King’s beating, caught on
video, trumped all other
images. If there had been a
video of Duggan being
executed, there might be less
ambiguity around what
started the riots, you hazard
to	say.
Will you write about
Duggan? the man wants to
know. Why don’t you? you
ask. Me? he asks, looking
slightly	irritated.

How difficult is it for one
body to feel the injustice
wheeled at another? Are the
tensions,	the	recognitions,	the
disappointments, and the
failures that exploded in the
riots	too	foreign?
A similar accumulation and
release	
drove	
many
Americans to respond to the
Rodney	King	beating.	Before
it happened, it had happened
and happened. As a black
body in the States, your
response	was	necessary	if	you
were	to	hold	on	to	the	fiction
that this was an event
“wrongfully	
ordinary,”

therefore a snafu within the
ordinary.

Though the moment had
occurred and occurred again
with	the	deaths,	beatings,	and
imprisonment	
of	
other
random, unarmed black men,
Rodney King’s beating
somehow cut off the air
supply	in	the	US	body	politic
by virtue of the excessive,
blatant	barrage	of	racism	and
compromised justice that
followed on the heels of his
beating. And though in this
man’s	body,	the	man	made	of
English sky, grief exists for
Duggan as a black man
gunned	down,	there	is	not	the
urgency brought on by an
overflow of compromises,
deaths, and tempers specific
to	a	profile	woke	to	and	gone
to	sleep	to	each	day.

Arguably, there is no
simultaneity between the
English sky and the body
being	ordered	to	rest	in	peace.
This difference, which has to
do with “the war (the black
body’s)	
presence	
has
occasioned,”	
to	
quote
Baldwin, makes all the
difference.	One	could	become
acquainted	
with	
the
inflammation that existed
around	Duggan’s	body	and	it
would be uncomfortable.

Grief	
comes	
out	
of
relationships to subjects over
time	and	not	to	any	subject	in
theory, you tell the English
sky, to give him an out. The
distance between you and
him is thrown into relief:
bodies moving through the
same life differently. With
your eyes wide open you
consider what this man and
you, two middle-aged artists,
in	a	house	worth	more	than	a
million pounds, share with
Duggan. Mark Duggan, you
are part of the misery.

Apparently your new friend
won’t write about Mark
Duggan or the London riots;
still you continue searching
his face because there is
something to find, an answer
to	question.

Something is there before us
that is neither the living
person	himself	nor	any	sort	of
reality, neither the same as
the one who is alive, nor
another.
What is there is the absolute
calm of what has found its place.

Every day I think about
where	I	came	from	and	I	am
still	proud	to	be	who	I	am	...

	

Perhaps the most insidious
and least understood form of
segregation is that of the
word.

The Algerian men, for their
part, are a target of criticism
for	their	European	comrades.
Arise directly to the level of
tragedy.Notice too, illustrations of
this kind of racial prejudice
can	be	multiplied	indefinitely.
Clearly,	the	Algerians	who,	in
view of the intensity of the
repression and the frenzied
character of the oppression,
thought	they	could	answer	the
blows received without any
serious	
problem	
of
conscience.	

And there is no
 who
has not felt, briefly or for
long periods, with anguish
sharp or dull, in varying
degrees	and	to	varying	effect,
simple,	
naked,	
and
unanswerable	hatred;	who	has
not wanted to smash any
white face he may encounter
in a day, to violate, out of
motives of the cruelest
vengeance ... to break the
bodies	of	all	white	people	and
bring	them	low,	as	low	as	the
dust into which he himself
has been and is being
trampled; no black who has
not had to make his own
precarious adjustment ... yet
the	adjustment	must	be	made
—rather	it	must	be	attempted.

Do you think two minutes
from	the	end	of	a	World	Cup
final, two minutes from the
end	of	my	career,	I	wanted	to
do	that?	

Each	decision	gave	rise	to	the
same hesitations, produced
the	same	despair.

No	one	is	free.
For	all	that	he	is,	people	will
say he remains for us an
Arab. “You can’t get away
from	nature.”	

Let him do his spite: My
services	which	I	have	done	...
Shall	
out-tongue	
his
complaints.	

When	such	things	happen,	he
must	grit	his	teeth,	walk	away
a few steps, elude the
passerby	who	draws	attention
to him, who gives other
passersby the desire either to
follow the example or to
come to his defense. 


That	man	who	is	forced	each
day to snatch his manhood,
his	identity,	out	of	the	fire	of
human cruelty that rages to
destroy it, knows ...
something about himself and
human life that no school on
earth—and	indeed,	no	church
—can teach. He achieves his
own authority, and that is
unshakable.

This is because, in order to
save his life, he is forced to
look beneath appearances, to
take nothing for granted, to
hear the meaning behind the
words.
We hear, then we remember.


The state of emergency is
also always a state of
emergence.	

But at this moment—from
whence came the spirit I
don’t know—

I resolved to
fight; and, suiting my action
to the resolution ...


what	we	have	here	is	not	the
bringing to light of a
character	
known	
and
frequented a thousand times
in the imagination or in
stories.

It is the White Man who
creates the black man. But it
is	the	black	man	who	creates.

This thing was there, we
grasped it in the living
motion.	
What he said “touched the
deepest part of me.”

The rebuttal assumes an
original	form.This endless struggle to
achieve and reveal and
confirm a human identity,
human	authority,	contains,	for
all its horror, something very
beautiful.	

Making	Room
Script for Public Fiction at
Hammer	MuseumOn the train the woman
standing	
makes	
you
understand there are no seats
available. And, in fact, there
is one. Is the woman getting
off at the next stop? No, she
would	rather	stand	all	the	way
to	Union	Station.
The space next to the man is
the pause in a conversation
you are suddenly rushing to
fill.	You	step	quickly	over	the
woman’s fear, a fear she
shares.	You	let	her	have	it.
The	
man	
doesn’t
acknowledge you as you sit
down	because	the	man	knows
more about the unoccupied
seat than you do. For him,
you imagine, it is more like
breath than wonder; he has
had	to	think	about	it	so	much
you	wouldn’t	call	it	thought.

When another passenger
leaves his seat and the
standing woman sits, you
glance	over	at	the	man.	He	is
gazing out the window into
what	looks	like	darkness.

You	sit	next	to	the	man	on	the
train, bus, in the plane,
waiting room, anywhere he
could be forsaken. You put
your body there in proximity
to, adjacent to, alongside,
within.
You don’t speak unless you
are spoken to and your body
speaks to the space you fill
and you keep trying to fill it
except the space belongs to
the body of the man next to
you,	not	to	you.

Where he goes the space
follows him. If the man left
his seat before Union Station
you	would	simply	be	a	person
in a seat on the train. You
would cease to struggle
against the unoccupied seat
when where why the space
won’t	lose	its	meaning.
You	imagine	if	the	man	spoke
to you he would say, it’s
okay, I’m okay, you don’t

need to sit here. You don’t
need to sit and you sit and
look past him into the
darkness the train is moving
through.	A	tunnel.
All the while the darkness
allows you to look at him.
Does he feel you looking at
him? You suspect so. What
does suspicion mean? What
does	suspicion	do?

The soft gray-green of your
cotton	coat	touches	the	sleeve
of him. You are shoulder to
shoulder	though	standing	you
could feel shadowed. You sit
to repair whom who? You
erase that thought. And it
might	be	too	late	for	that.
It	might	forever	be	too	late	or
too	early.	The	train	moves	too
fast	for	your	eyes	to	adjust	to
anything	beyond	the	man,	the
window, the tiled tunnel, its
slick darkness. Occasionally,
a	white	light	flickers	by	like	a
displaced	sound.

From across the aisle tracks
room harbor world a woman
asks	a	man	in	the	rows	ahead
if he would mind switching
seats. She wishes to sit with
her	daughter	or	son.	You	hear
but	you	don’t	hear.	You	can’t
see.It’s	then	the	man	next	to	you
turns to you. And as if from
inside your own head you
agree	that	if	anyone	asks	you
to move, you’ll tell them we
are	traveling	as	a	family.

 In
 The
Justice	System

some years there exists a
wanting	to	escape—
you, floating above your
certain	ache—
still	the	ache	coexists.
Call	that	the	immanent	you—


You	are	you	even	before	you
grow	into	understanding	you
are	not	anyone,	worthless,
not	worth	you.
Even as your own weight
insists
you	are	here,	fighting	off
the	weight	of	nonexistence.

And still this life parts your
lids,	you	see
you seeing your extending
hand
as	a	falling	wave—

I	they	he	she	we	you	turn
only	to	discover
the	encounter
to	be	alien	to	this	place.
Wait.
The patience is in the living.

Time	opens	out	to	you.
The opening, between you
and	you,	occupied,
zoned	for	an	encounter,
given	the	histories	of	you	and
you—
And	always,	who	is	this	you?

The	start	of	you,	each	day,
a	presence	already—
Hey	you—Slipping down burying the
you buried within. You are
everywhere and you are
nowhere	in	the	day.
The	outside	comes	in—
Then	you,	hey	you—

Overheard	in	the	moonlight.
Overcome	in	the	moonlight.

Soon you are sitting around,
publicly listening, when you
hear this—what happens to
you doesn’t belong to you,
only	half	concerns	you.	He	is
speaking of the legionnaires
in Claire Denis’s film Beau


Travail and you are pulled
back into the body of you
receiving	the	nothing	gaze—
The world out there insisting
on this only half concerns
you. What happens to you
doesn’t belong to you, only
half concerns you. It’s not
yours.	Not	yours	only.

And still a world begins its
furious	erasure—
Who do you think you are,
saying	I	to	me?
You	nothing.
You	nobody.You.
A body in the world drowns
in	it—
Hey	you—
All	our	fevered	history	won’t
instill	insight,
won’t	turn	a	body	conscious,

won’t	make	that	look
in the eyes say yes, though
there	is	nothing
to	solve
even as each moment is an
answer.Don’t say I if it means so
little,
holds the little forming no
one.
You are not sick, you are
injured—
you	ache	for	the	rest	of	life.

How to care for the injured
body,
the kind of body that can’t
hold
the	content	it	is	living?
And	where	is	the	safest	place
when	that	place
must	be	someplace	other	than
in	the	body?Even now your voice
entangles	this	mouth
whose words are here as
pulse,	strumming
shut	out,	shut	in,	shut	up—
You	cannot	say—
A	body	translates	its	you—
you	there,	hey	you

even	as	it	loses	the	location	of
its	mouth.
When you lay your body in
the	body
entered as if skin and bone
were	public	places,
when you lay your body in
the	body
entered as if you’re theground	you	walk	on,
you	know	no	memory	should
live
in	these	memories
becoming	the	body	of	you.
You slow all existence down
with	your	call
detectable only as sky. The
night’s	yawn
absorbs you as you lie down
at	the	wrong	angle
to	the	sun	ready	already	to	let
go	of	your	hand.

Wait	with	me
though	the	waiting,	wait	up,
might take until nothing
whatsoever	was	done.

To	be	left,	not	alone,	the	only
wish—
to call you out, to call out
you.
Who	shouted,	you?	You
shouted	you,	you	the	murmur

in the air, you sometimes
sounding like you, you
sometimes	saying	you,
go	nowhere,
be	no	one	but	you	first—
Nobody notices, only you’ve
known,you’re	not	sick,	not	crazy,
not	angry,	not	sad—
It’s	just	this,	you’re	injured.

Everything	shaded	everything
darkened	
everything
shadowed
is	the	stripped	is	the	struck—
is	the	trace
is	the	aftertaste.

I	they	he	she	we	you	were	too
concluded yesterday to know
whatever	was	done	could	also
be done, was also done, was
never	done—
The worst injury is feeling
you	don’t	belong	so	much
to	you—

When	the	waitress	hands	your
friend	the	card	she	took	from
you, you laugh and ask what
else her privilege gets her?
Oh, my perfect life, she
answers. Then you both are
laughing	so	hard,	everyone	in
the	restaurant	smiles.

Closed to traffic, the
previously	
unexpressive
street fills with small bodies.
One father, having let go of
his	child’s	hand,	stands	on	the
steps of a building and
watches.	You	can’t	tell	which
child is his, though you
follow his gaze. It seems to
belong	to	all	the	children	as	it
envelops	their	play.	You	were
about to enter your building,

but do not want to leave the
scope	of	his	vigilance.

A friend writes of the
numbing effects of humming
and it returns you to your
own sigh. It’s no longer
audible. You’ve grown into
it. Some call it aging—an
internalized liquid smoke
blurring	ordinary	ache.
Just this morning another,
What	did	he	say?

Come	on,	get	back	in	the	car.
Your	partner	wants	to	face	off
with	a	mouth	and	who	knows
what handheld objects the
other	vehicle	carries.
Trayvon Martin’s name
sounds from the car radio a
dozen times each half hour.
You pull your love back into
the seat because though no
one	seems	to	be	chasing	you,
the justice system has other

plans.
Yes,	and	this	is	how	you	are	a
citizen: Come on. Let it go.
Move	on.
Despite the air-conditioning
you pull the button back and
the window slides down into
its door-sleeve. A breeze
touches your cheek. As
something	should.

What	feels	more	than	feeling?
You are afraid there is
something you are missing,
something	obvious.	A	feeling
that feelings might be
irrelevant if they point to
one’s	irrelevance	pulls	at	you.
Do feelings lose their feeling
if they speak to a lack of
feeling? Can feelings be a

hazard, a warning sign, a
disturbance, distaste, the
disgrace? Don’t feel like you
are mistaken. It’s not that (Is
it not that?) you are
oversensitive	
or
misunderstanding.
You	
know	
feelings
destabilize since everyone
you ask is laughing that kind
of close-the-gap laughter: all
the	
ha-ha’s	
wanting

uninterrupted	views.	Don’t	be
ridiculous. None of the other
black friends feel that way
and	how	you	feel	is	how	you
feel	even	if	what	you	perceive
isn’t	tied	to	what	is	...
What	is?

And so it goes until the vista
includes	only	displacement	of
feeling back into the body,
which gave birth to the
feelings that don’t sit
comfortably	
inside	
the
communal.
You smile dumbly at the
world because you are still
feeling if only the feeling
could be known and this
brings on the moment you
recognize	as	desire.

Every day your mouth opens
and receives the kiss the
world	offers,	which	seals	you
shut though you are feeling
sick to your stomach about
the beginning of the feeling
that was born from
understanding and now
stumbles around in you—the
go-along-to-get-along tongue
pushing your tongue aside.

Yes, and your mouth is full
up and the feeling is still
tottering—

“The	subject	of	so	many	films
is	the	protection	of	the	victim,
and I think, I don’t give a
damn about those things. It’s
not the job of films to nurse
people.	

With	
what’s
happening	in	the	chemistry	of
love, I don’t want to be a
nurse	or	a	doctor,	I	just	want
to	be	an	observer.”

As a child, Claire Denis
wished to be a nurse; she is
no	longer	a	child.	Years	have
passed and so soon we love
this world, so soon we are
willing	to	coexist	with	dust	in
our	eyes.And,	of	course,	you	want	the
days to add up to something
more	than	you	came	in	out	of
the	sun	and	drank	the	potable
water of your developed
world—
yes, and because words hang
in the air like pollen, the
throat	closes.	You	hack	away.

That time and that time and
that	time	the	outside	blistered
the inside of you, words
outmaneuvered years, had
you in a chokehold, every
part roughed up, the eyes
dripping.

That’s the bruise the ice in
the	heart	was	meant	to	ice.
To arrive like this every day
for	it	to	be	like	this	to	have	so
many	memories	and	no	other
memory than these for as
long as they can be
remembered to remember
this.

Though a share of all
remembering, a measure of
all memory, is breath and to
breathe you have to create a
truce—a	truce	with	the	patience	of	a
stethoscope.

I	can	hear	the	even	breathing
that creates passages to
dreams. 

And yes, I want to
interrupt to tell him her us
you me I don’t know how to
end what doesn’t have an
ending.

Tell me a story, he says,
wrapping his arms around
me.Yesterday, I begin, I was
waiting in the car for time to
pass.	A	woman	pulled	in	and
started to park her car facing
mine.	

Our	eyes	met	and	what
passed passed as quickly as
the	look	away.	She	backed	up
and parked on the other side
of the lot. I could have
followed her to worry my
question but I had to go, I
was expected on court, I
grabbed	my	racket.

The sunrise is slow and
cloudy, dragging the light in,
but	barely.

Did	you	win?	he	asks.
It wasn’t a match, I say. It
was	a	lesson.Heaven
 was only half as far that night
at the poetry recital
 listening to the burnt phrases
when I heard the poet have
 a rhyming erection
 then look away with a
 lost look
 ‘Every animal’ he said at last
 ‘After intercourse is sad’
 But the back-row lovers
 looked oblivious

 The world is a beautiful place

 if you don’t mind a touch of hell
 now and then
 just when everything is fine
 because even in heaven
 they don’t sing
 all the time
 The world is a beautiful place
 to be born into
 if you don’t mind some people dying
 all the time
 or maybe only starving
 some of the time
 which isn’t half so bad
 if it isn’t you



Oh the world is a beautiful place
 to be born into
 if you don’t much mind
 a few dead minds
 in the higher places
 or a bomb or two
 now and then
 in your upturned faces
 or such other improprieties
 as our Name Brand society
 is prey to
 with its men of distinction
 and its men of extinction
 and its priests
 and other patrolmen
 and its various segregations
 and congressional investigations
 and other constipations
 that our fool flesh
 is heir to



 Yes the world is the best place of all
 for a lot of such things as
 making the fun scene
 and making the love scene
and making the sad scene
 and singing low songs and having inspirations
 and walking around
 looking at everything
 and smelling flowers
 and goosing statues
 and even thinking
 and kissing people and
 making babies and wearing pants
 and waving hats and
 dancing
 and going swimming in rivers
 on picnics
 in the middle of the summer
 and just generally
 ‘living it up’
 Yes
 but then right in the middle of it
 comes the smiling
 mortician




 Reading Yeats I do not think
 of Ireland
but of midsummer New York
 and of myself back then
 reading that copy I found
 on the Thirdavenue El
 the El
 with its flyhung fans
 and its signs reading
 SPITTING IS FORBIDDEN
 the El
 careening thru its thirdstory world
 with its thirdstory people
 in their thirdstory doors
 looking as if they had never heard
 of the ground
 an old dame
 watering her plant
 or a joker in a straw

 putting a stickpin in his peppermint tie
and looking just like he had nowhere to go
 but coneyisland
 or an undershirted guy
 rocking in his rocker
watching the El pass by
 as if he expected it to be different
 each time
 Reading Yeats I do not think
 of Arcady
and of its woods which Yeats thought dead
 I think instead
 of all the gone faces
 getting off at midtown places
 with their hats and their jobs
 and of that lost book I had
 with its blue cover and its white inside
where a pencilhand had written




HOMECOMING OF LOVE AMONGST ILLUSTRIOUS RUINS
The calcined stones come back.
The fallen temples come back,
The bursted whore houses, the green courtyards
Where the smile of Priapus
Keeps warm the memory of fountains.
My love, let us go along the vanished streets,
Across the bright geometry which still points
To mysterious love and hidden
Pleasures, still so sweet in the night.
Here is the house of the goddess. In the blue
Sanctuary you can still smell the perfume
Of sea foam and jasmine and
Carnations salty with her flesh.
The phallic symbol, jolly as ever,
Riots in the thick foliage — stretched out
On the happy pan of the balance
Which offers it to love. It is heavier
Than all the fruits of the earth.
Aphrodite smiles in the shadows
As she feels the sea throb in her buttocks.


O ancient brightness! O far off light!
Naked light, love, shine on us always.
And when the day comes when we are no more than stones,
After we too, my love, are only ruins,
Let us lie like these stones singing in the sun,
Leading others to love along our vanished ways.


Your womb is smarter than your head,
And as smart as your bottom.
See—
The fierce black grace
Of your naked body.
You are the symbol of the forest,
With your red necklaces,
Your bracelets of curving gold,
And the dark alligator
Swimming in the Zambezi of your eyes.




I remember you as you were that last autumn—
Your grey beret, your calm heart,
And the flames of sunset wrestling in your eyes,
And the leaves falling into the waters of your soul.
You clung to my arm like a vine.
The leaves caught up your slow calm voice—
Vertiginous hearth where my heart blazes—
Sweet blue hyacinth twisting over my soul.
I can feel your eyes, voyaging away, distant as that autumn,
Grey beret, voice of a bird, heart of a huntress—
Where all my deep agony migrated,
Where my happy kisses fell like embers.
The skies from shipboard. Fields from the hills.
Your memory is of light, of smoke, of a still pool.
Deep in your eyes the twilights burned.
The dry leaves of autumn whirled in your soul.
kenneth rexroth




I have shut my windows.
I do not want to hear the weeping.
But from behind the grey walls,
Nothing is heard but the weeping.
There are few angels that sing.
There are few dogs that bark.
A thousand violins fit in the palm of the hand.
But the weeping is an immense angel.
The weeping is an immense dog.
The weeping is an immense violin.
Tears strangle the wind.
Nothing is heard but the weeping.




Facing the palm of fire
Which spreads from the departing sun
Throughout the silent evening—
In this garden of peace—
While flowery Valencia
Drinks the Guadalquiver—
Valencia of slender towers
In the young skies of Ausias March,
Your river changes to roses
At the touch of the sea.
I think of the war. War
Has swept like a tornado
Through the steppes of high Douro,
Through the plains of growing bread,
From fertile Estramadura
To the gardens of lemon trees,
From the grey skies of Asturias
To the marshes of light and salt.
I think that Spain has been sold out,
River by river, mountain by mountain, sea by sea.




Understand that they were sitting just inside the door
At a little table with two full beers and two empties.
There were a few dozen people moving around, killing
Time and getting tight because nothing meant anything
Anymore
Somebody looked at a girl and somebody said
 Great things doing in Spain
But she didn’t even look up, not so much as half an eye.
Then Jack picked up his beer and Nellie her beer
And their legs ground together under the table.
Somebody looked at the clock and somebody said
 Great things doing in Russia
A cop and two whores came in and he bought only two drinks
Because one of them had syphilis
No one knows just why it happened or whether
It would happen ever again on this fretful earth
But Jack picked up his beer again and Nellie her beer again
And, as though at signal, a little man hurried in,
Crossed to the bar and said Hello Steve to the barkeeper.


The Dove walks with sticky feet
Upon the green crowns of the almond tree,
Its feathers smeared over with warmth
Like honey
That dips lazily down into the shadow . . .
Anyone standing in that orchard,
So filled with peace and sleep,
Would hardly have noticed the hill
Nearby
With its three strange wooden arms
Lifted above a throng of motionless people
—Above the helmets of Pilate’s soldiers
Flashing like silver teeth in the sun.


		Seventeen sonnets by Shakespeare of Stratford	

That would defy time, physic's onslaught and havoc,  

Yet could not beget time's most timely desire,	    

Could not convince me otherwise, 

 

 

That I might reverse my fate and not remake 
	

The same mistakes rooted blood makes.  

And thus aging matter procured nothing that death itself    

Could not achieve in a less untimely fashion, 

 

 

Mirror's mirror on the wall, unseemly flesh, 


When mirror's specter is reversed and falls;
  

And upon that dying gray mantle we rest, and wonder not    

Where all appearances and reflections led. 

 



At eighteen you taught me how to see
      The woman who had vanished into air
      Taught me how to see the white wall
    On which the mind paints the colours
      Of its loss, and certainty of loss.
      In you I learned to know what seeing was:
      More than taking things in
      It was the ever-increasing line of trees
      As the car speeds towards the desert
      Where trees are nothing more than 
    Interruptions in the sorry blankness of things.
      You taught me that the blind man
      Can safely travel to the sun, provided he takes
      His cane of ice and does not expect
      Any woman to travel there with him.
    And what does he look for when he
      Gets there? the boy asked.
      He looks for his shadow, you replied,
      But not in words, just a silence
      That was a shadow falling on the mouth. 






Say you wake

At 3:22 AM, alone.

The kitchen is bare

So is the street.

So much so your mind

Dreams multitudes

To compensate, again.

There is no redemption 

From some things

Only a deepening that

Unsettles as much as it

Strengthens our will

To rejoin the heart’s

Ragged army. Morning

Will come soon, but

That changes nothing

Or changes little.




It should’ve happened long ago

But it didn’t. At some point a Metro-North was missed,

And so we said, “We’d leave the following

Morning.” But we wasted the morning feeling off.  

 

There was no time left for touchstones: 

The getting up and stepping into love. 

There was a hardwood floor and a table 

(mahogany), long squares of sun passing

 

Through, though the intersection of the light,

The floor and the table took us only

Almost onto the threshold of feeling 

That the other would be the one who’d come 

 

And say, “The landscape’s awaiting us

Our arrival into the Moonie meadow increasing 

Incrementally through the days, and yes

Yes, I’ll watch you as you age beneath the branch.” 



  It's 5 a.m. in Chengdu China
  I can't sleep
a wink

  Staring out the window
  water drips on dishes
  in the sink

  A bike goes by
  a young gal sits
  side-saddle on the back

  looks like Bhudda's angel daughter
  sent from heaven
  dressed in black

  She glances up
  her dark eyes
  make the morning come to life

  Suddenly I realize
  long ago this angel
was my wife

  Wanted now to tell her
  when we married
  many years ago

  That I never would have left her
  if I knew then
  what I now know

  Waited for what seemed
  1000 years to see
  those eyes again

  Hoping someday I could tell her
  that our love
  would never end

  Never dared to tell her then
  because of all the love
  we shared

  It was more than I could handle
  even though
  I really cared

  Now it's many lifetimes later
  here in Chengdu
5 a.m.

  My favorite wife
  from an earlier life
  the sweetest one of all of them

  Once she told me in our lifetime
  our true love
would never die

  And that even if I left her
  Bhudda's angel
  still would fly

  Now she tells me broken hearts
  will all heal themselves
  in time

  And that all the pain I caused her
  now is gone
  except for mine

  Now in Chengdu
  through the window
  she's come back to me again

  Riding on the back seat
  of a bike
side-saddle with her friend

  Guess that since she passed me by
  there's only one thing
  I can do

  Get myself a new gal
  and a bicycle
  that's built for two

  When in this reincarnation
when I've found
a brand new bride

  Maybe I'll find out
  it's Bhudda's angel
  riding by my side

  Telling me wherever
  we have been
  and through whichever life

  Through all our reincarnations
  she has always been
  my wife

  Now its 7 in the morning
  Chengdu streets
are filled with light

  I'm still staring out the window
  as the day
  is growing bright

  Waiting by the window
  need to see
  my true love's eyes again

  when she rides by
on her bicycle
  side–saddle with her friend

  Then I'll tell her that I love her
  this time I know
what to do

  Waiting by the window
  for my Bhudda angel
  in Chengdu

 


When Harper is at home on her own,
  She keeps the light off so it won’t burn out.
  It is only switched on for good books and gatherings
  of her best friends and their best friends too.

Early in the morning, camping in the country,
  the sun burns straight through the day.
  Wasted in her sleep, light sets cold
  just when she needs a bulb the most.

The trip was planned before him.
  Now, after him, she may as well have come.
  Before she left,
  she unplugged all of her appliances.
  [a quirk he witnessed and said he loved]

Uncertainty swells:
  (in night’s time of siring)
  the backdoor, the hall light,
  her skitter-scattering of feelings of him ...
  unlocked, left on,
  latent ...

Harper–stuck in dark on public land
  remembers her youth:
  throwing sand back into the ocean
  to stop the encroaching waves;
  taping fall leaves to their branches
  to stem the tide of autumnal colors
  piled dead on the sidewalk.

And worst: desperately counting times
  at church she crossed herself for prayer
  because to her, an accidental odd number
  brought the next week under the bright gaze
  of God’s piercing realm.
  She’d leave in a panic–
  is God off or on?

Now, she only has faith in Esther,
  the computer, [visibly unplugged] who will know
  the time and date exactly – unjudging –
  even if it is years until Harper returns
  the electricity to her system.

 

  
 

 Where
is the lord of that chateau?
Where the watchman, where the guard?
Cracks of age are in the sky.
The birds are diving toward the pond.

The
leaves would teach the soil shame.
  It does not know the taste of blood.
An abstinent could never be so thirsty.
Every sip will make it want another.

The
naked man is piping out a tune.
The naked god has put his lyre down,
but canvas cannot put aside
its attributes, and even the painter
did not put down his name, his age.

Where
are the witnesses? Where are the knives? 

 

 Ascending
with a shout into the sky
  is not a common human thing. It seems
  ascension is reserved for holy virgins
  and their martyred sons. We fall into
  abysses or each other's arms, we fall
  from jungle gyms in schoolyards covered with
  graffiti, letters swimming past our eyes,
  singing with the icons on our walls.
  They hum their endless lullabies, but we
  are not allowed to sleep. We have to sing
  along for chorus after chorus. Rising,
  we stumble through hallucinations to
  where toilet seats and bathroom mirrors open
  to receive us - and then we're falling in -
  to our reflections.

I don’t know why I’m doing anything
Well, that’s not entirely true
I do know I’m doing things that are
not entirely for myself
That is giving me some kind of ballast
Am I putting God in front of me?
I don’t believe in god, but I’m putting
something in front of me
It’s the idea that I myself am 
not that significant, even to myself
It’s quite liberating, really
I’m feeling that I can do all these things
and there are really other people
other animals and plants that 
could conceivably be the beneficiaries



But this doesn’t relieve me
of the idea that I might need
actually to know what I’m doing
and why

There is a reason to lose our senses
    as we get to be old
And that is not to feel that the final end is so
    terrible
If we are, so to speak, infantilized, then what we
    encounter
May be merely a kind of odd discomfort, a pain
As from infancy we are accustomed to suffering, and cry
Out our lungs when we are unable to verbalize what we
    feel
And I feel that looking toward others will bring an
    easing
Of that anxiousness I have so often felt, that music
Can help a little, but more it is the ability to look
To others, to see that one is just a small part of the
    picture
So time goes by, others into others, and we are here
And the thing that holds me still is to be by my
    children
To see them happy, the telephone rings, champagne
It is a new year again, we are by the beach again
And we are able to say that we are not unhappy
Everyone is feeling good as they shoot into the sky
But we all know the harrowing lives nearby that are
Bitter and poor, in the sense of not having enough
Poetry can’t mean that much, everyone asleep
Another year, another weight of looking and thinking
About everyone, and then there is just music 
And people walking by the shore, their humble 
Bodies, their self-desires, their anguish, I see
I am a poet, I step on the same sand as Homer



 

 

 

 

 



  He must be twice
her age at least 
With mottled, wrinkled skin 
His hair is dyed a bottle-black 
His face is wintry thin. 

Blue veins snake
down his bone hands 
Like roots of ancient trees 
He wears a pair of checkered shorts 
Above his scrawny knees. 

The girl he's with
is beautiful 
Her shoulder-length black hair 
Surrounds and frames her dark brown face 
Her shoulders soft and bare. 

He drinks his
Mekhong whiskey down 
And orders yet again
The girl he's with just sighs and sneaks 
a smile at other men. 


They sit in
silence, the silly old man
And the girl who stole his heart 
Someone should whisper in his ear 
"Too many years apart!" 

Someone should
whisper in his ear 
"Your girl is bored to death! 
Your eyelids droop, your shoulders stoop 
There's whiskey on your breath!" 

Someone should
whisper in his ear 
That if he didn't pay 
He might just find his lady love 
Would soon be on her way. 

He wallows in her
loving gaze 
So puppy-dog serene 
Serenity for her of course 
His ATM machine. 

 But he might
whisper in our ears 
"Well, don't you think I know?
I made my choice and so will you 
With fewer years to go." 

I'm not sure what
to make of him 
There is no guiding rule 
I wonder if he could be both 
A wise man and a fool. 

He turns his head
to pay the bill 
And suddenly I see
It's a mirror on the wall 
The silly old man is me. 



 


Wine drops were driven, claw hammers,
  through the foreheads of derelicts.
  Five suns burned out in my hand.
 
Plant managers drained workers’ blood
and transfused them with diesel fuel.
  I wanted to save them but could not.

Bored store clerks pushed syringes
of blue stars into their veins.
  Black stones fell from my mouth.

Someone dismembered a boy
and left his heart in the parking garage.
  Five suns burned out in my hand.

A crowd of strangers surrounded me,
  their minds full of rusting razor blades.
  I wanted to save them but could not.

Skeletons sat in echoing houses and beat
each other with wrist bones and femurs.
  Black stones fell from my mouth.

We carried dead children through our days.
They lay in state in our brains’ crystal coffins.
Five suns burned out in my hand.

A black moon drank black constellations
  from a black sky.
  I wanted to save them but could not.

People woke, rinsed faces with dead engine oil.
  Blood blisters bloomed like small pox spots.
  Black stones fell from my mouth.

Five suns burned out in my hand.
  I wanted to save them but could not.
  Black stones fell from my mouth.

 

 




 
I¹d like to say your beauty overwhelmed me;
  your slender back in maroon sweater,
  steel-denimed thighs withdrew my eyes, &
  I missed. To meet your gaze,
  I would swear your pale cheeks
  gold-framed, adorned with pink-
  carnation smile commenced a different game
  between us. Breathing your skin¹s mock perfume
  of cigarettes & whiskey, I¹d confess
  with desire¹s love I threw the first game.
  Or the fifth. To win by losing,
  my victory your happiness. Yet,
  should you return through double doors
  out of the cold that was your absence,
  I¹d tell you nothing, dropping coins on the table
  to earn a rematch, pretending not to want
  that other game a man & woman play.




 

 

    

The child’s hair
    is the color of spice
    grandfather made
    a living by, her eyes
    dark as coffee
    father sold in the market
    everyday, energetic hopeful
    eyes that are quiet
    darkness now.

 You can’t scent
      death in the desert,
      the air is that dry,
      and her picture
      in the evening
      paper is that dry,
      you can’t smell
      her place on the corner
      of those nameless
      broken streets–            

but you can taste
      the wormwood
      bitterness of her days,
      the sweet spices spilled
      irretrievably amid grains
      of sand, the bloodline all
      poured out like anointing
      oils from a ewer, all lost
      irrevocably amid the crude.            

Now the child keeps
      the mother, her spice
      hair attracting a few bold
      young ladies. She defies
      the wagging fingers,
      the unveiled curses
      her thin hands resolutely
      twining and entwining,
      playing hide and seek
      among the clove
      and cardamom, weaving
      through the family
      tapestry, reciting Qur’an
      under her breath. 

 
I am
sorting out dreams that take
place in sometime when never was,
in old prop planes with cracked vinyl
seat covers lengthed like diner booths,

 browned-red
worn and landing in the dark
bare boned tree land with split wood fences
  where I am sorting out people who never
acted or when acting, never acted

"out"
or
"put on" for any-body but themself

aaaaa
and
aaaaaaaaaathen

seldom.
Though, here Dad wagging, like old
bro says, I no recollection. I am sorting out
wind in my hair and no one there who does
not understand me. For I am sorting out fact 

from
fiction, non-plussed by it. Plus dreams

of you,
naked; me holding you pressed up
against me dressed and then your making
bed next to bed on floor from sheets with
pillows thrown comforter in semi-circle I am

with.
  and sorting out dreams

 aaaaa
of
aaaaaaaayou.




 

Ides
of March
April, the cruellest month

You were precocious.

  How cold felt that gunmetal tip
against your thinning pained wrinkled lips ?
how slow, infinite eon minutes
of hesitation
reeling off life, ancestors, shtetls -- paintings ?
how hard the shaking steel on your
curled away tongue tasting
acrid -- metallic --oily ?

The crack
exploding
your brain, burst
tympanums in a nanosecond
  image-time travel - recoil
kicking lose a tooth,
you cut the light to the loneliest
a most definite exit not
with a whimper.

A dark
crimson trickle of a stain
on your feather pillow.
What time was it ? as if that mattered
how cold were you
to your mate's touch ?
  did she scream-roar with a voice
unknown to her, as
I did then twelve years before ?

      A seaside town and the smell of iodine on the beach.
      A town square, just like in Sicily, and dancing.
      The sophisticated son of a common family
    Is aiming for the position of Rosencrantz.       



      He has decided to serve Claudius and he watches
      The prince of the blood closely from behind the fountain.
      The whole world is a prison, and in the world’s courtyard
    A certain John plays the piano.       



      Darkness is coming and the end approaches.
      Ophelia screams in the empty barracks
      And Hamlet walks around, wrapped in a white bandage
    So that the ghost might recognize him in the darkness.

      The Tower of Babel fell on Wednesday.
      Everything is buried under the rubble.
      Speechless men celebrate their triumph.
    Griboedov’s remains return to Nina       



      Chavchavadze. There is much grief to come.
      They will build time on an optical illusion.
      I am tired, you are tired, we are tired — exhaustion
    Has become our space, and our sense, and our order.       



      Bricks are red-skinned, but life is black.
      The completed world begins at the window.
      We write and we talk, but who can remember
      A style as high as a spire, its golden endpoint?









   

 The one who's leg is broken
by falling off some
shelf.

      She dresses her doll in gray
ginghams
& ribbons bounded
into beau ties

  And her English becomes more
hidden with meanings
  So that her intelligience is judged by the man she sleeps with

  A kind and gentle man with manly traits.
I suppose with a somewhat cute
manner

  So, she returns to her old habitual way
TV, radio, computer & keyboard.
It becomes her soul lover
a transmortification
  Always interpreting the audience's
Reaction
  Being impartial of their 
total participation.       



      I do the best I can and the:
misconceptions
mis communications and
mis interpretations
      Has nothing to do with what I did
today,
as long as the philosophy
has not caused any  departures from death

      My blue jeans are in tatters and
I want to get to the next foreign
country,
stay there for a while
and just look over the
horizon.

      I just want to wander the world
like my Dad did
and be a merchant mariner.
Seaward Ho!

      All the daughters of family associations
are vying for power.
and all it is
is another
stupid game
so
turn on the computer
and indulge some free moments;

      Before the house gets cleaned,


 



 


 
The claw crackers, small thin forks, knuckle
the passing
of equipment back and forth
from the table head (our hostess)
then back and around
like roulette, misses and near misses
a pas de deux, the sound, and the fish smell;
the squirts bull's-eye your neighbor. 

Our
rigging and tackle, our bibs,
strike and crash
the fun is nonstop (the horsing around)
high low, draw poker, penny ante, or...
  while shuffling toward the sword dancer
heel to toe, bluffing as we make the rounds. 

Dedicating
this to you is like cheating,
the naming and listing of games
your dance card full, your chip cup too.


Please tell me the name of your favorite river.
Running water over our hands, squeezing
lemon to remove the smell--
  the color of roe your smile
devious as you hide the ace of spades
(no, the jack of hearts)
  under the bridge
just a large table
a successful finesse nonetheless. 




      For centuries we seeded the cemeteries.
    So it was no surprise the soil
    grew nothing but headstones.
      Our hands held bleak acres of newsprint,
    black bouquets of tortures and rapes,
      and rapes as the instrument of torture. 
    Now time runs back into the machinery
      of stars, eats itself like words dissolving
      under the steady force of a delete key.
      Now everything dies before it can occur.
    No one laughs for fear of sanctioning
      the sun’s red bowl of hydrogen,
    the incendiary bubble boiling,
      blowing a typhoon of horses
      and white flames, scalding and scarifying,
    until passion’s scarred arteries 
    become the cracked old crockery
      of long-dead riverbeds.
      In the lunar eclipse,
    a murder was committed. 
    The murderer was unaware he was blind,
    his eyes black as blasted lakes.
    He was unaware that each new street
    he walked was a grave.
      Black sledges brought the dead
    across the white wastes.
    A lone voice keened like a lantern.
    The air was full of harsh smoke,
    I placed half dollars on the victim’s
    staring eyes to calm the river’s
    roiling waters, black as oil sludge,
    that the betrayed might cross to peace.
    We disrobed for the last time,
    stepped out of cold skins,
    and became the last light
    disappearing in the river's current.  


 


i have a double life the homeless (sha)man said
  there are 2 of me
i have 2 selves
  i never use them at the same time

i live in double time
i try not to make it a HABIT

N.Y. is my nightmare my dream
  it is what is beneath the tracks
  defiled virgin whore
  maladjusted transexual godess
  cross-eyed cross dresser
  homeless shaman as greasy as the tracks

i am consumed by jealousy he says
  it is my job to carry this burden
so that you do not

N.Y. is skeleton & frame
heaven hell tributes & lies
  the facts as he sees them
  skyline & light
city of fallen angels
extinguished stars

N.Y. is nature mort
landscape & EATS
  jesus buddha & god

N.Y. lives on borrowed digital time
  like shaman
leading a double life
  the good the bad &
the epi-centre
  outside the centre outside time
  a part of & apart from america
  what is beneath the tracks
  shaman living on outside time

N.Y. is 2 selves
  never the same thing twice
  never living together
as to not use each other up
  body soul
ripped greasy ugly love

N.Y. is what is beneath the self the self the other self.....


 








 Deep in the underwater cave
A drunken submarine lies low
A dream angel swimming in the blue-light
A scuba-ninja with rubbery wings
Smuggles another Russian hit man
Against the wrath of the dark sea 
To the far away Rockaway of the soul 
To the Far Rockaway of the “gold rush” 
To the place of lost and found things 
In the jagged dunes, fishermen and fishing poles
An old sailor with a hangover sings a sad ballad, 
Backwards in time and space, staring at the stars
Here at the edge of the unending continent
Far East Rockaway, very far away
And the mafia song of a don is wailing
As if an angel holds a gun to his white head 
At the gates of Paradise, Saint Solonik stops him
Distorted history falsely recorded for arms merchants
Selective amnesia for super killers 
Distressed grannies trying to commit suicide
Questioning why they ever came to America
In St. Petersburg shadows make the walls cry
Till they fade in the night,
Skulls are breeding
Russian Mafia raising its ugly face
Armies of drowned dogs and blind-sailors 
Rain falls on the subway tracks,
While trains are rushing 
From Far Rockaway of The Body and Mind
To the “lower insider” of “Bratva” in Loisaida.








 



 





With cold wind slipping from brisk
  waters of the Elwha River,
  coiling around me –

frosted topped waves
  cresting cloudy teal
  en route from the glacier peaks – 

 steep valley tributaries


bringing down
          sediments of gabbro and granite,
          stirring them to a brew of
          stone soup in the bottom rapids 

I sat on a dark boulder
  just above the tonguing waters
  scooping drink 

This fleck of Earth,
  seemingly settled with its ancient Douglas Firs –
giant skewers, gaunt in the failing light,
  among mountains, sharp to the inch 

Underneath,
  where the world is so hot
  it is orange with elasticity,
  and rising with pressure,

bright tendrils extend
          from bulbous magma plutons
          and swell into the cracks
          of rock shelving.  There,
          the plates grind, fixing into the earth – crust puzzle 

On a dark boulder,
  the shift of the world,
  no me.


You are here in the blood
At the bottom of the cup
Of the yellow hibiscus
In the Apapane fire cutting through sugarcane
Rain that sweeps each morning down the west Maui mountains
You’re the proud look of my teenage son
Sweetness of his younger brother
Even    (God help me)    in the line of warmth
Along the sleeping body of my wife      



    I fumble stacks of coins into the slot
    Our conversation cracks
  Faulted with my guilt    your resentment      



    I sleep    wake    the window is open to the surf
You break over me in waves
    


 




 In kindergarten
our elders 

Teach
us to memorize by heart

 Each
sugarcoated letter 

In the
ABC of lies

 Because
the aspirin of fact 

Is
a tough
act to swallow. 

Then
we slowly learn 

To shape
letters into 

Plain
words of untruth.

 Afterwards,
we graduate 

To the
art of stringing 

Beads
of pearly words 

Into
lustrous sentences, 

A necklace
of deception. 

Finally
we ourselves become 

Masters
of prevarication 

And fabricate
sentences 

Into
flawless paragraphs 

Of falsehood
which we print 

Into
a hardbound handbook 

Of light
and circulate 

To the
coming generation 

While
the primer of truth 

Gathers
dust and cobwebs 

In some
dark, stuffy corner 

Of the
inarticulate.


  

 Her
tangerine lips and everything so full,
  Mexican eyes like coals burning from obscure to gray,
said she was Italian and Spanish
but Donna Chavez was pura Chicana,
such were the times and I
loved her gleaming tangier lips and the
sway of her body as we danced.
Teasing me, you move pretty good for a white boy,
we left and snuck silently under the watchful kitchen window,
into my room and touched each other lightly, slowly,
my mouth stripping her face of apricot, devouring the essence
for so long, and it was enough until she said,
you don't have to be shy,
and I was too young to know, to not be hurt so
my body worked to a fury of sweat and screams to prove I wasn't.
As morning arrived my pillow
  gleamed with bright zinc orange streaks of lip gloss,
  like the blinding mean wave of the sun,
or a Pollack oil flailing in lines
never understood, but glorious
like seventeen year old Mexican girls
in Los Angeles in 1982 who liked
white boys and were never allowed to be Mexican.
Silently watched her naked pale mouth
quiver in dreams, like an apple dissected, smothered in honey,
fading into browning slices, but still perfect,
with eyes closed, or merely
letting go. Kissing her forehead
as she stirred, wondering what else
would soon be revealed as faded.

No definitive
reason to take the cross-town bus on the coldest day of the year,
but I stood there,
on Mass Ave., a long time, alone.
Suddenly
the wind flung a pair of lace panties sauntering clear across the road.
A dance, a swagger,
virgin's, prostitute's? Behind
me on the Christian Science Building two carved words stared down from
the cornice: PURITY - MERCY. The
color of the underthings somewhere between pink & purple. 

The next
day on the boat above the pink-blue sea I saw newlyweds: she
sat writing thank-you notes, left-handed, diamond & white gold bright.
He sat mute with the
curve of back I've seen only torn by ancient sculptors out of marble.




 

In the
middle of the night the diesel-fuel-blue sound of the train collided with
the brilliance of the moon. She
knelt up on the bed to close the storm window. Then
the dream, The Private Viewing Parlor of Kazakstan, could begin
in peace. She
told me that some of the participants in the room merely embraced. Others,
she revealed shyly turning in underpants & pantyhose as she dressed for
work, did more. We
figured most of it was triggered by the Paris sex shop scenes Kieslowski
used for backdrop
in the first of his tri-color films, Blue, which we saw earlier
that night. 

Since
the self-titled dream called itself "Private," I didn't hound her for
details. The
young woman who performed on stage in the film, wasn't she afraid her
father was in the audience? Didn't
she tell Juliette Binoche he glanced at his watch in order to catch the
last train to Montpellier? Wouldn't
my wife, whose own father died when she was three, want him to join her
anywhere, even in the viewing parlor? (In French, so to
speak?) She
steps bravely into the blue Monday of work, her unresolved longing, naked,
played out on the big, blue screen of grief. 





Bloated bellies, shoeless feet, 

dusty streets and mildew,

the thick sweet smell of rotting plants, 

small watt bulbs that flicker, 

and everywhere the wail and fear 

of voodoo's living dead --

surely not the stuff of joy -- 

yet joy is what the young priest claimed 

abounds in Plaissance, Haiti.

 

Was Haiti not the cruel place, 

where grand cru wines and strong dark rum, 

French cuisine and kinky sex 

were plentiful and cheap; 

where a few bucks ended

a wretched life, and cast 

a junior Consular 'to the netherworld 

of money, drugs and power, 

forty years ago in Port-au-Prince?

 

Hand-by-hand 

the felt-lined basket passes to my lap. 

There, 

under the young priest's patient, prayerful eyes, 

slowly,

I empty my wallet 

for the joy in Plaissance, Haiti. 

 






 I'm 16 and skating
  around and around the ring,
  trying to make sense of how
  life's treated me so far.

In the center, doing lopsided spins,
  I'm like the dog circling and circling nose to tail,
  trampling reality to make his bed of comfort
  dizzying the world to a blur
  before it can shake me apart.

Suddenly ELO's "Livin' Thing" comes on over the loudspeakers
  and it all clicks. I head out to the far edge,
hugging the wall for maximum speed
  the gypsy violins squeezing out my hurt
  and replacing it with adrenaline.

The ice is forgiving.
  It cradles my blades.
  My stride is sure
  from hip to toes.        

Session's ending. The vapid cha-cha version of
  "What Now My Love" blasts
  behind the announcer's voice.
  As the ice empties I sneak one last victory lap
  as if my life depended on it
  and for now, it does. 


First was the face of the friendly driver at the Leonardo da Vinci airport
  The fake smile of the porter when I tipped him with US dollars
  The unsophisticated faces of the visitors at the Galleria Villa Borghese
  The face of Franco Trevisi and the chase on foot to the Trevi Fountain
  The face of the owner of La Piccolo Aranha when we sent the wine back
  He returned with another bottle and a bowl of strawberries
  All this and more was immortalized in writings, on photos and videos
  Interlaced Roman profiles, Mediterranean eyes staring, grimacing
  The desperate faces of Asian women selling scarves in Piazza Navona
  The perverse smiles of the people who sent us in the wrong direction
  The guard’s angry visage when I photographed the paintings at Uffizi gallery
  The confused mug of the guide at the Coliseum when asked: “What is a `camelopard?’”
  At Fico bar the excited appearance of Sandro Dernini, the art impresario
  The impatient faces of artists and writers when Massimo prepares risotto
  The grave facial expression of City Officials at a St. Catherine Parade in Siena
  Transplaced pilgrimage to retrace Dante’s face and his steps in exile
  Embracing the Mediterranean spaces, Tuscan places and Etruscan graces
  To the towers of Purgatory! My fellow travelers!  Heads up!
  A vertical horse race on the narrow staircase, from the top to the base
  The long faces of marching soldiers when I told them not to go back to Iraq
  The unfazed face of the old jogger when I asked for Santa Croce in Florence
  The annoyed facial contortion of the old waiter when asked if he knew Marrinetti
  The Florentine face of the woman who compared herself to the painting of Botticelli
  The wise disguise of the Jews in the Venice ghetto and in Florence’s synagogue
  The distorted faces of Catholic Priests, nuns and worshipers at Mass in Como
  The defaced, on purpose, Marilyn Monroe image that sold for big bucks
  The radiant faces of Stash, Katherina and their son Micha in Bellagio and Lecco
  The confused faces of Elena and Gianpaulo driving from Milano to Picasso
  The Fellini-like expression of the count Federico Sangiardi Quinto Di Wardal
  His blue-blood family tree “growing” since Egyptian times in Alexandria
  These were the faces of Italy, the faces reminiscent of Dante’s Divine Comedy
  The faces of Kings, heroes and nobles, of poets, artists, concubines and dancers
  Recalling the faces and places, difficult to describe and even harder to forget.

 

 



 
 
Fear and shame, you are the checkpoint
  of the soul where all that shines
is rifle-butted
back into
  this land of frozen smiles,
  where I am never listening
  to a woman as she moans
  about her day, shyly bowing
my head, making her laugh
and wetly kissing her in the summer
of her lips, my bones are now
  a Bering beach, where I linger, snow pile
the sun cannot quite reach 

 



 


1
Nazi thinkers claimed his blessing, but Herr Nietzsche's life was clean.
Walter Kaufmann spied injustice—such a cause for strife was clean.
    

2
  Nietzsche's war years saw no fighting—his flawed eyes were far too weak.
  He attended wounds from gunshots; he made sure the knife was clean.

3
  Dionysus met Apollo in Die Geburt der Tragödie.
—the aesthetic words were soiled, while the lure of fife was clean.

4
  Europe needs its brightest thinkers—no one race builds ancient Greece.
Der Übermensch was not a Hitler; latent strength so rife was clean.

5
  Friedrich's school days saw no wenching, still his life proved short and sweet 
—his syphilis was his parents', being void of wife was clean. 

 


face
down upon
wet leaves where
  no more shall fall
i'd forgotten this moment
when trees cease their applause
upon the stage
my father returns to
avert the final curtain–
  its drop, heavy,
white & fleece
weighing down upon his arms
as impending age settles in
our eyes, lapsing to dilations
like stones skimming a pond,
absorbed by blinking crescents
where shadows seep, then
hemorrhage out
through the teeth of life's terminal gate
here, we've wrestled with death's claws
whose gnarled thumbs gouge through
our petrified, leaden hearts,
then leave us to wander
blind, deaf
and mute after
the last rustle of spring 



 

 


And the
quiet shrinks into my breast
  Like dead fish.
Fulton Street is alive catering these deaths–
  I hear their mangled suffocations
Between wailing car alarms at 2AM
Mourning the previous day's losses
The East River has developed
Sleep apnea. It tosses out its dark dreams.
I reach out, arms tight with want.
A cold glass fills with blood on Water
Street, stones and knives
Along the contemplative bridge
A helicopter chops sky:
To
drink a city 
To
chew a river 
To
smash my epitaph open 
Where
my mother aborts me again
  Humming through
A requiem of melted snow
Arsenic is in season
  Freezing notes in our hearts.



 

 
15 April 1992
I stayed home
  all day.
Friends came,
friends went.
Afterwards
  I there was a storm.
In
  Lhassa, Tibet, a blind lama died. 

16 APRIL 1992
I stayed home
  all day.
No one came.
The body of
  the Tibetan lama was moved to a hill.
A few dozen
  eagles gathered
from among
  all the starving eagles of India, of Asia,
and began
  pecking at the sacred corpse. 

17 APRIL 1992
stayed home
  all day, again.
I read an
  encyclopedia.
All I had
  read I forgot at once.
Only the Tibetan
  lama's bare bones were left.
Empty nirvana,
  indeed ! 

18 APRIL 1992
I stayed home
  all day, again.
Lo and behold,
the dead lama
  had left a son, born in secret.
In deepest
  night, he collected the lama's remains.
After sunrise,
  he made two necklaces with the bones.
One he kept.
The other
  he decided to sell to American poet Allen Ginsberg.
So now nirvana
  links Lhassa and New York !


The kids have been
  playing boisterously in the yard,
    even kids from the neighboring village.
    Somehow the dogs didn't bark, just wagged their tails.
    But the whole village has been playing noisily,
    even the banished chicks and hens.
    It was no place for adults
    with their coughs of alarm.
    Hopscotch, shuttlecock-kicking, scissors-paper-stone,
    to say nothing of running to the spring,
    winning, losing, time knowing no end.
    No need for mother, in her wet apron,
    to keep coming and going to see if they're alright.
    The noisy play is fine, so very fine.
    No trace of any other world at all.
    Why should tomorrow or the day after ever come?
    The children, there were ten or twenty of them,
    the whole country is full of kids like these.
    Then the Beggar's Star shone early in the sky,
    After twilight, came night.
    It became hard to recognize each other's faces
    and one by one they set off homewards.
    Thank heaven children have names!
    "Illyong-a, Samryong-a, Kuryong-a, Mansop-a! "
    Especially, that children have names in the dark.
    Behind them, the chicks flap up to their perches
    in the coop, defying hunger; just before,
    they were pecking hungrily at one another.
    In the empty yard, where have the noisy games all gone?
    Over the not-so-very-lofty mountain,
    other stars rise, freely following
    the Beggars' Star, announcing their presence
    by little light they can muster.
    How could the world beyond not be down here?
    All night long the wind sleeps, dew falls,
    while the other world comes, plays, then goes.
    When the first cock crows at early dawn
    the others follow suit, from house to house.
    Now is the time for blind folks to gaze off into the distance.
    In their sleep, the children are still kicking off the blankets,
    growing up to be sleepy-heads just like their fathers.

 

 

 Sunset
drops in faraway the earth
Sad singing voice of gone friends
When disappear through wheat field
Along evening sun that burn ruddily
Quiet yearning stays Saddled man's solitude shines
That wait for morning of alien land
Graze in girl's shallow smile lamella
That pass to wave beyond of paned sorrow
Along lullaby of echo Waving petals
Dim recollection which dwell in dew
Season of love
That shine on eye rims that wet as is slightly wet
Solitude of an young day
That is outspread boundlessly
Disappear silently following legend of the fall 



 

    To the Man who created phys. ed.:
    I salute you.  With one hand angled
  symmetrically to the head, and one
  behind my back—fingers crossed. 
  I loathe you, and not just for flag football
  or the early feminist treatments of boy
  versus girl kickball, in the gym on those rain-
    soaked days that seemed to inch by
  as slowly as math class.  But for 9:25 a.m.,
  when Coach Rachin, our stubby coach
  with a Napoleon complex, blew emphatically
  into his whistle, signaled us
  to place our basketballs away
  in the cage, and then he’d utter words
  still threaded deep into my mind,
  a single line, more resonant than Social Studies
  taped speeches of JFK or MLK Jr.—
Hit the showers.  For me it was a daunting
  thirty-yard stagger to the boys’ locker room,
  like the long march to the principal’s office.
    I prayed god would intervene
  in the form of an attendance office note
  or falling light fixture or even earthquakes—
    we never had an earthquake my three years
  in middle school.  Instead, I ambled
    into a purgatory of lost and sweaty socks,
    praying I didn’t have to change
  in front of anyone.  As the other boys
  packed into the locker room,
    some wrapped in thin gym towels,
  some prancing naked—I thought
  of their mom’s whispering to themselves: 
I really wanted a girl.  I watched as the procession
  filed into the all-tile shower, an open room
  that held twenty boys at a time.  And as I stood
  in my swim trunks, about to enter
  this shower—the tile and flailing
    of precious bodies wrapped in a cloud
  of confusion and heavy steam,
  fear and mist— my thoughts were haunted
  to History class and the photographs
  of the gas chambers at Auschwitz.







Down silicate dunes, across impossible dreams
  of black glass and red clay, the horsemen rode--
  seven, implacable, aloof, commanding.
  Their horses' hooves, ringed in steel,
  rang clean on stone, sang of missed days
  and forsaken nights, of the broken chances
  that always spell a desolation of wants.
  The night's hair was braided with weeping.
  The day's winding cloth was woven of weeping.

Factories spilled their workers' preserved hearts,
  their pickled spirits, into the green maw
  of determined and interminable desire.
  Smokestacks choked the sleek wind,
  wrapped their wire scarves round its slim neck
  and squeezed till the air was still as desert rock,
  till storm sewers thrust up a torrent of dead dogs.
Weeping filled the air with the cold taste of remorse.
  Weeping filled the air with the smoke of unseen fires. 

The horsemen rode into a mountain village.
  The air was thin and the horses were breathing hard.
  The men dismounted and drank cups full of spiders
  and delicate webs from the abandoned well.
  Their horses slurped scorpions from a dry trough.
  The men eyed the sun hung at the meridian,
  a desiccated bread crust, a rough quartz icon.
  This morning only mourning doves sang, weeping.
  This evening only bats and owls prayed, weeping.

Orphans trailed through the immolated streets.
  Beggars collapsed into dust and rotted teeth.
  All the houses were littered with dying mice.
  The houseflies wriggled their eyelash-thin feet
  in slow but resolute death.
  Yet empty clothes still got up and went to work,
  and empty clothes still put their checks in the bank.
  Weeping filled the plates with coal grit and ash.
  Weeping filled the pantry with steel filings and sand.

The horsemen could not make their horses stand up.
    They sent their last bullets through the windows
    of the horses' skulls, watched them bleed ball bearings
    and toothless gear wheels and miles of rust.
    There was no shade so the horsemen collapsed
    against a compound's fence, topped with razor wire.
    As sun flamed to earth, they gagged on their tongues.
    Nothing was heard for a long time, not even weeping.
    Nothing was heard for a long time, not even weeping.

 





one, push.

she says 
to my mind you are a pedestrian
in a pale gray coat who, smoking on his way 
to the shop for cigarettes crosses 
paths with the wall window ahead 
of the table at which i am sitting
and she thinks it is elegant this image
he says
i am buying a new brown suit
something between american cut and european—
he has never been to europe never seen chaucer's 
plain slab grave in westminster abbey 
or the cautious motion of the february river liffey  
in truth he knows nothing of caution
whatever that is, nothing of old english 
or that ash to her 
means a letter, not dust—side slit three buttons
he says 
buttons like he is unhooking the letters
she says yes a pale gray coat 
she is fixed on his buttons
the eye hooks
he says 
what kind of coat? i was thinking something
between american and european
she says no i
i was thinking something
i was thinking something about a man
in front of a window who stops—she stops 
—and tips his hat to me
who has your face
but who speaks like William Langland must have
he says
who is William Langland? what kind 
of suits did he wear?  she says
in my mind he did not wear suits
he reclined naked with his wife under an oak 
tree uncapping acorns which he
placed like hats on her nipples
and every now and again when his wife 
heard the sound of the lark
she would tip her hats to him 
and they would hold each other and afterwards 
he would go on uncapping   

two: anchor 

    as they drove she saw a doe on the side of the road.  no motion, only the crane
    and thrash of its neck in the air, a pocket of last energy. ductile doe, struck a minute
  before their approach.  a minute away from stillness.  he was late for an interview. 
  he did not stop, even through the lights.  she said the czech have a word
for this. they call it trapit, when you let a being suffer. before his interview he kissed her 
between her neck and shoulder, on flesh that corresponded to that of the wounded
deer.  she said, the czech have a word for this. he kissed her mouth—it was their first 
kiss — he said do they have a word for this?


three.  pull.

outside, a squirrel falls from a telephone wire. it begins that way. 
  he says, a squirrel that cannot hold on. she says,

    it is snowing.  you see what i mean? later, over coffee, they listen
  to two russian women, speaking partners, who articulate so deliberately, so as to carve 

    every word. they are remarkable in their beauty, the women.
  in the direction of these women he says as it were, which she mistakes for rapture. 

    one of the russian women perches herself on his lap, placing his hat
  on her head, tipping it to her russian friend in acknowledgment. and they are lost

    in each other now, he and the russian mistress.  there is an energy about loss, she says,
    remembering the doe, chaucer, the synchronized egress of the said and the unsaid.  

    there is an energy and a non-energy, the same way one might reach for a bar of soap
  in the bath and, as it slips, huddle motionless in the water. perhaps the energy is
  trapped 

by the non-energy, she wants him to say, but it is not on his
  tongue.  and what is on his
  tongue, she wants to know.  a gaggle of affection?  a waspy lust?  the taste of oak?—

    what does that taste like, anyway?—the energy of loss? he says. do you mean the loss
  of energy?  no, she says, the creases of a letter discarded, the tarnish of a hinge.  he
  smiles at the russian 

    mistress. she says hatless acorns.  she holds his hand across the table, places his hand
    on her chest. she says, see what i mean



  After the bleak first winter in Brooklyn 
Exiled from Manhattan 
in the backyard of my row-house, 
the size of a tiny Village studio 
dogwood blooms 
like an overnight sensation 
a profusion of intense satin pink 
coy and bold, modest and dazzling 
like a young geisha 
in a ravishing kimono 

Late this year, says my neighbor 
who has seen it bloom for seventeen springs 
A tinge of envy in his melancholy voice 
he has crocuses and daffodils 
and tulips from Brooklyn Botanic Garden 
Already bloomed and withered  
As I covet a neighbor's magnolia, 
He must covet my dogwood 

I do not tell him 
about the fiery glow it casts on my wooden floor 
nor about the elation I feel 
when I dip my bare feet as though it was a river 
when I have my morning coffee 
watching birds whose names I do not know
come and sing with frivolous generosity 
and flit away with indifference and such levity   

Instead 
I gaze up at the haughty glory in the thin morning sunlight 
all blooms, leafless yet  
A disquieting, erotic and despairing perfection 

Unable to write 
I rearrange the books yet again 
and rehang the pictures on the wall 
and walk to The Narrows bay  
with a book: 
La Dame Aux Camelias by Dumas fils    
deserted streets of spring trees   
babysitters' chatter in Spanish in someone's backyard  
a meringue playing on a radio 
laughter and shouts of their young charges 
The only people I pass 
a Muslim woman and her twin girls 
lovely in skinny yellow pants and gray blouses 
brown-eyed, and in iris-blue head scarves 
the girls skip along to the rhythm of an exotic song in their heads 

From the 69th Street pier, 
where Mexican men in baseball caps fish 
practicing the Zen of waiting 
I could almost reach out  
across the wide rippling body of water 
and touch Manhattan 
the silvery, floating island of bottomless desire 
once I so feared to leave 
On whose shore I buried all regrets and envy 
when I left  
for whom I pine a little less each day  

After the last round of the Mister Softee ice-cream truck    
over treetops and rooftops with black-tarred chimneys   
the sky mimics a Florentine sky in Renaissance paintings    
a baby blue canvas feathered with soft orange clouds    
One by one, then, neighbors return    
to the street of United Nations:   
a Turk, a Chinese, an Irish, a Pole, a Russian, and an Italian    
the misty street with elongated shadows   
shot through with the last rays of the sun   
shared with alley cats, an occasional possum and a raccoon    

At night in bed   
with windows open to the backyard  
where the dogwood tree  
keeps to itself  
its desire a muted flame  
I listen  
to the foghorns from the bay  
the indiscreet, fat and mournful sounds  
a trumpet played in low keys   
Alone and still lost  
but not lonely    


Over a fortnight or so into May  
The dogwood petals fade a little each day  
bruised by night mists  
bleached by the spring sun    


Books I read pile up on the desk  
Celine, Auden, Dickens, Woolf and Turgenev  
long turned to dust  
And I remain yet uninspired   

One morning a cold spring rain comes  
to douse the last flame of the dogwood  
All afternoon I watch  
the papery petals fall and scatter   
in a lazy drift of wet confetti    

Sweeping the million soggy petals     
my paralyzed and frozen mind thaws a little  
a tiny stir of excitement and anticipation  
maybe I will be able to write again  
more than five years after 9/11   
when for a moment I thought it might be my last day   
Crawling blindly  
through the warm gray dust of the pulverized tower  
that fell thickly blotting out the sun   

The memory and terror of the day  
still haunts and invades my dreams  
But I now possess the joy I never knew before  
And at last some semblance of peace  
in my first spring in Brooklyn    
a modest paradise of the exiled  


 




Even
before they could enter them
Like an irreversible dream,
Even before the invisible birds
Could turn the giant silver towers

Into
a shimmering mirage in the desert,
Could fall like giant metal tears
From an impossibly blue early morning sky,
And the concrete dust 

Could
bulge through the streets
  Like clouds of sand
In a new more terrible kind of desert,
A new more terrible kind of reality. 

The rooster
from the Wild West
Was already strutting on the world stage,
His dull feathers and even duller beak
Filled with retribution, evil doers, and "those folks"-

One wing
taking cover in the Midwest,
In the name of greater security,
  And the other launching a New Crusade
In behalf of the old Belt and Book-

And the
hen was hiding in his cave in the East,
Laying comfortably back on his well-manicured elbow,
Dictating into his microphone a 'holy' war, a new, still more Fundamental
moral imperative, this one from the Mideast-

Even
before the angels could finish falling
From the steel blue sky like birds on fire.
Now terrified by the external world
All of its internal struggles become outer ones;

And comparably
terrified
  By the inner ones, the exterior world
Becomes a stealthy black one.
Now we can all dance

A new
oily black Dance of Death
In the desert - the first but surely not the last
In the new millennium - in the monstrous name
Of freedom with a green back 

And a
god with a veiled face.
And we dance this dance
Even before the angels can finish falling
From the steel blue sky like birds on fire. 

 

 

 There
what will I find of you,
Expect to, your words like ice
Forming on a branch, the soul thawing 
In the moon's splayed thigh,


A
bridge like a lapsed heart, 
Snow the color of empty
sheets at dawn,
A river turning into a lost lover, 
And in the garden the sadness
of the open gate? 

And
what will I bring to you, after the gods, 
Can I, the memory of youth's
flower
Breaking at twilight, placed everywhere 
Like ashes upon a golden
threshold?


   
 

 

 

Al mara*
Like any woman I know
  Beats down the twitch
  Under her skin
  Tucks the frayed fibers
  Of her social mask
  Re-makes herself whole
  Into this world
  And begins to maul
  Her shroud of tender skin
  In order to “arrive”

  Her father sends her back
  Instructing her that the
  The difference between
Mara and girl is marriage
  So she shrugs with disdain
  Conceding to be a girl

  She wears a woolen gown to kill the winter and
  Imagining that its threads twist and spiral
  Into the earth,
  She stands upright
  Against the planting post
  And supports the sky
  Her head proof of all the world’s
  Boundaries

*The woman




My mother once painted over
    The furrow in my brow
With the blood
   Of a newly slaughtered sheep
    For a blessing of good health
    I never honored
   Not because I want to be sick
   But because I’m the type to like 
 The smell of my period
Better

The omen of blooming health
  I trade for a sniff
   Heady and solemn when
    I rock back with it like a
    Filled glass

   An intoxicant
   A logic heating
  A little space around me
 
An oven raising
   Its broken-shelled
Smear of smell
    Replacing a thousand blessings of good health
 I have not received 
Since I stood in front
  Of the slaughtered sheep



If you had eyes for me,
  I’d tempt a cup uplifted from a basin
  And give up my hands clean of
  Lifelines divined in small trousseaus

I play-act the streets for youSwagger with a bottle and
Slur, I’m a tirade now
I’m brave against my own eyes
And no more, “Give me my ‘proper’
Sometimes.”

 Then tonight / I saw myself years from nowA chronicle in phase one of your life
Falling carelesslyFrom the roof of your mouth
A woman in debt of sense enough to rollIn the dirt with another storyteller
A man drawing up a comical figureWashing herself and
Still clutching their towels that readHers and Mine.

 


At first, she only arrives
Cribbed from the memory
Of six brothers and sisters
   Which she tended, often
    With the slap of her plastic slippers
   Against their backsides

    The family said that my cousin is so white
    She is marriageable
    And carries bills in her pockets
    Even though she is not allowed
    To the gate of her house

    Up to her wedding day
    The white marble of her
    Skin remains pristine
    She is wordlessly taken to another house
    She calls her mother on the phone, crying
  The water has been turned off
    The garden spigot won’t even budge
    For her to wash the heavy bride makeup off her face
    She calls it omen, a marriage destined to drain her
    Hangs up on her mother
    Little else is known

    Yet now I often see her in my garden
    Continents away
    Walking toward me
    Like she never could on her father’s land
    I snap an aloe leaf in two
    And salve her browned leathery face
    Her salt-cracked mouth
    And watch her count her bills
    Before she crosses the garden into the street
    Me, waving
    Her, never looking back



Maybe
immortality will come calling on East 13th Street
And feel the
void left behind in the big loft
Maybe the bold flag-bearers for the beats
Will march tonight throughout Tibet
Maybe the Dalai Lama will proclaim your spirit as a Divine Entity Lion
of Dharma
How come you came to die so soon?
Love dies, body dies, flowers die
But the anarchistic spirit keeps growing
Last drink, last phone call, last joint
Last poem, last new moon like a withered white rose
The circle has closed
Now we are the flag-bearers with long hair for the hippie generation The
voice of the beatniks, of generations possessed
Now is the time for the post-beats, the freedom-obsessed
E=mc2 at 2:00 A.M., April 5, 1997
The hour of our discontent
The portals of heaven are opened by Buddha
It's hard to amend your untimely death, your brave song's end
The monks are chanting, led by Rimpoche
Aum Mane Padhme Aum
We read together at Chinese Chance, at St. Marks Church, at TNC And finally
at Huncke's memorial
Allen Ginsberg, you asked my friend, what is his name again? Pointing
towards me
Too late now,
My name is sitting Shiva, in sitting meditation
For the lion of the freedom
For the lion of New York 

 

I


      Sleepless sorrow. A dark swarm of visions.
      I have read the list of deadmen halfway through
      And I saw death: with a savage scythe,
      It was mowing down life in the middle of a plain.


      Not one flower on this field, not one bee.
      Only cinders and thistles.
      What am I to do with poor Ossian?
      How can I get some kind of answer?

Yesterday’s earth: death in your eye sockets,
      Black conscription, bottomless tombs.
      And the heart whines as never before
    And rings, like a bell that has cracked into pieces.


        II


        Sometimes snow leans on the left foot
        And sometimes it leans on the right:
        For a poet who has lost his freedom
        This actually means very little.


        Was it not he that leaned down to the impoverished
        Soil, and did not the soil take his measure
        For a nameless page, for a thousand
        Snow-white lilac blossoms overhead, falling? 




 



 


*

My arm
and the night
half around–this star
carried downstream

 lets
me rinse its light
beside those great rivers
the lame once every year

crawl
childlike, led–this star
still points and all the world
morning at last. I don't know when.

Every
stream is waiting
till another will flow from its side 

slightly
open, afraid to speak
holding my hand and its shadow

not yet
trampled by moss, by darkness
by sunken eddies and warts–my hand
blurred, limping to the riverside

–all
night though my bones don't soften
twisting even tighter–I never let on
the morning must know I'm here.



Leaving this would be easier
      if only the moonlight seemed
      false, the stars less real or true
    love less tangible as it is

    I will consider a life in some anonymous
    city, artificial and dreamlike,
    standing on a corner without a dime,
    fitting in with all the heartbroken

    dimeless others searching for solace
    in obscurity amid the lonely and the nameless.
    I’d go there to scatter these invisible ashes
    we buried in some forgotten place

    inside your heart. Still at 4 a.m. beneath
    these pulsing stars I cannot sleep,
    heart racing to follow or to stay or maybe just
    to find the final place of rest, beating

    with the stars and very much alone.
    I watch Orion chase his only desire
    until he falls from the face of the earth
    into another night, another's tormented

    darkness no closer to love. He persuades
    her no more than I persuade you, and again
    tonight my chest burns and aches embracing
    the persistence of this desire, one small star

    of seven even the giant with his glittering
    sword cannot touch. The best writers have said little
    so little solace in words. What more could I hope
    to do, how do I master this desire to go

    quietly into sleep when the day shuts down
    and stars come alive like neon in some
    fogbound city where the relevance of words
    weighs less than a cup of coffee,

    where a sad gray bird on the sidewalk
    offers a sweeter prayer than the priest,
    where lives disappear when no one calls,
    where the world is a dark room.




 


Windows whited, pinkybrown squat
Of the old Vincentians squares out 
To cricket field and March hedges. 

Sleepy city awaits its summer dreams, 


Distant car radio sums up the news 
To harveynorman and football scorelines. 
Somewhere someone dies suddenly, 
Colors of a life escape like quarkthings. 
Guess we've no Noah's ark to wait for us. 




If
you live a lie long

enough,
it will bear fruit 

and become
our own life, 

you'll
trail along the way 

 a cross
to be nailed on 

or a
hidden love life

will
grow into timber

for the
tree to hand from 

or the
beam holding up

the roof
over your lie. 

In the
end it matters

not much,
if you have taught 

your
body to resound 

forgiveness
and to transcend.

 

 


  While the talker talks
  you listen – the slight tilt
of your head
upon that pale

 stalk
of neck suggests
Goodness. Your eyes blink

 to
punctuate
  fine taste, that old 

code
of Lady. Trapped
by
the monologist, 

you
do not
protest–the civilized 

lie
protects you from
  what you want: that

 cigarette,
that
  highball, that

 bulge

  in black, pleated trousers

 across
the room.
Your crossed legs slowly 

cross
again, knees together, gingerly
shifting your hips as if 

fragile

  or dangerous. 



 

 

This city is an onerous lover
  Prone to drunken fits of homicidal rage
  This night a holocaust of transparency
  Disappearing into the alley’s wide open mouth
  Secret societies of the heart’s obsessions


    Plot treacherous love scenarios involving rib cages
    Hail, ballad of street discourse
    Night is singing me a sinister song
    Glossy muses wander in gossamer bird bones
    The whispered conversations of mind revive dead corners
    In which breed the hummingbird secret police
    Lost within the Cheshire carnival of the Port Authority
    Cassandra’s nocturne curse of syringe ambiance
    Lying in anger lays release
    Tongue cut by peccadillo, our streets bleed fluency
    In such a violent language

AirWaterEarthFire
  I see Vishnu in the eyes of passersby
  Bacchus in their lips
  His moon sign heart and mouth navigate as
  I secure the gates of my city
  No one enters and I remain alone

Hail Sodom’s opulent gutter madness
  Reverie to the mad girl moon riot raging
  As Cassandra is silently singing
  Kaleidoscope melting and night’s electric light
  Shifting, it is all unchanged, that is,
  It is all as before      

the postcard reads, my dear, dear Vishnu,
    oh, how I miss you
    this neon weather menaces all
    wholesome feeder mice dance in the halls
    dogs consume the ravaged body of summer
    rainbows shout over the howling echo
    within this place, I have transcended night
    impossibly senseless, inebriated,

And I am still in love with you…

 

 

 

 



Day after day passes
  and we do not lift a hand
  to defend ourselves.
  
  The enemy will storm the high tower?
    We leave a side-door unbolted.


      The enemy will starve us out?:
      We let the wheat rot
    in the few fields we control.


      The enemy will divide us?
      We hate the one we sleep with
      for touching us naked,
      for being like mother and father
      but with no distance,
      while the enemy is just a blur,
      a cricket, a cloud passing
    unless... until...


      Sometimes we imagine buckling on greaves
      or saddling the plumed destrier--
      sometimes the armor is brought before us
      in the order in which it would be girded on
      but no: take it away:
    it would chafe.. it smells of rancid oil...


      So we tell the future
      by haruspicy and bird flight.
      Truly the days have taken wing,
    the great flocks are leaving this kingdom--  


    quail, starling, passerine sparrow,
      even the birds of the open ocean,
      merganser, skua, jaeger, albatross,
      even the most solitary--snowy owls--
      wheeling over us in columns
    just to show us they are departing:


      the tea leaves smudge
      at the bottom of the cup,
    a die rolls under the armoire:


      but we have one prisoner
      whom we torture
    night after night,
    stripping him naked, dressing him  


      in a wimple and chemise,                
    beating him with the pommel,
      reviving him at the last moment
    with heal-all, saxifrage, hyssops--


      sometimes we let a rutting ram
      into his cell, and bind his hands..
    We do not stay to see what happens.


      We allow water to drip on him;
    what could be more kind than water..


      We barrage him with questions:
      who are the enemy?
      Are they ruthless?
      Do they have innumerable legions?
      Where are they deployed?
    Behind which tree?


      We interpret his sighs, his groans.
      Even under the hot iron
      he is absentminded,
    sometimes he blesses us...


      We argue among ourselves:
      a thousand thousand legions? No legions?
      A division? A regiment?
      Bivouacked in the wheat? The barley?
    The topless mountains?


      When he sleeps
      we listen with great longing
      to his sighs, his belches,
      his trembling, and record them all
    in a great leatherbound book--


      but days, days are the great enemy,
      our captive is growing old,
      his eyes are dimming,
    he complains of ringing in the ears,
      stiff joints, amnesia, a feeling
      of no longer being able to suffer--
      torments we played no part in--
    and we tremble: 


      when he dies we will live on
      at the whim of a mote of dust
      whirling in the last shaft of evening.






The clouds drop east to west
  Down these same Maui mountains
  Under them skirts of rain
Across the fields
  A line of dancers
  One dances to me   
Brushes my face
  Drops darken the open pages of my book   
  


  In the movie version
  When he carried her body to the plane
  You were so overcome    you clung and cried against me
  We were the last to leave the theater   
  


  I thank you for every word
  I’ve written these two years

Restless,unable
to sleep
Keys, bars, the guns being racked
Year after year
Endless echoes
of steel kissing steel

Noise

  Constant yelling
Nothing said
Vegetating faces, lost faces
dusted faces

A lifer

  A dreamer
Tomorrow's a dream
Yesterday's a memory
Both a passing of a cloud

How I
long
for the silence of a raindrop
falling gently to earth
  The magnificence of a rose
blooming into its many hues
of color
The brilliance of a rainbow
when it sweetly lights up the sky
after a pounding rainfall 

Picnics
in a rich green meadow
  We saw the beauty in butterflies
We made it our symbol
Tiny grains of sand
One hour glass
A tear that may engender
  a waterfall

The memories

  the dreams
are now
Love is now

There's
no beauty in cell bars

  poem 




  b-92377
  tamal, ca 94974 

  We lock ourselves up
not because
of the bars and
steel that surround us
not because life doesn't bend
to our every whim 

But,
because of the projections
  we place on our worlds
The judgments, the "I can'ts"
The thinking the world owes us a living
The trying to please everyone
  while not pleasing ourselves

By seeking
the beauty on the outside
that is surely within
For prisons are created internally
and are found everywhere

We allow
unreal and unnatural thoughts
to be our walls, our limits
Because of the dam we build to
stop universal love, the light

It's
all within our selves
this paradise you go to of beauty
and love
There's peace, where along with the eagle
you may soar
a place inside that was inspired
from the inner and above
which are one and the same

The world
may not bend
to your every whim
But, it will flow wherever
you want it to go.......... 

THERE'S
BEAUTY IN CELL BARS 








I
watched your soft fudge feet
and fresh dipped cherry toes dangle in the air.
They lisped to me tales of luxury
the earth, wind and fire in your kiss. 

My
love go if you must only leave
your smile to mend my heart
  your kiss on lips to heal my spirit
  your sweet voice to appease my soul. 

Instead
of an oak tree we carved
our names on a sandy beach
A wave washed them gently away
We are still there. 

A
swan cannot forget his wings
once he has flown and danced between clouds
I shall miss you and think of you
even dream of you. 

Your
skin so evenly ripe and our love
like gunpowder explodes in pure ecstasy.



I.
  What is this place
I am
in?
  One foot in darkness
  One foot in light?

What
is this place?
Where dark buzzards circle
morning, noon and night?

 What
is this place
  I am in?
  Where Amtrak trains whistle
  by on unseen tracks
on the other side of the mountains? 

II.

  I sit at the base of the light pole
All around me there are people
on the basketball court
Three Mexican-Americans are doing burpies
  listening to soft rock music on the radio. 

Across
the basketball court
multi-colored Christians come together
to pray to their God. 

While
African-Americans slap
dominoes on the concrete tables
behind me. 

I sit
at the light pole
reading Shakespeare.

just find me
  a smiling picture of him
  raucous

no blues

 

 

how mandarin rinds fell from your hands
  left holding naked fruit

how shameless lips danced the shape
  of each slice of flesh
  wholly stripped of any evidence
  that pith or bitter skin could obscure
  the sweet that lay within

it is impossible to deny that sense of longing
  for the things left unknown because
  we never knew they existed

had no reason to believe
  given the confines of our enlightenment
  that still more distant shores hid beyond
  still more distant seas

where young girls butchered
  rare fruits, watching the sun
  set beyond the Andes
  to where strange young boys
  consumed strange meats

EASY LOBSTER RABBIT:You will need a plate. You will need a saucepan. You will need two cans of Welsh rabbit. You'll need a can opener to open them because you're going to make Easy Lobster Rabbit. So you're going to need one 5- or 6-ounce can of lobster, cubed and drained. You're going to need mushrooms, 3 ounces of sliced broiled mushrooms. You're going to need a small pan with a handle. So you better have thatóthat little pan with the handle. You're going to need a small pan with a handle. You're going to need hot toast points. Okay, let's just recap really quickly, and just move things, really fast, fast as you can. You will need a small plate. You will need rabbit, lobster, mushrooms, white wine, hot toast points. A can opener. Dinner in 45 minutes? It's possible! Delicious? Of course! Mealtime, on time, will be no problem with Easy Rabbit Lobster.

    GA-GA-GAMES. Chess is one of the most DIFFICULT of all games to play. Each of the pieces has its own special way of moving. Another DIFFICULT game is bridge. There are over 50 cards and a good percentage of them have to be held in one hand so that your opponent doesn't see them. An Indian game called Gauntlet is ANOTHER DIFFICULT GAME TO PLAY.

    as superior to others, & know that the Euphrates is more than a long, flowing line 

    on a grade school map drawn in crayon!        




   



So much of the time, I exaggerate. 

The great is only good. The terrible, 

Downplayed, or dropped from

 

The story altogether. And nothing—

Nothing is said about words exhausted  

At the Sidewalk with Sam and Lois. 

 

But sometimes, a soon-to-be-night sky 

Descants itself into being much more 

Than expected. To hear hope’s angel 

 

Alone is one thing; but to witness

Them singing with you was almost 

Too much: goat-ragged hills, lavender,  

 

Hawks circling oaks, which rip up

To the sun—through whose columns

Finches fluttered, “My sister. My brother.”

 

   




One thought
  not of
  chair’s stance,
  position



in history’s
  climb, or
  seat, just
  where



to plop,
  not arm
  of excess,
  determination’s



might. Then
  prisoner
  in cell, in
  blood



and feces,
  huddled
  raging on
  floor.



First medicine
  a chair,
  prop him
  upright,



consolation
  in dignity
  position
  proper



to humanity
  swiftly
  excised,
  blank,



symbol,
  cure,
  tool, and
  right.
     
 




This is the one that will make him love me,

She said, holding up the fifth lace skirt,

Her eyes wider, darker in her face

Made of breath, and hair dyed black

To please 

Please, please him, who already loves 

 

Her when she takes off outer longings

And they turn to cats, rolling,

Furry, rowling, all inside the covers

Of each other, pull them off

 

Their heads, their scattered freckles, words.

 

See Through

Under the falling glances

Turning this way to be in one world,

That way to see another,

Each character getting on the train,

Chinese, or speaking loudly to Alone,

Those covered in the dream 

Made of commercial 

Sleight of hand,



Remain that which slides

Between the shifting levels,

Watery, transparent,

Icicles melting 

Too fast to break.

 

joined at the neck



i i  i i

how many times can we use the word i i i i 

enough that we become other other other,

the old mexican man on the train 

who chuckles from time to time

while continually playing his mandolin

with only broken strings 

crammed up together

along its neck in a rambunctious bundle,

as he sits so close to me his smell

becomes me, the boldly dissonant sounds resonate

as everyone looks at him annoyed,

and sees me smiling at the beauty--

Implicated!

Abandoned dock at
  night 

on the thigh of
  the Gualdaquiver. 

The grope of oars
  

bending branches
  of amber light,

 licking, cleaning,
  

the cerulean lens
  of the apparatus. 

 

All I can drink
  of this river 

is anarchy & wind,

 the pure tint of
  spirit

 whistling downstream,

 washing the imagination's
  laundry, 

drenching the turgid.
  

 

 The emotions of
  bashful lovers

 wade at the basin,
  

their hesitant sounds

 sinking into a
  single limb, 

capsizing perpetually
  

their vows of celibacy.
  

 

Sky turns 

from informant to
  secret. 

The truth so far
  away, 

the peace so near.
  

We all must drown
  someplace.

 I'm glad I do here.
  

 

The silver lamé looks good on you
the little black dress fits just right
you'll grow as it grows so,

can I have that black dress?

You are thirty-nine and very surprised
  you told the doctor you had a tumor

but the tumor has two eyes

and you are very surprised.
  How can this be at thirty-nine?

Just like it was when you were twenty-one.
  It was the forties so it wasn't your fault
honeymoon sheets hung on the line
so you stole away to New York
to figure it out yourself.

It was hard so you failed
after drinks at Jack Dempsey's
before breakfast at the Taft
Ella sang two sultry sets
you got her autograph but no information
arrived home sweaty happy blind
little black dress gathering
  in all the wrong places.

 


Christ must have followed
  you an old guy
  into the last standing house
  on Murder Street
  he has heart
  the drug dealer said
  the old guy has heart
  and he placed his hand on your back
  then you turned and took it
  and cuffed it and led him away

every time I hear Sinatra
  see a war movie
  read Ernest Hemmingway
  buy cigarettes
  eat alone with one hand
  covering both eyes
  I remember
  you the old guy
  me your little girl
  the number on the house
  the name of the street
  where we lived

 


I had
a fellowship, but lived poorly
  On slices of pizza.
  Later, a career of washing lettuce;
  but I have always been the same.
  It's a question of acquiring a mastery of tone
  Beneath the crystal chandeliers and champagne
  on a glass table top.
  At the age of five I thought Scarlett O'Hara
  a fictional character. It was not until
  The age of forty-eight I knew she was real.
  Old clothes and bedroom slippers and a scarf
  Wrapped around her head
  In low cost tenement housing.
  She began talking about my writing
  And her sex life.
  I'm curt by nature and dolorous.
  But I knew if I worked hard I'd eventually make it.



 

How many loves had I
  in young boy's bed,
  at Humarock, or Provincetown's
  Cape Cod, under sweating summer sun,

  after Land's End, before their interruption.
  How many loves had I?

  in discourse by firelight, after highballs
  to records of Marlene Dietrich and Cole Porter,
  how many loves had I?



  in Swampscott flat, or Beacon Hill house,
  Beacon Street garage or Fiedler overpass,
  how many loves had I?



  How many loves, in Annandale
  before payment or threat, in the Public Gardens
  or Fifth Avenue park, how many loves--

  None, none, none at all.



 

 

 

 

 

 


Poem For A Friend In Prison



hello
Joe
  I could handle the name change
but they keep transferring you
to so many different units
that I'm running out of space
in my address book
and now they're shuttling you
from prison to prison
I know this is America
but this is a bit too much
even for a pro like me
all these prisons being built
like factory assembly lines
I mean there's only so many
license plates one can make
makes no sense to me
  you ask how I'm doing
  which is kind of you
  given your own circumstances
  I'm confined to my own prison
even if there are no keepers
  where life has become a surreal movie
with nothing but bit actors
like those old sing-a-longs
they flashed on the movie screen
when I was a kid
follow the bouncing ball
but I can't and couldn't then
  carry a note
  it's a hard life brother
  on the inside on the outside
part of the problem lies with the
judges who must be poor mathematicians
when it comes to handing out time
and what the fuck is the world coming to
when poets shun writing for e-mail?
the old man down on Market Street
the one with no legs and a skateboard
has more balls than the President
this is a bitch of a poem
not a bitching poem
  I know you know the difference
  even if the jailer's don't
thirsting after your blood
like a junkie lab technician
stepping on over and around
dead bodies
looking for live spirits to bury
I wish I could tell you there's
light at the end of the tunnel
but there isn't
the new Governor believes
in Capital Punishment
as if death were a spanking
or being sent to bed without supper
I've got to get me a new dictionary
the one I have must have belonged
to Bill Clinton with all
its tortured definitions
the message of America
can't be found
on Mount Rushmore
it's written in blood at the Texas Book Depository
I know this guy who believes
if we reduce the world population
by a third and close our borders
there would be enough food
for everyone in the world
too much breeding he said
but this same man breeds
killer dogs and has five children
and another on the way
it's the kind of shit
that's driving me sane
just when I was getting the
insane part down to perfection
I feel like I'm the lone survivor
standing on the deck of the Titanic
destined to walk the ocean floor
with a fish womb reality
better watch it brother
you might get what
you wish for:
a new trial
a new judge a new jury
but would the outcome
be any different
The D.A. should wear
a black robe a wig and powder his cheeks
bend over and beg forgiveness
what's left of Eliot Ness' old gang
could take on the Wise Guys
outside the courthouse
hell, I might even buy a ticket
mouth a few obscenities
to take the edge off the hype
we are born we die
we spend time in between
be it behind or outside the walls
and the prisons keep getting built
and all I can do about it is write
these "bitching" poems to an audience
who does nothing but bitch
sometimes I think I ' m a retarded
space alien put here by a superior race
you on the inside me on the outside
  inner parts of a human computer waiting
  to be blinked from the screen 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 TO A YOUNG SWIMMER 




You could beat me in a race
  if you weren't afraid to
  come into the deep end.
  It's disorienting at first,
  the tortoiseshell patterns made by the light
  on all sides,
  not just the pool floor.

You slip weightless through the ether
but are tethered by fear.
I want to press on though
gravity's closing in.

See that stand of trees?
Beyond them lies the horror
of my adolescence.
I tried to drown my insecurities
in chlorinated silence,
hold my awkwardness under
till it turned blue.

I want to coax you out
but I see you are untroubled
by your limitations,
content to stay in the shallow end,
your loud pink sex toys bobbing
at the edge.

By the time I was your age
I was already swimming at all depths,
,pushed by a need
I am still trying to define.



 

Life (part II)


Every moment sacred
  every breath a blessing
  every thought, cognition, feeling - ecstacy.
  Since my world was turned upside-down
 under the glowing glare of headlights
and the scream of a friend,
  Freeway free-fall in McFarland, Wisconsin
where the cops are hot
and the medics are hotter.


    And I thought of myself in a porn flick:
“Why yes, officer, I’m concealing a weapon-
mayhaps you should frisk me...”
  Semi-delusional in my shocked zombie brain
  (80 to 0 in a flipped car’ll do that to ya)
  and almost waiting for the 3
  studly medics to begin stripping me
(“looking for injuries”)
as I sat, staring and silent
  in the ambulance
  trying as best as I could
to tune out the incessant, 
meaningless babble of my ex-boyfriend

(who’d been driving and seemed to have chosen the
“I’m-gonna-talk-about-anything-I-can-so-as-to
-belittle-and-avoid-the-trauma-of-destroying-my-
car-and-nearly-killing-myself-and-my-one-time-
lover-on-Interstate-90-in-podunk-backwoods-
Wisconsin” approach to coping).

Which had begun to grow repetitive,
not to mention inaccurate,
in his attempt to avoid responsibility -
claiming a mysterious gust of wind
(like a sneeze from God)
had taken control of the car
    from the erratic hands
and lead foot
of its driver.

 Meandering is an archive. Uncooked trivia. Maybe it will interest you. If you enjoy it, you might enjoy a visit to glia.ca Peace Pilgrim, An Extraordinary Life
Her Steps are succinct and practical and

are not to be taken in any certain order. The first step for one may be the last step for another. So just take whatever steps seem easiest for you and as you take a few steps it will become easier for you to take a few more (Peace Pilgrim, 1982, p.9).

There are four preparations:

* right attitude toward life.
* bringing our lives into harmony with the laws that govern this universe.
* finding one's special place in the universe through inner guidance.
* simplification of life.

There are four purifications:

* of body
* of thoughts
* of desires
* of motivations

There are four relinquishments:

* of self-will
* of the feeling of separateness
* of all attachments
* of all negative feelings (pp.9-20)

Peace gives further advice:  The path of gradual relinquishment...is a difficult path, for only when relinquishment is complete do the rewards really come. The path of quick relinquishments is an easy path, for it brings immediate blessings.  (p.21)
 


Kemeny Babineau 

The late sixties and early seventies saw Suknaski produce work for at least ten concrete poetry chapbooks (including two anthologies) while publishing many titles by others (Dennis Lee, Stephen Scobie, bp Nichol, Earle Birney, and Sid Marty, to name a few) as well with his own Elfin Plot Press. He floated poems and magazines rolled up in Al Purdy’s cigar tubes down the North Saskatchewan River. He folded an issue of Elfin Plot into paper airplanes and had them dropped from an aircraft flying north out of Edmonton. He buried others on mountaintops, or left them on beaches melted into tablet-like candles abandoned for strangers: something to light them home. It was undoubtedly actions like these that prompted Douglas Barbour’s wry comment that Elfin Plot was “the most underground of underground magazines.” The output during this time was frenetic, sprawling, brilliant, compulsive and voluminous, especially considering his transitory lifestyle and constant poverty.

No text is sacred. Nothing is ever for real. The earth shifts beneath our feet. We are walking in circles looking again and again at the same thing.
 

Davis (1996, emphasis added):

 I've gradually smoothed over this more radical [ontological panpsychic] stance by strategically adopting methodological views (Arjun Appadurai and Igor Kopytoff's cultural biographies of things, Stanley Fish's reader-response theory of literary meaning) that would enable me to tell my biographical stories, and would at the same time domesticate my living objects within acceptable Western intellectual approaches.  Biographies  thus becomes a strategic metaphor for narrating the historical processes that surround objects over time, rather than the dead serious, non-metaphorical telling of an actual life of an embodied iconic being. Yet I don't think that means that I entirely abandon my images to Western conceptualizations. In centering the book around stories, lives of individual objects that have led and continue to lead interesting and varied lives, I hope that there is a cumulative persuasive effect that I'm not using  lives  metaphorically or ironically, but as the expression of a serious ontological premise. My aim is that an accomodation between two different ideas of how images might in fact be alive will emerge over the course of the book.

 Military Malignancy
In Context: U.S. Military Spending Versus Rest of the World

Consider the following:

The above sources compare the given fiscal year budget request with the latest figures for other countries, which are sometimes two years old. Still using those statistics for other countries, however, a comparison can be made here of the US Fiscal Year 2005 spending against other equivalent data:

* The US military spending was almost two-fifths of the total.
* The US military spending was almost 7 times larger than the Chinese budget, the second largest spender.
* The US military budget was almost 29 times as large as the combined spending of the six “rogue” states (Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria) who spent $14.65 billion.
* It was more than the combined spending of the next 14 nations.
* The United States and its close allies accounted for some two thirds to three-quarters of all military spending, depending on who you count as close allies (typically NATO countries, Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan and South Korea)
* The six potential “enemies,” Russia, and China together spent $139 billion, 30% of the U.S. military budget.

Some of the above statistics come from organizations such as the Center for Defense Information, and the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. They often include a global comparison. The one for Fiscal Year 2007 has been produced as a graph here:

 On Lionel Kearns -
vispo 

He is a Linguist. Which is interesting because one of the reasons I became so excited about his work is he seems to understand that there has been a synthesis going on, over the last seventy years, more or less commencing with the work of Godel and Turing, between number and language, between mathematics and language studies, between the arts and sciences, between any pair of fields that code their material in such a way that it can be turned into information. Kearns is a language man. Kearns is a real thinker. Kearns is a media man. Kearns is a polyartist. Kearns has been contemporary since the mid sixties. I can't think of any other poets from around here except maybe bp Nichol who might have written anything in the sixties about digital poetics and issues.
 Kali's Child 

Also relevant here is the manner in which my dialectical category of  the erotic  has been misread by some as flatly monodimensional, as if it meant simply  sex,  when in fact the erotic only begins with physical sexuality and moves out (really  up ) from there into the sublime,  sublimated  realms of symbolic vision, mystical experience, mythology and theology. I could, no doubt, address such a misunderstanding in the same way that Freud answered his own critics. In an effort to show that his own concept of  libido  was not the  outrageous innovation  that people supposed it to be, the analyst called attention to how sexuality lay in an unbroken continuum with the  higher aims  of  love for parents and children, friendship and love for humanity in general, and also devotion to concrete objects and to abstract ideas." "All these tendencies,  Freud writes,  are an expresson of the same instinctual impulses. 13 Then, as if to move even higher  up  along the continuum, Freud invokes--appropriately, I would argue--the erotic mysticism of Plato and the love theology of Paul:  In its origin, function, and relation to sexual love,  he wrote,  the 'Eros' of the philosopher Plato coincides exactly with the love-force, the libido of psycho-analysis . . . and when the apostle Paul, in his famous epistle to the Corinthians, praises love above all else, he certainly understands it in the same 'wider' sense. 14
 adi da
AVATAR ADI DA SAMRAJ: There is a fundamental fear of being without a world. You are constantly servicing the impulse to always have a world and also to have that world be basically comfortable.

That impulse underlies all forms of  cosmic religion  — or the religion of preserving beings in the cosmic domain, of granting everybody a world and making the world more and more congenial by at least getting rid of darker influences.

The  Perfect Practice  of the Way of Adidam, however, is not about  having a world . It is about entering into the Domain That Is Prior to the cosmic domain.

People generally do not have the disposition for such a practice. As long as there is identification with the body-mind, you do not want there to be no world. In fact, you insist that there be a world — and that it be congenial to you. Therefore, you will not relinquish your world.

In other words, you will not accept the Position you are actually in, the Position That Transcends the conditional (or cosmic) domain, until your craven attachment to the body-mind (and, therefore, to having a world that is congenial) relaxes profoundly, such that you know the world for what it is and (thereby) realize a native detachment.

Then the  Perfect Practice  can begin.

Words Made Flesh
WORDS MADE FLESH
Code, Culture, Imagination
Florian Cramer

A b s t r a c t: Executable code existed centuries before the invention of the computer in magic, Kabbalah, musical composition and experimental poetry. These practices are often neglected as a historical pretext of contemporary software culture and electronic arts. Above all, they link computations to a vast speculative imagination that encompasses art, language, technology, philosophy and religion. These speculations in turn inscribe themselves into the technology. Since even the most simple formalism requires symbols with which it can be expressed, and symbols have cultural connotations, any code is loaded with meaning. This booklet writes a small cultural history of imaginative computation, reconstructing both the obsessive persistence and contradictory mutations of the phantasm that symbols turn physical, and words are made flesh.

Autopoesis 

Autopoesis

Autopoesis is both a concept about self-maintaining systems, especially biological ones, and an epistemological theory about cognition and self-reference.

Humberto Maturana and F. J. Varela proposed the concept of autopoesis (as opposed to allopoetic) as the organization of living things, which maintains their lasting unity and wholeness in the midst of continual turnover of constituents, specifically through self-production. For them, autopoesis is the necessary and sufficient condition for the minimal units of life. Autopoesis defines the minimal mechanistic features of the simplest possible living entity. It describes  how life works.  All living systems are autopoetic, and all physical systems, if autopoetic, can be said to be living.

Physicist Freeman Dyson of the Institute for Advanced Study estimates that, within 200 years or so, we should attain Type I status. In fact, growing at a modest rate of 1% per year, Kardashev estimated that it would take only 3,200 years to reach Type II status, and 5,800 years to reach Type III status. Living in a Type I,II, or III civilization

For example, a Type I civilization is a truly planetary one, which has mastered most forms of planetary energy. Their energy output may be on the order of thousands to millions of times our current planetary output.

It looks like a four-armed starfish, but so far it's unaware of its own shape. After flailing its arms for a while, however, the robot gets a sense of its design and begins to walk. The real feat comes when engineers remove a part of its leg: The robot senses a change in its structure and begins walking in a different way to compensate. The demonstration is the first proof that a robot can generate a conception of itself and then adapt to damage, a handy skill to have in unpredictable environments.

The image before me when I mention your name is that of a gorilla with a heart of gold. I don't hesitate to add immediately that this name which you have chosen to mask your multi-faceted soul has become an obsession with me. It suggests cold dynamite lying carelessly on a beautiful lawn where children play at croquet with iron mallets. It suggests a perfidy so transparent as to become magnetic.

The rhizome is that which:  connects any point to any other point, and its traits are not necessarily linked to traits of the same nature; it brings into play very different regimes of signs, and even nonsign states... It is composed not of units but of dimensions, or rather directions in motion. It has neither beginning nor end, but always a milieu from which it grows and which it overspills... The rhizome proceeds by variation, expansion, conquest, capture, offshoots... the rhizome pertains to a map that... is always detachable, connectable, reversible, modifiable, and has multiple entryways and exits

Remote Control Device 'Controls' Humans 

Nippon Telegraph Telephone Corp., Japans top telephone company, says it is developing the technology to perhaps make video games more realistic. But more sinister applications also come to mind.

I can envision it being added to militaries' arsenals of so-called  non-lethal  weapons.

A special headset was placed on my cranium by my hosts during a recent demonstration at an NTT research center. It sent a very low voltage electric current from the back of my ears through my head _ either from left to right or right to left, depending on which way the joystick on a remote-control was moved.

I found the experience unnerving and exhausting: I sought to step straight ahead but kept careening from side to side. Those alternating currents literally threw me off.

The technology is called galvanic vestibular stimulation _ essentially, electricity messes with the delicate nerves inside the ear that help maintain balance.

Andy Goldsworthy on Transience 

 At its most successful, my 'touch' looks into the heart of nature; most days I don't even get close. These things are all part of a transient process that I cannot understand unless my touch is also transient-only in this way can the cycle remain unbroken and the process be complete.  -Andy Goldsworthy

Paint me a computer 

 Chemists in Poland have constructed logic gates, the ‘atoms’ of computation, out of well-known pigments.

Konrad Szacilowski and colleagues at the Jagiellonian University in Krakow have made chemical switches out of titanium dioxide and Prussian blue, which are both commonly used paint pigments. The switches can replicate the basic logical operations in digital circuits.

Climate 

 On a scale of thousands of years, we are due for a steep drop in temperature as we enter another ice age. This could start next week or not for a thousand years, we do not know.

On a scale of hundreds of years, we are at or possible past a peak of a 500-600 year cycle. This cycle appears to be associated with the rise and fall of major civilisations.

Beneath the Metadata: Some Philosophical Problems with Folksonomy 

 A philosophy of relativism allows folksonomy to draw on many users with various perceptions to classify a document instead of relying on one individual cataloger to set the index terms for that item...Therefore, a folksonomy universe allows both true and false statements to coexist.

 There are rare historical moments when developments in numerous fields enter a period of similar qualitative change before diverging into a multiplicity of new terms. Few of those who live through such a moment can grasp the full significance of what is happening. But all are aware of change: the future, instead of offering continuity appears to advance toward them.

Innovation Lab ::: The World's first screen to be made of concrete 

 The screen consists of concrete with embedded optical fibres, arranged as pixels, capable of transmitting natural as well as artificial light. The light-admission points are on the back of the screen where the fibres are positioned. The light, or the picture, will then be displayed in pixels on the front. The light source can be a projector emitting either pictures or film footage. In principle, the screen is capable of acting as a window since – owing to the combination of the screen concept's light-absorption and optical cables – it has a capacity for transmitting natural light.

epigenetics --Endocrinology (Journal) 

 Transient exposure of a gestating female rat during the period of sex determination to the endocrine disruptor vinclozolin (ie anti-androgenic endocrine disruptor used as a fungicide in the fruit industry) induced an adult phenotype in the first F1 generation of breast tumors, prostate disease, kidney disease, immune abnormalities and premature aging. These adult onset diseases were transferred through the male germ-line to 85% of all males of all subsequent generations examined (ie F1-F4).   

In other words, pollution's effects on the body can be inherited. It's called epigenetics.

What Is an Event? 

 ...with Leibniz the question surges forth in philosophy that will continue to haunt Whitehead and Bergson: not how to attain eternity, but in what conditions does the objective world allow for a subjective production of novelty, that is, of creation? The best of all worlds had no other meaning: it was neither the least abominable nor the least ugly, but the one whose All granted a production of novelty, a liberation of true quanta of  private  subjectivity, even at the cost of the removal of the damned. The best of all worlds is not the one that reproduces the eternal, but the one in which new creations are produced, the one endowed with a capacity for innovation or creativity: a teleological conversion of philosophy.

Dust, fertilization and sources 

  The winter Bodélé dust is carried over the populated regions of west Africa where it can be affected by smoke and urban pollution before it continues transport over the Atlantic and towards Amazonia. Although Koren et al do not speculate on the chemical possibilities in their paper, the interaction between the dust and the pollutants provides opportunity for acids to coat the dust particles and to mobilize the iron compounds, creating a highly efficient fertilizing agent for ocean phytoplankton and the biota of the Amazon forest. Koren et al do quantify the dust emission of the Bodélé depression, estimating that this small area produces approximately 50% of the Saharan dust deposited in the Amazon.

 Along the way and finally, from 1969 through 1971, she drew up propositions, just handwriting on paper, for pieces that were simply to be acted out rather than produced in any material form, including the demise of her own career in the art world. These included Thinking Offer, Fascist Experiment, Dialogue Piece, Grass Piece, No Grass Piece, Masturbation Investigation, General Strike, Give Up Publicity, Thinking Abt. Form and Content, Lozano Emergency T S Fund, and I Have No Identity. There was to be no record of the dialogues, and there isn't, over the last 27 years of Lozano's life in Dallas, Texas, where she moved from New York in 1972.

Th Illusion of Conscious Will 

Daniel Wegner:  How do people come to understand their actions as their own? Common sense tells us we know when actions are ours because we have caused them; we are intrinsically informed of what we do by our conscious will. But it turns out people can be mistaken about their own authorship....people will feel they are the source of action when they think about that action in advance of its occurrence, and alternative sources of the action are not known. This theory calls into question the common sense view that conscious will is the cause of action.

(Pores 4) 

How and why do the ways of reading poetry in the UK that are most publicly visible still exclude work that is aesthetically and linguistically radical? What is the history of these models of reading poetry, and what is their relationship to marketing? What are the key sites of influence and how do they work (as cultural practices and as forms of power)? Why have recent moves, for example in Poetry Review, to give some recognition to the range of British poetries aroused such hostile responses? What is at stake? What are the possibilities for real change? What types of writing and publishing are offering alternative economies of reading to those that postmodern capitalism benefits from?

Fragments from the Library 

 As the circuit supplants the printed page, and as more and more of our communications involve us in network processes 
which of their nature plant us in a perpetual present 
our perception of history will inevitably alter. .... we meet the past as much in the presentation of words in books of specific vintage as we do in any isolated fact or statistic. The database, useful as it is, expunges this context, this sense of chronology, and admits us to a weightless order in which all information is equally accessible.

It is a flexible and continuous mass, woven tight like a fabric with neither rips nor darned patches, a multitude of quantified heroes who lose names and faces as they become the ciphered river of the street, a mobile language of computations and rationalities that belong to no one.

The Prometheus Society Articles The Outsiders

 His name was William James Sidis, and his IQ was estimated at between
250 and 300 [8, p. 283]. At eighteen months he could read The
New York Times, at two he taught himself Latin, at three he learned
Greek. By the time he was an adult he could speak more than forty
languages and dialects. He gained entrance to Harvard at eleven,
and gave a lecture on four-dimensional bodies to the Harvard Mathematical
Club his first year. He graduated cum laude at sixteen, and became
the youngest professor in history. He deduced the possibility
of black holes more than twenty years before Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar
published An Introduction to the Study of Stellar Structure.....Of all the prodigies for which there are records, his was probably the most powerful intellect of all. And yet it all came to nothing. He soon gave up his position as a professor, and for the rest of his life wandered from one menial job to another. His experiences as a child prodigy had proven so painful that he decided for the rest of his life to shun public exposure at all costs.

ABSTRACT... the ESP Game, described in this talk, is an enjoyable online game -
many people play over 40 hours a week -
and when people play, they help label images on the Web with descriptive keywords. These keywords can be used to significantly improve the accuracy of image search. People play the game not because they want to help, but because they enjoy it.

I describe other examples of  games with a purpose : Peekaboom, which helps determine the location of objects in images, and Verbosity, which collects common-sense knowledge. I also explain a general approach for constructing games with a purpose.

  Adventurous is not experimental. Experimental belongs to the laboratory. Adventure to life. Much of recent art has been merely experimental. It tries poetry with first one element then another omitted. I leaves out the head. Then it is too emotional. It leaves out the heart. Then it is too intellectual. It leaves out the feet. Then it is free verse. Adventure ends in the poorhouse. Experiment ends in the madhouse. Water spout theory of learning from above down from below up till it meets.

Tortuga :: Chapter 2. Art and Consciousness 

One of the outstanding features of civilization is the antagonism that develops between what comes to be called science and art. The former term literally means  knowledge ; the latter,  a way of doing things. 

If wisdom is the union of these two, their separation implies a loss of meaning,
a fall into absurdity.

organic information design 
ben fry 

 Design techniques for static information are well understood, their descriptions and discourse thorough and well-evolved. But these techniques fail when dynamic information is considered. There is a space of highly complex systems for which we lack deep understanding because few techniques exist for visualization of data whose structure and content are continually changing. To approach these problems, this thesis introduces a visualization process titled Organic Information Design. The resulting systems employ simulated organic properties in an interactive, visually refined environment to glean qualitative facts from large bodies of quantitative data generated by dynamic information sources.

Perception abstract 

 Oliver Sacks observed autistic twins who instantly guessed the exact number of matchsticks that had just fallen on the floor, saying in unison “111”. To test the suggestion that normal individuals have the capacity for savant numerosity, we temporarily simulated the savant condition in normal people by inhibiting the left anterior temporal lobe of twelve participants with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). This site has been implicated in the savant condition. Ten participants improved their ability to accurately guess the number of discrete items immediately following rTMS and, of these, eight became worse at guessing as the effects of the pulses receded. The probability of as many as eight out of twelve people doing best just after rTMS and not after sham stimulation by chance alone is less than one in one thousand.

 The idea of notation implies, if not demands, performance. Virtually any form of writing is a kind of notation and any form of reading is a type of performance. Poetry is an intensely physical art, one that activates several senses at once. In aural societies poetry has traditionally been accompanied by facial movement, gesture, manipulation of symbolic objects, the drawing and painting of figures, the wearing of costumes, etc. -
all of which, in a tribal context, are read. Poetry still is a physical art using multiple senses: the body as a whole equals or sometimes replaces the voice in performance art, and even silent readers turn pages, move their heads, their eyes, the roots of their tongues if not their tongues and lips, and so forth. 
 Three Visual Litterateurs

 We are coming to recognize visual literature as a distinct genre whose measure is simply the visual enhancement of language. Once the concept of a distinct genre is in mind, we can acknowledge that visual literature can appear in many media, only one of which is books....

  Academic poetry is intelligent but dull; non-academic poetry is dopey but exciting. Fair or not, that's been the rule of thumb for at least half a century, and generally speaking it's suited everyone just fine.

If not because grief or joy 

Has seized you. Why read

Theories of Media Change: Understanding New Media 
Garnet Hertz 

 Towards the end of his life, McLuhan and his son Eric embarked on a project to update the 1964 Understanding Media in response to his critics' requests to provide a solid basis for his drastic and metaphoric claims; the result was Laws of Media: The New Science , published by his son eight years after Marshall's death. Laws of Media defines a general theory of media change, constructing a tetrad model with four characteristics of media-in-transition: extension, obsolescence, reversal and retrieval.

Culture and the Individual 
Thanks to language and culture, human behavior can be incomparably more intelligent, more original, creative and flexible than the behavior of animals, whose brains are too small to accommodate the number of neurons necessary for the invention of language and the transmission of accumulated knowledge. But, thanks again to language and culture, human beings often behave with a stupidity, a lack of realism, a total inappropriateness, of which animals are incapable.[Aldous Huxley.

An ear has been surgically constructed on his arm. The intention with this soft prosthesis is to wirelessly connect it to the internet to enable it to become a listening device for remote others. Stelarc considers the ear prosthesis not as a sign of physical malfunction, but rather as a symbol for an additional feature 
not a sign of loss but rather a symptom of excess. Thus he tries to amplify the forms and functions of the human body, exposing its obsolescence and producing a human-machine-hybrid which questions the notion of the architecture, engineering and operation of the human body.

[Source: Wands, B. (2006). Art of the Digital Age. London: Thames & Hudson. ] C. John Holcombe :  And the relevance to literature? It may be that poems themselves are strange attractors. There are many similarities. Poems organize themselves. The writer submits words to the embryonic arrangement of the poem — a phrase, a conjectured verse form, intellectual argument, controlling emotion — but thereafter the poem takes over, creating an arrangement of words that is not easily changed. Poets often produce cycle of poems, recognizable in theme and form, but differing slightly from poem to poem. Literary periods also see these cycles of creation: a common technique or subject matter or Zeitgeist. Strange attractors have exactly these properties: similarities but not repetitions, an independence, a reluctance to shift far from their previous shape and position. 

The explicative potency of non-linear dynamics applied to poetry is well-established.

 ...literature is too multi-faceted, rambunctious, and iconoclastic to fit the limits of any definition... Literary theory does continue to be a central part of the practice of many postlanguage poets, yet they tend to undertake it with an ambivalent and often wearied eye....Thus, while narrative, lyric, spirituality, and a poetics of the everyday appear often as elements that language poets think should be rejected, postlanguage poets such as Juliana Spahr, Susan Smith Nash, Jefferson Hansen, Liz Willis, Peter Gizzi, Chris Stroffolino, Jennifer Moxley, Joe Ross, Lisa Jarnot, myself and many others have been consciously using one or several of these elements in their work, without returning to the sort of naive justifications of those elements that continue to be a feature of more mainstream American poetry.

 I weep over my imperfect pages, but if future generations read them, they will be more touched by my weeping than by any perfection I might have achieved, since perfection would have kept me from weeping and, therefore, from writing. The saint weeps, and is human. God is silent. That is why we can love the saint but not God.

 The physical fact of language --uttered, inscribed, marked, or frozen in front of our faces in the cold light of bitter days -
reminds us that there is no communication without the phatic exchange of substances.

A prophylactic attitude attempts to protect the imagination from direct encounters with the world as the tongue, the hand, the arm, the fist around the pen, the fingers on the keyboard all reach into the heavy flesh of matter and are rewarded by the sensate experience.

 I believe there is simply ourselves, and where we are has a particularity which we'd better use because that's about all we've got...there is no other culture.

The sooner we pave the way to positive change, the less traumatic will be the transformation and the smaller its human, economic and ecological cost.

The pictograph for  water  pronounced nu became the symbol for the consonantal sound of N.; This practice of using a pictograph to stand for the first sound in the word it stood for is called acrophony and was the first step in the development of an ALPHABET or the  One Sign-One sound  system of writing.
 
Technologies of Writing
 The phrase 'technologies of writing' refers not to the script or alphabet, the calligraphic or marking system that a text employs, but to the practical methods by which these systems are applied—pencil, brush, quill, ink, paint, print, machine key and pixel—and to the material surfaces and sites of writing itself—clay, animal skin, parchment, linen, wood pulp and cyberspace. 
 
 The invention of writing is probably the most important tool for human advancement, making it possible for each new generation to build upon the work of the previous, to transmit knowledge from person to person, across cultures and time.

 You have been searching for us without knowing it, following oblique references in crudely xeroxed marginal  samsidat  publications, crackpot mystical pamphlets, mail order courses ... a paper trail and a coded series of rumors spread at street level ... and the propagation of certain acts of insurrection against the Planetary Work Machine and the Consensus Reality ... or perhaps through various obscure mimeographed technical papers on the edges of  chaos science  ... through pirate computer networks ... or even through pure synchronicity and the pursuit of dreams. In any case we know something about you, your interests, deeds and desires, works and days ... and we know your address. Otherwise...you would not be reading this...

 A man of my occupation seldom claims a systematic mode of thinking; at worst, he claims to have a system 
but even that, in his case, is borrowing from a milieu, from a social order, or from the pursuit of philosophy at a tender age. Nothing convinces an artist more of the arbitrariness of the means to which he resorts to attain a goal 
however permanent it may be 
than the creative process itself, the process of composition.  (Nobel Lecture. 1987)

 How might new technologies and the metaphors of science be employed in the education of the artist? How might the insights of the artist contribute to the advancement of knowledge in science and to technological development? (Ask not what science can do for art but what art can do for science!). How can the accrued wisdom of exotic or ancient cultures be allied to the search for meaning and values in a post-biological society? How might new technologies serve to support and sustain cultures that lie beyond the Western paradigm? How might the Net serve the needs of interactive, non-linear, transdisciplinary learning, and engender creative thought and constructive action?

  A single, socially stressful situation can kill off new nerve cells in the brain region that processes learning, memory, and emotion, and possibly contribute to depression, new animal research shows.

Researchers found that in young rats, the stress of encountering aggressive, older rats did not stop the generation of new nerve cells-the first step in the process of neurogenesis. But stress did prevent the cells, located in the hippocampus, from surviving, leaving fewer new neurons for processing feelings and emotions.

 MAKING PROFOUND ART  by Andrew Wielawski 
These were the words of the Dreamer, who told me that the future doesn’t exist, because it hasn’t happened yet, and the past is gone. The world as we know it doesn’t exist, either, because it is only our own projection of chemical electrical impulses onto the screen of our brains. It is not the events as they happened, only a time delayed and heavily filtered rendition of them.

With a philosophical view like this, it is only a matter of taking things one step further to see how much freedom we have through our art.
 
And burnt up by love of beauty, 
I shall not have the splendid honour

How to Write a Scientific Paper 

Abstract

We (meaning I) present observations on the scientific publishing process

which (meaning that) are important and timely in that unless I have more

published papers soon, I will never get another job. These observations

are consistent with the theory that it is difficult to do good science, write

good scientific papers, and have enough publications to get future jobs.

Neuron : Cortex in Reading :Visual Word Focus Area
 Surgery removed a small portion of word-responsive occipitotemporal cortex overlapping with the word-specific fMRI activation. The patient developed a marked reading deficit, while recognition of other visual categories remained intact. Furthermore, in the post-surgery fMRI map of visual cortex, only word-specific activations disappeared. Altogether, these results provide direct evidence for the causal role of the left occipitotemporal cortex in the recognition of visual words.

Algorithmic Improvisations on the 74 Unique Words of Gadji Beri Bimba
  Friends of Orbit Bright – a racistly-white parody site promoting chewing gum and chastity (sex!). Painfully obvious perpetual brand placements. It's aimed at (post-)tweeners who believe in god but want to get laid. Outlook Theatre – a car made glamorous through association with video vignettes of a perfect family and immaculate romantic moments. Light fluffy and efficient consumer waltz. It's aimed at the wife archetype who wishes she could drive away. UFC66 – an Ultra fighting championship labyrinth full of snarling warriors and big time money. It's aimed at soldiers, the dispossessed and anyone who needs to fight just to survive. The myth of a champion is needed only by the defeated and oppressed.

 By their very nature as a real-time medium, action video games penalize the player who stops to reflect. Indeed, no real-time medium—including film, television, and radio—permits time to reflect (28). The one communication technology that does provide time to reflect is the written word...Whereas reading is associated with reflection, television is associated with impulsivity... there is evidence that visual technology inhibits imaginative response.

  Conjecture : Information-Sucking Reflex
 Alongside the innate physical sucking reflex for obtaining milk to be digested, decomposed and used all over the body for growth, repair, and energy, there is a genetically determined information-sucking reflex, which seeks out, sucks in, and decomposes information, which is later recombined in many ways, growing the information-processing architecture and many diverse recombinable competences. Our educational system and other factors (e.g. mind-binding cultures) often interfere with this process, unfortunately.
A big mistake made by governments and educational theorists is to assume that there's a right order in which to grow the architecture, etc. A system building a complex structure may have to assemble different substructures in a sequence that is opportunistic and ideosyncratic. Educational systems that do not allow for this can do a lot of damage through excessive regimentation, e.g. based on use of 'targets'.

A skeuomorph is a design feature, no longer functional in itself, that refers back to an avatar that was functional at an earlier time. The dashboard of my Toyota Camry, for example, is covered by vinyl molded to simulate stitching; the simulated stitching alludes back to a fabric that was in fact stitched, although it no longer serves that function in my car. Skeuomorphs visibly testify to the social or psychological necessity for innovation to be tempered by replication.

 ...a statistically significant property has been reported about the organization of human language. In spite of the huge number of words that can be stored by a human, any word in the lexicon can be reached with fewer than three intermediate words, on average.

...the graph connecting words in language shows the same statistical features as other complex networks. The short distance between words arising from the SW[Small World] structure indicates that language evolution might have involved the selection of a particular arrangement of connections between words.

If the SW features derive from optimal navigation needs... words the main purpose of which is to speed-up navigation must exist... According to our calculations, the 10 most connected words are `and’, `the’, `of ’, `in’, `a’, `to’, `’s’, `with’, `by’ and `is’. These words are characterized by a very low or zero semantic content.

 Much of the novel's alleged power is embedded in the line, that compulsory author-directed movement from the beginning of a sentence to its period, from the top of the page to the bottom, from the first page to the last. Of course, through print's long history, there have been countless strategies to counter the line's power, from marginalia and footnotes to the creative innovations of novelists like Laurence Sterne, James Joyce, Raymond Queneau, Julio Cortazar, Italo Calvino and Milorad Pavic, not to exclude the form's father, Cervantes himself. But true freedom from the tyranny of the line is perceived as only really possible now at last with the advent of hypertext, written and read on the computer, where the line in fact does not exist unless one invents and implants it in the text.

Born in 1870 in Brno, Moravia, his stonemason father died when he was only nine. A rebellious, disorientated boy, he failed in various attempts to get through architecture school. Contracting syphilis in the brothels of Vienna, by 21 he was sterile and in 1893 his mother disowned him. He went to America and for three years and did odd jobs in New York, somehow finding himself in that process and returning to Vienna in 1896 a man of taste and intellectual refinement, immediately entering the fashionable Viennese intelligentsia. His friends included Ludwig Wittgenstein, Arnold Schönberg, and Karl Kraus. He quickly established himself as the preferred architect of Vienna’s cultured bourgeoisie. Diagnosed with cancer in 1918, his stomach, appendix and part of his intestine were removed. For the rest of his life he could only digest ham and cream. He had several unhappy marriages. By the time he was fifty he was almost completely deaf; in 1928 he was disgraced by a paedophilia scandal and at his death in 1933 at 63 he was penniless[2]. He died in Kalksburg near Vienna.

 I've mentioned inspiration. Contemporary poets answer evasively when asked what it is, and if it actually exists. It's not that they've never known the blessing of this inner impulse. It's just not easy to explain something to someone else that you don't understand yourself.  ( 1996. Nobel Lecture )
  

Holding a miniature video camera, on one side of each suitcase in Carry On is mounted a two axis robotic arm. The live video feed from this camera is displayed on a LCD screen mounted on the other side of the suitcase. Every couple of minutes, the robots change the position of the cameras, thus changing what is being displayed in the LCD screens. Lacking image analysis of any kind or other sensory capability, these suitcases blindly look about, never understanding what they see.

 March 26–July 7, 2008, MOMA
Featuring works that transform books through a variety of mediums, Book/Shelf stresses an expanded notion of the illustrated book. The exhibition begins with a documentation of Marcel Duchamp's Unhappy Readymade (1919)—a work created when the artist, while traveling, asked his sister back home to hang a geometry book on his balcony in order to let the wind flip and tear the pages. It continues with works in which artists appropriate books by others, such as a sculpture by Martin Kippenberger made partly of books, and a copy of Duchamp's catalogue raisonné rebound by David Hammons under the title Holy Bible. Artists who tackle the idea of books in film (William Wegman), sound works (On Kawara), prints (Edward Ruscha), and drawings (Steve Wolfe) are represented as well. Finally, the exhibition surveys a number of artists who have created installations that display books in public contexts, including Brian Belott, Allen Ruppersberg, Josh Smith, and Lawrence Weiner.

littleBits is an opensource library of discrete electronic components pre-assembled in tiny circuit boards. Just as Legos allow you to create complex structures with very little engineering knowledge, littleBits are simple, intuitive, space-sensitive blocks that make prototyping with sophisticated electronics a matter of snapping small magnets together. With a growing number of available modules, littleBits aims to move electronics from late stages of the design process to its earliest ones, and from the hands of experts, to those of artists, makers and designers.

Apocalypse now
This new age, they explain, is defined both by the heating trend (whose closest analogue may be the catastrophe known as the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum, 56 million years ago) and by the radical instability expected of future environments. In somber prose, they warn that  the combination of extinctions, global species migrations and the widespread replacement of natural vegetation with agricultural monocultures is producing a distinctive contemporary biostratigraphic signal. These effects are permanent, as future evolution will take place from surviving (and frequently anthropogenically relocated) stocks.  Evolution itself, in other words, has been forced into a new trajectory.

 Collected Essays(part19)
That grisly thing, a “poetry reading”, is what it is because there will always be some among the audience who are bored or all but frankly hostile and who can’t remove themselves by the simple act of turning a knob. And it is at bottom the same difficulty—the fact that a theatre audience is not a selected one—that makes it impossible to get a decent performance of Shakespeare in England. On the air these conditions do not exist. The poet FEELS that he is addressing people to whom poetry means something, and it is a fact that poets who are used to broadcasting can read into the microphone with a virtuosity they would not equal if they had a visible audience in front of them. The element of make-believe that enters here does not greatly matter. The point is that in the only way now possible the poet has been brought into a situation in which reading verse aloud seems a natural unembarrassing thing, a normal exchange between man and man: also he has been led to think of his work as SOUND rather than as a pattern on paper. By that much the reconciliation between poetry and the common man is nearer. It already exists at the poet’s end of the aether-waves, whatever may be happening at the other end.
 
Poetry interests me above all as a kind of resistence. In the first place because its economy is absolutely aberrant to contemporary logic: an enormous investment (in terms of time and energy), quasi-nil effect and zero profitability. So it’s an act that could only be directed by internal necessity...

 Teemu Ikonen: Moving text in avant-garde poetry. Towards a poetics of textual motion
In the last decades of the 20th century many writers have been interested in the expressional possibilities offered by the democratization of the moving image, especially by the video media. One result from this is the video poetry developed, among others, by E.M. Melo e Castro, Richard Kostelanetz and Arnaldo Antunes from the 60’s onwards. If one were to trace a thorough history of the virtual textual motion, the tradition of video and multimedia poetry should be taken into consideration. On the other hand, it could also be fruitful to examine how video artists have experimented with the so-called natural language and linguistic articulation. Here I’m thinking especially of Gary Hill

Sometimes you find nothing, and then you find some-thing you love to do. Sometimes you make mistakes, but some-times it's true. In two minutes, you understand what you must do for the next two years. Sometimes it's in the studio, but other times it's walking in the street or reading a magazine. It's a good life, being an artist, because you do what you want.

Screening Room was a 1970s Boston television series that for almost ten years offered independent filmmakers a chance to show and discuss their work on a commercial (ABC-TV) affiliate station. The series was developed and hosted by filmmaker Robert Gardner (Dead Birds, Forest of Bliss), who was Chairman of the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies and Director of the Carpenter Center for Visual Arts at Harvard for many years. This unique program dealt even-handedly with animation, documentary, and experimental film, welcoming such artists as Jan Lenica, John and Faith Hubley, Emile DeAntonio, Jean Rouch, Ricky Leacock, Jonas Mekas, Bruce Baillie, Yvonne Rainer and Michael Snow. Frequently, guests such as Octavio Paz, Stanley Cavell, and Rudolph Arnheim appeared as well. The filmmakers presented on the show are now considered the most influential contributors to modern experimental film, documentary, and animation.

Our situation is this: most of the people in this world believe that the Creator of the universe has written a book. We have the misfortune of having many such books on hand, each making an exclusive claim as to its infallibility. People tend to organize themselves into factions according to which of these incompatible claims they accept rather than on the basis of language, skin color, location of birth, or any other criterion of tribalism. Each of these texts urges its readers to adopt a variety of beliefs and practices, some of which are benign, many of which are not. All are in perverse agreement on one point of fundamental importance, however: respect for other faiths, or for the views of unbelievers, is not an attitude that God endorses.

The term was coined by Sullivan in late 2000, when he submitted deliberately bad poems to Poetry.com's poetry  contest  (actually a marketing scheme) as a way of testing Poetry.com's supposed standards for excellence. (It should be noted that the practice of Poetry.com-baiting predates flarf itself; many other individuals, including North Carolina poet Patrick Herron and syndicated humorist Dave Barry, have engaged in similar pranks.)

This sustained pattern of neural activity was characterized by a specific increase of coherence between distant areas, suggesting conscious perception is broadcasted widely across the cortex.

levelHead is a spatial memory game by Julian Oliver.

levelHead uses a hand-held solid-plastic cube as its only interface. On-screen it appears each face of the cube contains a little room, each of which are logically connected by doors.

In one of these rooms is a character. By tilting the cube the player directs this character from room to room in an effort to find the exit.

 Transform the traditional dissertation. In the arts and humanities, where looming cutbacks will be most devastating, there is no longer a market for books modeled on the medieval dissertation, with more footnotes than text. As financial pressures on university presses continue to mount, publication of dissertations, and with it scholarly certification, is almost impossible. (The average university press print run of a dissertation that has been converted into a book is less than 500, and sales are usually considerably lower.) For many years, I have taught undergraduate courses in which students do not write traditional papers but develop analytic treatments in formats from hypertext and Web sites to films and video games. Graduate students should likewise be encouraged to produce “theses” in alternative formats.  (Mark C. Taylor. April 26, 2009)

 ...our aim lies in developing simple, deterministic and traceable generative processes. These simple processes have the advantage of more control: as they are highly determinable, their output is predictable and can therefore be easily refined through subsequent adjustments. We aim to show that a single deterministic process can generate a heterogeneous set of forms with an astounding degree of complexity.

Artisans des médias de partout dans le monde, un moment historique est advenu: du temps reculé des scribes jusqu’aux blogueurs, du cinématographe des Lumière jusqu’au dernier cri des cellulaires-caméra, les moyens de production et de distribution sont de nouveau à portée de tous!

 I don't have any ideas myself; I have a vacant mind, in order to do exactly what the inspiration calls for... Art is responded to with emotion... art is not intellectual at all. ... I guess I am rather extreme. I think we don't deserve any credit. The inspiration comes to me and tells me exactly what to do... I gave up all of theory... so that leaves me with a clear mind. ... An empty mind, so when something comes into it, you can see it...

 In this study, scientists took cells from a chicken heart and used them to form bio-ink particles, which were then printed on to thick sheets. Heart cells must be synchronized for the heart to beat properly. When the bio-ink particles were first printed, the cells did not beat in unison, but as the cellular spheroids fused, the structure eventually started beating just as a heart does.

 Gnoetry is an on-going experiment in human/computer collaborative poetry composition.

Gnoetry synthesizes language randomly based on its analysis of existing texts. Any machine-readable text or texts, in any language, can serve as the basis of the Gnoetic process. Gnoetry generates sentences that mimic the local statistical properties of the source texts. This language is filtered subject to additional constraints (syllable counts, rhyming, etc.) to produce a poem.

[...]

A key aspect of the Gnoetry software is the ability of a human operator to intervene in the language generation cycle, helping to “guide” the artistic process and to produce a result that is a true collaboration of equals.

 There has been a long controversy as to whether subjectively 'free' decisions are determined by brain activity ahead of time. We found that the outcome of a decision can be encoded in brain activity of prefrontal and parietal cortex up to 10 s before it enters awareness. This delay presumably reflects the operation of a network of high-level control areas that begin to prepare an upcoming decision long before it enters awareness.  Nature Neuroscience 11, 543

To make use of 3d cg space in a uniquely digital way, space is not cut by a projection of a plane onto a 2d screen anymore: instead, we ‘look’ through the cutting shape of a 3d object to realise the shape of another. It also employs a remix concept that could be called ‘database modeling’: no modeling has been done, all 3d objects have been downloaded from free resources on the web.

 At this point in the history of electronic literature, the question is not how we can monetize it, in the sense of getting people to pay money for things, but rather how we can communitize it.

 The evidence now seems unmistakable:  reading extensively on the web has strong neurological consequences. To sum up this research: web reading catalyzes greater pattern recognition, increased spatial facility, and greater flexibility in noticing and responding to different information flows. It also leads to a distracted kind of reading in which (compared to print)  information is not processed as fully, remembered as long, or integrated as much into one's existing mental schemas (held in long term memory). ...  evidence suggests that the low-level activities of Web reading (clicking links, navigating websites, etc.), small as they are, nevertheless increase the cognitive load and therefore decrease the effectiveness with which information can be processed.

   In the author’s view, the projection of words into space is “the ultimate stage of writing”, the affirmation of presence within language... images [...] form an integral part of a construction in the architectural sense of the word ... The exploration of the limits of meaning, the creation of semantic halos, the frequently jagged syntax attempt to render the slight fuzziness of perception as it captures reality ... likes to explore genre transgression.

 If the fine-structure constant really does vary through space, it may provide a way of studying the elusive “higher dimensions” that many theories of reality predict, but which are beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth. In these theories, the constants observed in the three-dimensional world are reflections of what happens in higher dimensions. It is natural in these theories for such constants to change their values as the universe expands and evolves  The Economist. Aug. 2010 reporting on research by Julian A. King et al.

In their most stringent formulations, the Language poets of the 1970s and 80s set forth a politically charged theory that saw ordinary language as an ally of capitalist oppression.

The concept of poem as an open diagram, when it incorporates the notions of plurality, interrelationship and reciprocity of codes, not only guarantees the viability of poetry in a society subject to constant technological revolutions, but places it in a privileged position -> that of an universal progressive poetry (as Schlegel foresaw) or simply: poiesis (from greek = creation, making).

«Heart Beats Dust» 1968

 In a black rectangular box, a window at eye level opens onto a 24' cube which houses the sculpture. The form is created by thrusting dust up into a cone of light. The dust is Lithol Rubine, a brilliant red pigment chosen for its ability to remain suspended in air for long periods. The thrust is achieved by amplified heart-beats from an attached stethoscope or a continuous loop tape recording of heartbeats played on a speaker mounted directly under a tightly stretched rubber membrane upon which the dust sits.

 Can computers learn to read? We think so. Read the Web is a research project that attempts to create a computer system that learns over time to read the web. Since January 2010, our computer system called NELL (Never-Ending Language Learner) has been running continuously, attempting to perform two tasks each day: First, it attempts to 'read,' or extract facts from text found in hundreds of millions of web pages (e.g., playsInstrument(George_Harrison, guitar)). Second, it attempts to improve its reading competence, so that tomorrow it can extract more facts from the web, more accurately.

 In this paper we identify the homeland of the Indo-European language family by adapting ‘phylogeographic’ methods initially developed by epidemiologists to trace the origins of virus outbreaks. Instead of comparing viruses, we compare languages and instead of DNA, we look for shared cognates – words that have a common origin, such as “mother,” “mutter” and “madre” – across various Indo-European languages. We use the cognates to infer a family tree of the languages and, together with information about the location of each language, we trace back through time to infer the location at the root of the tree – the origin of Indo-European. 

Origin: Anatolia Plateau
Anatolia (from Greek Ἀνατολή Anatolē —  east  or  (sun)rise ; also Asia Minor, from Greek: Μικρὰ Ἀσία Mikrá Asía  small Asia ; in modern Turkish: Anadolu) is a geographic and historical term denoting the westernmost protrusion of Asia, comprising the majority of the Republic of Turkey.

This piece was created by scanning electron microscopy. The lines of the gradually self-reducing anagram poem were printed on a semiconductor device sample of Germanium and Silicon dioxide. The lines of the poem were written by a focus Ga ion beam into the sample. Placed into the microscope, the sequences of images were scanned by electrons at ranges from 400x all the way to 10000x. The first line was taken from the manual of the focused ion beam imaging system.





 
Teaching in the Margins: Michael Joyce 
Full Stop

 In conferences and class salons (the term I’ve taken to using, rather than workshops, for writing classes) I often perplex students by asking of a poem or a piece of fiction of theirs, “What do you want it to do?” At first this is confusing (voila succès!) and they tend to respond in terms of meanings, motifs, internal rhythms and the like, against which I push back, insisting that, if writing is to be anything, it must first be an action in this world. This is a standard I hold myself to as well, and which in my writing I most often fail to meet, finding dark consolation in Beckett’s “Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.”

There simply is no compelling reason why I, or anyone, should suppose that all and only human beings are the worthy targets of moral concern.

Convergent evidence indicates that non-human animals have the neuroanatomical, neurochemical, and neurophysiological substrates of conscious states along with the capacity to exhibit intentional behaviors. Consequently, the weight of evidence indicates that humans are not unique in possessing the neurological substrates that generate consciousness. Nonhuman animals, including all mammals and birds, and many other creatures, including octopuses, also possess these neurological substrates  (July 7, 2012) Written by Philip Low and edited by Jaak Panksepp, Diana Reiss, David Edelman, Bruno Van Swinderen, Philip Low, and Christof Koch.

AKASHA ( [aːkaːʃə], आकाश) has roots in Sanskrit and means “ether” in both its elemental and metaphysical senses.

The ancient Sanskrit-speaking civilization envisioned akasha as a metaphysical information network connecting humanity with itself and infinite knowledge. In this paradigm, thoughts, ideas, feelings, and experiences are stored forever and shared through the ether, which acts as an universal field connecting multiple planes of existence.

Thousands of years later we have created a modern information network openly connecting humans with each other and perpetual knowledge.

Tangle removes the tension and cost of miners that plague Bitcoin and, as it looks to scale, Ethereum.

Proof-of-Stake … doesn’t require miners to do useless math in a race to solve a block.

I was reading the code of the June 23rd announcement of MultiModel Learning Across Domains (code) (blog) when (in that classic post-attention hyper-shifting net-mode) an article on Bancor Unchained: All Your Token Are Belong To Us somehow appeared to warn me:

“The only thing that matters is what’s in the code.”
Bancor Unchained highlights the fact that the smart contract is executed by compiled code, not ideas or promises. The features announced by an ICO, and the nuanced philosophical or theoretical whitepapers (pdf) that precede or accompany an ICO ( these mysterious mania-driven events) might not be fully reflected in the pragmatic reality of what the code (which is at its core the smart contract; the smarts of it being nothing more than the tedious encrypted tension of encapsulated processes reiterating) can do.

Reading the the Bancor code does not offer a glimpse of a theoretical paradigm leap in programming structure: the code begins with ‘pragma’ and ‘import’ statements (also found in Swift, Java, Python, Haskell, Go, Scala, Objective C etc…). It uses syntax historically indiscernible from other code.

In other words, as the lawyers are swept out and dissolve in a swarm of irrelevancies, a new tide carries in programmers, who distill and implement the ideals of politicals, who have imbibed on philosophies of deterritorialized egalitarianism, who have perhaps had a poetic epiphany or vision of another world. At each juncture of that flow, the idealistic impulse mutates, descending, concretized susceptible to selfishness.

Prepare for a new breed of power: the code-lawyer, a synthesis of programmer, lawyer and contractual negotiator. Prepare for gender bias in the tech and law world to continue. The law-ICO-programmer becomes the final interpreter who implements the subtle fine print, backdoors, and grift. Code is the new fine print:

“the large print giveth and the small print taketh away”
As David Graeber outlines in Debt, the Axial Age (from 8th-3rd BCE, which the existential philosopher Karl Jaspers identified as the birth zone of philosophy in India, China, Greece and Mesopotamia) was also the period when money and organized armies of mercenaries were born. These shifts consolidated numerous extraordinary transitions in culture and thought. Yet they did not change core hierarchical tribal territorial patterns of acquisitiveness.

For the classroom, the watchwords are agility, openness, and consensus: identify what needs to be learned, distribute the load among the students eager and able to do it, agree on their roles, responsibilities, and rewards, and then codify these rights in smart contracts.”






I was reading the code of the June 23rd announcement of MultiModel Learning Across Domains (code) (blog) when (in that classic post-attention hyper-shifting net-mode) an article on Bancor Unchained: All Your Token Are Belong To Us somehow appeared to warn me:

“The only thing that matters is what’s in the code.”
Bancor Unchained highlights the fact that the smart contract is executed by compiled code, not ideas or promises. The features announced by an ICO, and the nuanced philosophical or theoretical whitepapers (pdf) that precede or accompany an ICO ( these mysterious mania-driven events) might not be fully reflected in the pragmatic reality of what the code (which is at its core the smart contract; the smarts of it being nothing more than the tedious encrypted tension of encapsulated processes reiterating) can do.

Reading the the Bancor code does not offer a glimpse of a theoretical paradigm leap in programming structure: the code begins with ‘pragma’ and ‘import’ statements (also found in Swift, Java, Python, Haskell, Go, Scala, Objective C etc…). It uses syntax historically indiscernible from other code.

In other words, as the lawyers are swept out and dissolve in a swarm of irrelevancies, a new tide carries in programmers, who distill and implement the ideals of politicals, who have imbibed on philosophies of deterritorialized egalitarianism, who have perhaps had a poetic epiphany or vision of another world. At each juncture of that flow, the idealistic impulse mutates, descending, concretized susceptible to selfishness.

Prepare for a new breed of power: the code-lawyer, a synthesis of programmer, lawyer and contractual negotiator. Prepare for gender bias in the tech and law world to continue. The law-ICO-programmer becomes the final interpreter who implements the subtle fine print, backdoors, and grift. Code is the new fine print:

“the large print giveth and the small print taketh away”
As David Graeber outlines in Debt, the Axial Age (from 8th-3rd BCE, which the existential philosopher Karl Jaspers identified as the birth zone of philosophy in India, China, Greece and Mesopotamia) was also the period when money and organized armies of mercenaries were born. These shifts consolidated numerous extraordinary transitions in culture and thought. Yet they did not change core hierarchical tribal territorial patterns of acquisitiveness.

We are in the midst of another Axial Age. Cryptocurrencies will eradicate paper currency. Smart contracts and blockchains are the foundations of new forms of business and community. Yet until the instincts of humanity mutate, basic inequity will persist.

Ok it may be an over-statement, but i am pretty annoyed.

On Tuesday July 4th I purchased a Google Daydream headset. The cashier informed me at checkout it was unreturnable if the box was opened. No worries: it only cost 100$ and I intended to keep it, to bring it to University of Bergen in Norway for a VR seminar and use it as a cheap comfortable untethered VR viewing device for some demos I had made.

Daydream is designed specifically for the Google Pixel phone. I had bought the Pixel because I like vanilla stock Android (I like it so much I previously owned a Nexus and a Nexus 6P). An OS apparently without any corporate cruft. Yet I was about to learn how the internet of things circumvents apparent transparency. Daydream would become a nightmare.

That afternoon I slotted my phone into the Daydream device with a demo I’d made using Mozilla’s A-Frame, a lightweight webvr toolkit (based on the JavaScript library for 3D manipulation called Three.js). A-Frame allows for quick deployment of VR in a browser.

Sweet. Wonderful. It worked. I spent the afternoon developing and that evening cycled over to a friend who works as a knowledge broker at Concordia University. Sitting in his backyard under the trees, he experienced 3 of my webvr demos using the Daydream headset. I was pleased. Situation normal. The headset was easy to open and close, the head strap comfortable, the viewing quality reasonable. I was happy with my purchase.

On Tuesday July 5th, I decided to test out a VR work made specifically for the Daydream headset (made by folks I know, Samantha Gorman and Danny Cannizzaro from Tender Claws) called Virtual Virtual Reality.

Virtual Virtual Reality proved to be exquisitely interesting, clever, professional, well-written and engaging. A joy to experience. Intimidatingly proficient. Ironically subversive.

I was enthralled. On June 29th, A-Frame announced link traversals that included support for the Daydream controller. I was looking forward to playing around, creating some quick demos.

But that’s when the trouble began. Pairing the controller and installing the dedicated Daydream app eradicated the capacity to use webvr demos I had hosted on my site, even the ones I had previously viewed in the headset. When I loaded my browser demos and put my Pixel into the headset, it now auto launched a pairing process, then switched to the Daydream app.

No biggie. I figured I just had to reset it somehow. Check app settings. Nothing. Enable flags for webvr and gamepad api in Chrome. Restart. Unsolved. Hmm. Uninstall Daydream. Restart. Put phone in headset, Android now prompted me to install Daydream. Uh-to.

The Origins Trail

Now I began to sweat. Search for a solution led to the PlayCanvas website, a platform tool for creating VR (initiated by Google, it costs $15 per month to have any export capacity). And the Origins Trails process where Google sanctioned select key developers to use this experimental webvr functionality inside their headset (“Implement a framework for exposing experimental features in the browser, but only to specific/registered origins, for limited duration and subject to global usage caps”). The rationale for this from a dev perspective is presented here.

Bottom line (as i understand it): only webvr projects sanctioned by Google work within the Daydream headset. It’s as if you bought a radio or a TV set that would only play channels approved by the manufacturer. What’s happened to the freedom of the web? Is content equivalent to an app? The headset is just a set of lens.

The Internet of Silos.

So I made a painful decision, I reset my Pixel phone to factory defaults. I was hoping to return to that evening in my friend’s backyard under the trees, using Daydream as a comfortable untethered lightweight webvr viewing utility, forget about the controller. The purity of Android could not fail me. Yet it did. Placing the reset-to-factory-default phone in the headset, immediately triggered the same irreversible context switch: “Daydream install required. In order to play… Please update.”

There are two levels of resetting Android. I had done the soft reset. So I tried to do the hard reset. It failed. Brainless brick.

Corporate Curated Consciousness

Result: I slowly realized that if I enable the webvr flags in chrome, it cannot view webvr stereoscopically hosted on my site: thus even Cardboard is worthless for demos. With webvr flags enabled, the stereoscopic launch button no longer works unless I visit google-approved webvr. Nightly Firefox does not function in stereoscopic any more: why? Who knows.

I am stranded with a corporate headset that curates content, jealously guarding its portal. Radical infantilism. Reality reloaded with a subset of Reality controlled by geeks and brand marketers. Ironically it echoes the storyline of the Virtual Virtual Reality project where VR headsets defined by corporate ideology define reality.

How? My suspicion is the headset after the first launch of the Daydream app passively inserted the Bluetooth ID of my phone into an on-device storage array. The headset now knows my phone. It does not care about its OS or factory reset.

Android bypassed. Lock initialized. Object to object. Thing to thing silo.

Unremovable solitude. Implacable logos.

Google famous motto is “Don’t be Evil”. Hannah Arendt famously noted the banality of evil. In a future where information/ideologies/culture become branded battlefields, constraints on consciousness will arise. A decision made to increase brand loyalty today can sprout future tyranny. The world is not without auspicious examples: from the Great Firewall of China to the bunkered intelligence services of all great nations, control proliferates to apparently protect. Insidious bureaucracies slide into authoritarianism.

Jealousy is one of the deepest instincts of the psyche. The song of Solomon speaks of the bitter fire that burns thereof as worse than the taste of death. Ownership‘s primordial glandular fury flexes it’s muscles. Sculpting opportunities within commodities into contemporary shackles.

Banal evil arises when interface design succumbs to corporate imperatives.

Brand chastity.

Interoperability issues, incompatible formats, silos. It’s not new.

Instagram, Snapchat, Uber, Maps: gated. Share something from Evernote on a phone, and it’s impossible to leave the silo. Load a webpage or video through Facebook and it’s lovingly wrapped in their very own branding, links and data mining sauce. All brands do it. The larger the corporation, the more likely you can never leave it’s boundaries and that the border will be guarded and exact a fee of time. The banality of evil.

It has become a truism to recognize that corporations grasp at usage data. It’s normative tedium, cages masquerading as loyalty bonus.

My favorite company to critique in this regard is Apple. I have a MacBook Air,. I love it. It is a wonderful rugged piece of technology, an agile jeep sliding over code surfaces. But the Apple urge to encapsulate consumer self often feels manipulative, click bait designed to prevent miscegenation with other devices. iTunes is border control. Back at headquarters they want you to live and die within the Apple ecosystem.

Unfortunately I use 5 computers with 4 operating systems: OSX, Windows, Linux, and Android. My life is a field of numb juggling. Squabbling kids. My suspicion is that when a corporation combines software and hardware, the silo grows a wormhole into brand gravity.

VR as PR

This is a story of how I prepared for a VR seminar and how a single hardware purchase resulted in a mild yet annoying software blockade. And how this blockade implies something latent deeper and more pernicious: the potential for corporate decisions to influence self through VR MR AR.

In an ecosystem of informational overlays, when interfaces reflect decisions made for profit, and brand loyalty triumphs over transparency, then culture-silos imply ownership of people. Mind-control is imminent. Google Daydream represents a dangerous precedent for propaganda

Facebook has no financial interest in telling the truth. No company better exemplifies the internet-age dictum that if the product is free, you are the product.

Why would Facebook care if the news streaming over the site is fake? Its interest is in the targeting, not in the content.”

The clinical assessment of suicidal risk would be substantially complemented by a biologically based measure that assesses alterations in the neural representations of concepts related to death and life in people who engage in suicidal ideation. This study used machine-learning algorithms (Gaussian Naive Bayes) to identify such individuals (17 suicidal ideators versus 17 controls) with high (91%) accuracy, based on their altered functional magnetic resonance imaging neural signatures of death-related and life-related concepts. The most discriminating concepts were ‘death’, ‘cruelty’, ‘trouble’, ‘carefree’, ‘good’ and ‘praise’.”

Conclusions: Injury to a small region in the pontine tegmentum is significantly associated with coma.

Plus, the water harvesting technology employing MOF isn’t limited to drinking water.”

LIKE A BURNING HOUSE

1.
I no longer care if I die, said Korin, then, after a long silence, pointed to the nearby flooded quarry: Are those swans?

2.
Seven children squatted in a semi-circle surrounding him in the middle of the railway footbridge, almost pressing him against the barrier, just as they had done some half an hour earlier when they first attacked him in order to rob him, exactly so in fact, except that by now none of them thought it worthwhile either to attack or to rob him, since it was obvious that, on account of certain unpredictable factors, robbing or attacking him was possible but pointless because he really didn't seem to have anything worth taking, the only thing he did have appearing to be some mysterious burden, the existence of which, gradually, at a certain point in Korin's madly rambling monologue - which "to tell you the truth," as they said, "was boring as shit"- became apparent, most acutely apparent in fact, when he started talking about the loss of his head, at which point they did not stand up and leave him babbling like some halfwit, but remained where they were, in the positions they had originally intended to adopt, squatting immobile in a semi-circle, because the evening had darkened around them, because the gloom descending silently on them in the industrial twilight numbed them, and because this frozen dumb condition had drawn their most intense attention, not to the figure of Korin which had swum beyond them, but to the one object remaining: the rails below.

3.
Nobody asked him to speak, only that he should hand over his money, but he didn't, saying he had none, and carried on speaking, hesitantly at first, then more fluently, and finally continuously and unstoppably, because the eyes of the seven children had plainly scared him, or, as he himself put it, his stomach had turned in fear, and, as he said, once his stomach was gripped by fear he absolutely had to speak, and furthermore, since the fear had not passed - after all, how could he know whether they were carrying weapons or not - he grew ever more absorbed in his speech, or rather he became ever more absorbed by the idea of telling them everything from beginning to end, of telling someone in any case, because, from the time that he had set out in secret, at the last possible moment, to embark on his "great journey" as he called it, he had not exchanged a word, not a single word, with anyone, considering it too dangerous, though there were few enough people he could engage in conversation in any case, since he hadn't so far met anybody sufficiently harmless, nobody, at least, of whom he was not wary, because in fact there really was nobody harmless enough, which meant he had to be wary of everyone, because, as he had said at the beginning, whoever it was he set eyes on it was the same thing he saw, a figure, that is, who, directly or indirectly, was in contact with those who pursued him, someone related intimately or distantly, but most certainly related, to those who, according to him, kept tabs on his every move, and it was only the speed of his movements, as he later explained, that kept him "at least half a day" ahead of them, though these gains were specific to places and occasions: so he had not said a word to anyone, and only did so now because fear drove him, because it was only under the natural pressure of fear that he ventured into these most important areas of his life, venturing deeper and deeper still, offering them ever more profound glimpses of it in order to defeat them, to make them face him so that he might purge his assailants of the tendency to assail, so he should convince all seven of them that someone had not only given himself up to them, but, with his giving, had somehow outflanked them.

The air was full of the sharp, nauseous smell of tar that cut through everything, nor did the strong wind help because the wind, that had chilled them through to the bone, merely intensified and whipped the smell up without being able to substitute anything else for it in return, the whole neighborhood for several kilometers being thick with it, but here more than anywhere else, for it emanated directly from the Rákos railway yard, from that still visible point where the rails concentrated and began to fan out, ensuring that air and tar would be indistinguishable,  making it very hard to tell what else, apart from soot and smoke, that smell - composed of the hundreds and thousands of trains that rumbled through, the filthy sleepers, the rubble and the metallic stench of the rails - comprised, and it wouldn't be just these but other, more obscure, almost indiscernible ingredients, ingredients without name,  that would certainly have included the weight of human futility ferried here by hundreds and thousands of carriages, the scary and sickening view from the bridge of the power of a million wills bent to a single purpose and, just as certainly, the dreary spirit of desolation and industrial stagnation that had hovered about the place and settled on it decades ago, in all of which Korin was now endeavoring to locate himself, having originally determined simply to cross over to the far side as quickly, silently and inconspicuously as possible in order to escape into what he supposed to be the city center, instead of which he was having, under present circumstances,  to pull himself together at a cold and draughty point of the world, and to hang on to whatever incidental detail he could make out, from his eye-level at any rate, whether this was barrier, curb, asphalt or metal, or appeared the most significant, if only so that this footbridge, some hundred meters from the railway yard, might become a passage between the non-existing to the existing section of the world,  forming therefore an important early adjunct, as his later put it, to his mad life as a fugitive, an bridge that, had he not been detained, he would have rushed obliviously across.

5.
It had begun suddenly, without preamble, without presentiment, preparation or rehearsal, at one specific moment on his forty-fourth birthday, that he was struck, agonizingly and immediately, by the consciousness of it, as suddenly and unexpectedly, he told them, as he was by the appearance of the seven of them here, in the middle of the footbridge, on that day when he was sitting by a river at a spot where he would occasionally sit in any case, this time because he didn't feel like going home to an empty apartment on his birthday, and it really was extremely sudden, the way it struck him that, good heavens, he understood nothing, nothing at all about anything, for Christ's sake, nothing at all about the world, which was a most terrifying realization, he said, especially in the way it came to him in all its banality, vulgarity, at a sickeningly ridiculous level, but this was the point, he said, the way that he, at the age of forty-four, had become aware of how utterly stupid he seemed to himself, how empty, how utterly block-headed he had been in his understanding of the world these last forty-four years, for, as he realized by the river, he had not only misunderstood it, but had not understood anything about anything, the worst part being that for forty-four years he thought he had understood it, while in reality he had failed to do so; and this in fact was the worst thing of all that night of his birthday when he sat alone by the river, the worst because the fact that he now realized that he had not understood it  did not mean that he understand it now, because being aware of his lack of knowledge was not in itself some new form of knowledge for which an older one could be traded in, but one that presented itself as a terrifying puzzle the moment he thought about the world, as he most furiously did that evening, all but torturing himself in the effort to understand it and failing, because the puzzle seemed ever more complex and he had begun to feel that this world-puzzle that he was so desperate to understand, that he was torturing himself trying to understand was really the puzzle of himself and the world at once, that they were in effect one and the same thing, which was the conclusion he had so far reached, and he had not yet given up on it, when, after a couple of days, he noticed that there was something the matter with his head.

By this time he had lived alone for years, he explained to the seven children, he too squatting and leaning against the barrier in the sharp November wind on the footbridge, alone because his marriage had been wrecked by the Hermes business (he gestured with his hand as if to say he would explain about it later), after which he had "badly burned his fingers with a deeply passionate love affair" and decided: never, never again, would he even so much as get close to a woman, which did not mean, of course, that he led an entirely solitary life, because, as Korin elaborated, gazing at the children, there was the occasional woman on the occasional difficult night, but essentially he was alone, though there remained the various people he came into contact with in the course of his work at the records office, as well as the neighbors with whom he had to maintain neighborly relations, the commuters he bumped into while commuting, the shoppers he met while shopping, the barflies he'd see in the bar and so forth, so that, after all, now he looked back at it, he was in regular contact with quite a lot of people, even if only on the most tenuous of terms, occupying the furthermost corner of the community, at least until they too started to melt away which probably dated from the time that he was feeling increasingly compelled to regale those he met at the records office, on the staircase at home, in the street, at the store and in the bar, with the regrettable news that he believed he was about to lose his head, because, once they understood that the loss was neither figurative nor symbolic but a genuine deprivation in the full physical sense of the word, that, to put it plainly, his head, alas, would actually be severed from his neck, they eventually fled from him as they might flee from a burning house, fleeing in their droves, and very soon every one of them had gone and he stood alone, very much like a burning house in fact: at first it being just the matter of a few people behaving in a more distant fashion, then his colleagues at the records offices ignoring him, not even returning his greeting, refusing to sit at the same table and finally crossing the street when they saw him, then people actually avoiding him in the street, and can you imagine, Korin asked the seven children, how painful this was? how it hurt me most, more than anything, he added, especially with what was happening to the vertebrae in his neck, and this was just when he most needed their support, he said, and while it was plain to see that he would have been pleased to explore this matter in the most intricate detail, it was equally obvious that it would have been wasted on the seven children because they would not have been able to respond in any way, being bored of the subject, particularly at the point when "the geezer started going on about losing his head" which meant "sod all" to them, as later they would tell their friends, and looked at one another while the oldest nodded in agreement with his younger companions as if to say, "forget it, it's not worth it", after which they simply continued squatting, watching the confluence of rails as the occasional goods wagon rattled by below them, though one did ask how much longer they were going to stay there as it was all the same to him, and the blond kid next to the senior one consulted his watch and replied merely that he'd tell them when it was time, and until then he should shut the fuck up.

7.
Had Korin known that they had already arrived at a decision, and specifically at this particular decision; had he in fact noted the meaningful gesture, nothing would have turned out as it did, but, since he hadn't noted it, he wasn't to know and, as a result, his perception of reality was incorrect; for to him it seemed that his current predicament - squatting on the ground with these children in the cold wind - was increasingly fraught with anxiety precisely because nothing was happening, and because it wasn't made clear to him what they wanted, if indeed they wanted anything at all, and since there was no explanation forthcoming as to why they were refusing to let him go or just leave him there, having succeeded in convincing them that the whole thing was pointless because he really had no money, he still felt that there should have been an explanation, and indeed had found one, albeit the wrong one as far as the seven children were concerned, he being aware of exactly how much money was sewn into the lining on the right side of his coat, so their immobility, their numbness, their failure to do anything, in fact the utter lack of any animation whatsoever on their part, took on an ever greater, ever more terrifying significance, though if he had looked at it another way he might have found it progressively more reassuring and less significant; which meant that he spent the first half of each moment preparing to spring to his feet and make a dash for it and the second half remaining precisely where he was, apparently content to stay there and to keep talking, as if he had only just begun his story; in other words, he was equally disposed to escape or remain, though every time he had to make a decision he chose, in fact, to remain, chiefly because he was scared of course, having constantly to assure them how happy he was to have found such sympathetic listeners and how good it all felt, because he had so much, it was extraordinary quite how much, to tell them, really and truly, because when you took time to think about it, 'extraordinary' was absolutely the right word to describe the complex details of his story which, he said, he should tell so it would be clear to them, so they should know how it was that Wednesday, at what precise time he could not remember but it was probably some thirty or forty hours ago, when the fateful day arrived and he realized that he really did have to embark on his "great journey", at which point he understood that everything, from Hermes down to his solitary condition, was driving him in one direction, that he must already have started on the journey because it was all prepared and everything else had collapsed, which is to say that everything ahead of him had been prepared and everything behind him had collapsed, as tended to be the way with all such "great journeys", said Korin.

8.
The only lamps burning were those at the top of the stairs and the light they gave out fell in dingy cones that shuddered in the intermittent gusts of wind that assailed them because the other neon lights positioned in the thirty or so meters between them had all been broken, leaving them squatting in darkness, yet as aware of each other, of their precise positions, as of the enormous mass of dark sky above the smashed neon, the sky which might have glimpsed the reflection of its own enormous dark mass as it trembled with stars in the vista of railway yards spreading below it, had there been some relationship between the trembling stars and the twinkling dull red semaphore of lights sprinkled among the rails, but there wasn't, there was no common denominator, no interdependence between them, the only order and relationship existing within the discrete worlds of above and below, and indeed of anywhere, for the field of stars and the forest of signals stared as blankly at each other as does each and every form of being, blind in darkness and blind in radiance, as blind on earth as it is in heaven, if only so that a long moribund symmetry among this vastness might appear in the lost glance of some higher being, at the center of which, naturally, there would be a miniscule blind-spot: as with Korin. the footbridge. the seven kids.

9. 
A total dickhead, they told a local acquaintance the next day, a total dickhead in a league of his own, a twat they really should have got rid of because you never knew when he'd grass on you, cause he'd had a good look at everybody's face, they added to each other, and could have made a mental note of their clothes, their shoes and everything else they were wearing that late afternoon, so, yeh, that's right, they admitted the next day, they should have got rid of him, only it didn't occur to any of them at the time to do so, everyone being so relaxed and all, so laid back, like a bunch of dopes on the footbridge while ordinary people carried on leading ordinary lives beneath them as they gazed at the darkening neighborhood above the converging rails and waited for the signals for the six-forty-eight in the distance so that they might rush down to the cuttings, taking up their positions behind the bushes in preparation for the usual ritual,  but, as they remarked, none of them had imagined that the ritual might have ended in some other fashion, with a different outcome, that it might be completed entirely successfully, triumphantly, smack on target, in other words with a death, in which case of course even a pathetic git like him would be an obvious danger because he might grass, they said, might get into a funk and, quite unexpectedly,  grass on them to the cops, and the reason it worked out differently, as it did in fact, leaving them to think the thoughts they had just thought, was that they hadn't been concentrating, and can't have been, otherwise they'd have realized that this was precisely the kind of man who presented no danger because, later, he couldn't even remember what, if anything, had happened at about six forty-eight, as he had fallen ever deeper under the spell of his own fear, the fear that drove his narrative onwards, a narrative that, there was no denying, apart from a certain rhythm, lacked all sense of shape or indeed anything that might have drawn attention to his own person, except perhaps its copiousness, which was the result of him trying to tell them everything at once, in the way he himself experienced what had happened to him in a kind of  simultaneity that he first noticed added up to a coherent whole that certain Wednesday morning some thirty or forty hours before, two-hundred-and-twenty kilometers from here in a travel agent's, at the point when he arrived at the front of the queue and was about to ask the time of the next train for Budapest and the cost of the ticket, when, standing at the counter, he suddenly felt that he should not ask that question here, at the same moment recognizing in the reflection in the glass over one of the posters over the counter, two employees of the District Psychiatric Unit, disguised as a pair of ordinary numbskulls, really, two of them, and behind him, at the entrance, a so-called nurse whose aggressive presence made his skin prickle and break into a sweat.

10.
The men from the District Psychiatric Unit, said Korin, never explained to him what he had wanted to know, which was the reason he had attended the unit to start with, and that was the matter of how the whole system that held the skull in place, from the first cervical vertebra through to the ligaments (the rectus capitis), actually functioned, but they never explained it, because they couldn't, chiefly because they themselves had not an inkling, their minds being shrouded in a wholly impenetrable darkness that resulted in them first staring at him in astonishment, as if to indicate that the question itself, the mere asking of it, was so ludicrous that it provided direct and incontrovertible proof of his, Korin's, madness, then giving each other significant glances and little nods whose portent was (was it not?) perfectly clear, that they had dismissed the subject, as a consequence of which he made no further enquiries regarding the matter but, even while steadfastly bearing the enormous weight of the problem, literally, on his shoulders, tried to solve the problem himself by asking what that certain first cervical vertebra and the rectus capitis actually were, how (sighed Korin) they performed their crucial functions and how it was that his skull was simply propped on the topmost vertebra of his spinal column, though when he thought about it at the time, or so he told them now, the idea of his skull being fixed to his spine by cerebro-spinal ligaments, which were the only things holding the lot together, was enough to send shivers down him when he thought of it, and still did send shivers down him, since even a brief examination of his own skull demonstrated the patent truth that this arrangement was so sensitive, so brittle, so vulnerable, in fact one of the most frail and delicate physical structures imaginable, that he concluded it must have been here, at this particular juncture, that his problems had begun and would end, for if the doctors were incapable of coming to any worthwhile conclusion after looking at his x-rays, and things had turned out as they had done so far, then, having steeped himself to some degree at least in the study of  medicine, and having conducted an endless self-examination based on this study, he had no hesitation in declaring  that the pain he was in had its root cause here, in that arrangement of tissue and bone, where vertebra met ligament, and that all attention should be focused on this point, on the ligaments, on which precise point he was not yet certain though he was certain enough about the sensation that spread through his neck and back, week by week, month by month, constantly increasing in intensity, knowing that the process had started and was proceeding irresistibly, and that this whole affair, if one considered it objectively, he said, was bound to lead to the terminal decay of the union of skull and spine, culminating in a condition, not to beat about the bush, for why should one, said Korin pointing to his neck, whereby this frail piece of skin finally gave out when he would inevitably lose his head.

11.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine sets of rails could be distinguished from the vantage point of the footbridge, and the seven of them could do little but count them over and over again, concentrating their attention on the confluence of rails in the perceptibly deepening darkness that was accentuated by the red lights of the signals while waiting for the six forty-eight to appear at last in the distance, for the tension that had suddenly appeared on everyone's hitherto relaxed countenance was occasioned by nothing more at this stage than the impending arrival of the six forty-eight, the mark they had set out to mug having failed, after their first couple of attempts, to provide sufficient entertainment in the short period of their waiting, so that within fifteen minutes of having cornered him, even if they had wanted to, they would have remained incapable of listening to a single word more of the seamless and endless monologue that, even now, cornered as he was, flowed unstoppably from him, because he kept on and on regardless, as they explained the next day, and it would have been unbearable had they not ignored him, because, they added, if they had continued to pay attention to him they would have had to do him in if only to preserve their own sanity, and they had, unfortunately, ignored him for the sake of their sanity, even though this resulted in them missing the chance of  eliminating him, for they really should have eliminated him good and proper, or so they kept repeating to themselves, particularly since the seven of them would normally have been perfectly aware what failing to do eliminate a witness might cost them, a witness like him, who would never completely vanish in the crowd, not to mention the fact that they had begun to get a reputation in certain important places as 'cut-throats', a reputation they had to protect, and killing him would not have been difficult, nor indeed a new proposition to them, and this way they would have been taking no chances.

12.
What had happened to him - Korin shook his head as if he still could not believe it - was, at the beginning, almost inconceivable, nigh unbearable, because even at first glance, following an initial survey of the complex nature of what was involved, one straight look told him that from now on he'd have to abandon his "sick hierarchical view of the world", explode "the illusion of an orderly pyramid of facts" and liberate himself from the extraordinarily powerful and secure belief in what was now revealed as merely a kind of childish mirage, which is to say the indivisible unity and contiguity of phenomena, and beyond that, the unity's secure permanence and stability; and, within this permanence and stability, the overall coherence of its mechanism, that strictly-governed interdependence of  functioning parts which gave the whole system its sense of direction, development, pace and progress, in other words whatever suggested that the thing it embodied was attractive and self-sufficient, or, to put it another way, he now had to say No, an immediate and once-and-for-all No, to that entire mode of life; but some hundred yards on he was forced to reconsider certain aspects of what he had originally termed his rejection of the hierarchical mode of thinking because it seemed to him that he had lost nothing by rejecting a particular order of things that he had elevated into a pyramid structure, a structure that self-evidently needed correcting or rejecting in perpetuity as misleading or inappropriate, no, strange to say, he had lost nothing by the rejection, for what had actually happened that certain night of his birthday, could not be accounted loss as such but rather gain, or at least as a first point gained, an advance in the direction of some all-but-inconceivable, all-but-unbearable end -and in the gradual process of walking the hundred paces from the river to the point where the struggle had begun, and having been granted a glimpse of the terrible complexity ahead, he saw that while the world appeared not to exist, the totality of that-which-had-been-thought-about-it did in fact exist, and, furthermore, that it was only this, in its countless thousands of varieties, that did exist as such, that what existed was his identity as the sum of the countless thousand imaginings of the human spirit that was engaged in writing the world, in writing his identity, he said, in terms of pure word, the doing word, the Verb that brooded over the waters, or, to put it another way, he added,  what became clear was that most opinions were a waste of time, that it was a waste thinking that life was a matter of appropriate conditions and appropriate answers, because the task was not to choose but to accept, there being no obligation to choose between what was appropriate and what was inappropriate, only to accept that we are not obliged to do anything except to comprehend that the appropriateness of the one great universal process of thinking is not predicated on it being correct, for there was nothing to compare it with, nothing but its own beauty, and it was its beauty that gave us confidence in its truth - and this, said Korin, was what struck him as he walked those hundred furiously-thinking paces on the evening of his birthday: that is to say he understood the infinite significance of faith and was given a new insight into what the ancients had long known, that it was faith in its existence that had both created and maintained the world; the corollary of which was that it was the loss of his own faith that was now erasing it, the result of which realization being, he said, that he experienced a sudden, utterly numbing, quite awful feeling of abundance, because from that time on he knew that whatever had once existed, existed still and that, quite unexpectedly, he had stumbled on an ontological place of such gravity that he could see - oh but how, he sighed, how to begin - that Zeus, for instance, to take an arbitrary example, was still 'there', now, in the present, just as all the other old gods of Olympus were 'there', as was Yahweh and The Lord God of Hosts, and there alongside them, the ghosts of every nook and cranny, and that this meant they had nothing and yet everything to fear, for nothing ever disappeared without trace, for the absent had a structure as real as the structure of whatever existed, and so, in other words, you could bump into Allah, into the Prince of the Rebel Angels, and into all the dead stars of the universe, which would of course include the barren unpopulated earth with its godless laws of being as well as the terrifying reality of hell and pandemonium which was the domain of the demons, and that was reality, said Korin: thousands upon thousands of worlds, each one different, majestic or fearsome; thousands upon thousands in their ranks, he continued, his voice rising, in a single absent relationship, that was how it all appeared to him then, he explained, and it was then, when he had got so far, continually reliving the infinite capacity of the process of becoming, that the trouble with his head first started, the predictable course of which process he had already outlined, and possibly it was the sheer abundance, the peculiar inexhaustibility of history and the gods that he found hard to bear, for ultimately he didn't know, nor to this very day was it clear to him, precisely how the pain that started suddenly and simultaneously in his neck and his back, began: the forgetting, subject by subject, random, ungovernable and extraordinarily rapid, first of facts such as where he had put the key that he had only just now been holding in his hand, or what page he had got to in the book he had been reading the previous night, and, later, what had happened on Wednesday, three days ago, in the time between morning and evening, and after that, whatever was important, urgent, dull or insignificant, and finally, even his mother's name, he said, the scent of apricots, whatever made familiar faces familiar, whether he had in fact completed tasks he had set himself to complete - in a word, he said, there was literally nothing that stayed in his head, the whole world had vanished, step by step, the disappearance itself having neither rhyme nor reason in its progress, as if what there was left was somehow sufficient, or as if there were always something of greater importance that a higher, incomprehensible force had decided he should forget.

13.
I must somehow have drunk of the waters of Lethe, Korin explained, and while disconsolately wagging his head as if to convey to them that the understanding of the manner and consequence of events would probably always lie beyond him, he brought out a box of Marlboros: Anyone got a light?

14.
They were roughly the same age, the youngest being eleven, the oldest perhaps thirteen or fourteen, but every one of them had at least one slip-cased razor-blade nestling by his side, nor was it just a matter of nestling there, for each of them, from the youngest to the oldest, was capable of handling it expertly, whether it was of the simple 'singleton' kind or the triple sort they referred to as 'the set', and not one of them lacked the ability to yank the thing forth in the blinking of an eyelid and slip it between two fingers into the tense palm without the merest flickering of outward emotion while gazing steadily at the victim so that whichever of them happened to be in the right position could, quick as a flash, find the artery on the neck, this being the skill they had most perfectly mastered, a skill which rendered them, when all seven of them were together, so exceptionally dangerous that they had begun to earn a genuinely well-deserved reputation, only through constant practice, of course, the practice that enabled them to achieve their current level of performance and involved a carefully planned course of training that they carried through at constantly changing venues, repeating the same moves a hundred times, over and over again, until they could execute the moves with inimitable, blinding speed and such perfect co-ordination that in the course of an attack, they knew instinctively, without saying a word to each other,  not only who would advance and who would stand, but how those standing would form up, nor was there any room for boasting, you couldn't even think of it, so faultless was their teamwork, and in any case, the sight of gushing blood was enough to stop their mouths and render them dumb, disciplined and solemn, perhaps even too solemn, for the solemnity was something of a burden to them, leaving them with a desire for some course of action that would lead rather more playfully, more fortuitously, that is to say entailing a greater risk of failure, to the fact of death, since this was what they all sought, this was the way things had developed, this was what interested them, in fact it was the reason they had gathered here in the first place, the reason they had already spent a good many afternoons, so many weeks of afternoons and early evenings, passing the time right here.

15.
There was absolutely nothing ambiguous about the way he moved, said Korin next day in the MALEV tourist office, the whole thing being so completely normal, so ordinary, the reaching for his cigarettes so perfectly innocent and harmless that it was merely a kind of instinct, the result of an on-the-spur-of-the-moment notion that he might lessen the tension and thereby ease his own situation by a friendly gesture such as the offering of cigarettes, for really, no exaggeration, it was just that and nothing more, and while he expected almost anything to happen as a result, what he did not expect was to find another hand holding his wrist by the time his had reached the Marlboros in his pocket, a hand that did not grip the way a pair of handcuffs would, but one that rendered him immobile and sent a flood of warmth lapping across his wrist, or so he explained the next day, still in a state of shock, while at the same time, he continued, he felt his muscles weaken, only those muscles that were grasping the pack of Marlboros, and all this happened without a word being exchanged and, what was more - apart from the child nearest to him, who had responded so nimbly and with such breath-taking skill to the gesture he had misinterpreted - the group did not move an inch, but merely glanced at the falling Marlboro packet, until one of them eventually lifted it up, opened it and drew out a cigarette, passed it on to the next, and so forth to the end while he, Korin, in his terror, behaved as though nothing had happened, nothing significant at least, or, if anything had happened it was only by accident so minor and so unworthy of mention as to be laughable, an accident that left him gripping his wounded wrist with his blameless hand, not quite understanding what had happened, and even when he did eventually realize, he merely pressed his thumb against the tiny nick, for that was all it was, he told them, a miniscule cut, and when the expected rush of panic, with its attendant throbbing, trembling, and loud noises in the head began to die away, an icy calm had lapped about him in much the same way as the blood had lapped about his wrist, in other words, as he declared the next day, he was utterly convinced that they were going to kill him.

16
The work in the records office, he continued in a quavering voice, having waited for the last of the children to light his cigarette, did not involve, as did that of so many others, at least as far as he personally was concerned, a process of humiliation, blackmail, of wearing people down; no, not in his case, he stressed: on the contrary, he was bound to say, that after 'the sad turn of events in his social life', it was precisely his work that remained most important to him, that was his sole consolation both in the obligatory and voluntary after-hours areas of his specialization; it was the one thing, in the fundamental and, as far as he was concerned, fateful, process of the last few months of coming to terms with a reality which involved acknowledging the not-so-much bitter as amusing evidence that showed history and truth had nothing to do with each other, that demonstrated to him that everything he, in his capacity as a local historian, had done to explore, establish, maintain and nurture as history, had in fact given him an extraordinary freedom and raised him to a state of grace; because once he was capable of considering how any particular history served as a peculiar - if one regarded its origins, accidental, and if one considered its outcomes, cynically concocted and artificially articulated - blend of some remaining elements of the truth, of human understanding and the  imaginative re-creation of the past, of what could and could not be known, of confusion, of lies, of exaggerations, of both fidelity to- and  misuse of- given data, of both proper and improper interpretations of evidence, of inklings, suggestions and of the marshalling of a sufficiently imposing body of opinion, then the work in the records office, the labor of, what was referred to as, the classifying and ordering of archive material and indeed all such enterprises, represented nothing less than  freedom itself, for it did not matter in the least what task he was currently engaged on, whether the classification was within general, median or specific categories, whether it was filed under this or that heading; whatever he did, whichever section of that almost two-thousand-meters' length of archival corridor he dealt with, he was simply keeping history going, if he might put it that way,  while knowing, at the same time, that he was entirely missing the truth, though the fact that he knew, even while he was working, that he was missing it, rendered him calm and equable gave him a certain sense of invulnerability, the kind that comes to a man who recognizes that what he is doing is as pointless as it is meaningless, and furthermore that, precisely because it lacks point and meaning, it is accompanied by an entirely mysterious yet quite inimitable sweetness - yes, that was the way it was, he said, he really did find freedom through work, and there was just one problem, which was that this freedom wasn't quite enough, for, having tasted it these last few months and having realized how rare and precious it was, it suddenly seemed insufficient, and he had started to sigh and pine for a greater, an absolute freedom, and thought only of how and where he might find it, until the whole issue became a burning obsession that disturbed him in his work in the records office, because he had to know where to seek it, where absolute freedom might reside.

17.
All this, of course, indeed his whole history, originated in the distant past, said Korin, as far back as the time he first announced the fact that though an utterly mad world had made a madman of him, pure and simple, it didn't mean that that is entirely what he was, for while it would have been stupid to deny that sooner or later, naturally enough, that was how he'd "finish up", or rather, sooner or later, reach a state resembling madness, it was obvious that whatever might in fact happen, madness was not a particularly unfortunate condition that one should fear as being oppressive or threatening, a condition one should be frightened of, no, not in the least, or at least he personally was not scared of it, not for a moment, for it was simply a matter of fact, as he later explained to the seven children, that one day the straw actually did "break the camel's back", for now that he recalled it, the story did not begin beside that certain river but much earlier, well before the riverside events, when he was suddenly seized by a hitherto unknown and unfathomably deep bitterness that resonated through his entire being, a bitterness so sudden that one particular day it simply struck him how bitter, how deathly bitter he was about that which he used to refer to as "the state of things", and that this was not the result of some mood that quickly appeared then disappeared but of an insight that illuminated him like a bolt of lightning, something, he said, that branded him for ever and would remain burning, a lightning-insight that said there was nothing, but nothing worthwhile left in the world, not that he wanted to exaggerate, but that was how it was, there really was nothing worthwhile in his circumstances, nor would there be anything lovely or good ever again, and though this sounded childish, and indeed he recognized that the essential element of that which he had distilled from his entire history, was,  as he was content to acknowledge, childish, he began to peddle this insight regularly in bars, hoping to find someone that, in his "general state of despair", he might regard as one of those "angels of mercy", seeking such a one constantly, determined to tell him everything or to put a pistol to his own head, as he did, he said, without success, thank heaven; so, in other words, though the whole thing was perfectly idiotic, no doubt, that  was how it started, with this sense of bitterness that created a whole "new Korin", from which point on he began to ponder over matters such as how things fitted together, and if their condition were such and such what the implications might be for him personally, and once having understood that there were absolutely no personal implications, and furthermore, having grasped that he had reached his absolute limit, he then decided that he would resign himself to it, to say OK, fine, that's how things are, but then, if that was the case, what should he do, give up? disappear? or what? and it was precisely this question, or rather the fact that he approached this question in such a 'so-what's-the-point-of-it-all' manner, that led directly to the fateful day, meaning that certain Wednesday morning when he concluded that there was nothing for it but to take immediate action, this being the direct conclusion he had reached, albeit by a dauntingly difficult route, and the seven of them here were witnesses, he said, still squatting in the middle of the footbridge, to the daunting difficulty  of it, right from the time by the river when he first understood the complexity of the world, then by developing an ever deepening comprehension which in someone like him, a local historian of some god-forsaken place, involved getting to grips with the inordinate wealth and complexity of possible thought about a world that didn't exist, as well as with the strength to be derived from the creative power of blind faith, and all this while forgetfulness and the constant terror of losing his head crept up on him, so that the taste of freedom he had enjoyed in the records office might carry him through to the end of his quest, after which there would be nowhere left to go and he would have to decide, and indeed declare, that he himself would no longer allow matters to proceed as they might have wanted to proceed, but mount the stage 'as an actor', not as others around him tended to do, did but quite differently, by, for instance, after one enormous effort of thinking, simply leaving, yes, leaving, abandoning the place allotted to him in life, leaving it for ever, not simply in order to be in an indeterminate elsewhere, but, or so the idea came to him, to locate the very center of the world, the place where matters were actually decided, where things happened, a place such as Rome had been, ancient Rome where decisions had been made and events set in motion, to find that place and then quit everything; in other words he decided to pack up his things and seek such a 'Rome'; for why, he asked himself, why spend his time in an archive some two-hundred kilometers south-west of Budapest when he could be sitting at the center of the world, since one way or the other, it would be his last stop on earth? and the idea having come to him it began to crystallize in his constantly aching head and he had even begun to study foreign languages, when, one late afternoon, having stayed behind in the records office, vaguely checking the shelves, as he put it, utterly by chance, he arrived at a shelf he had never before explored, took down from it a box that had never been taken down, not at least since the Second World War, that was for sure, and from this box labeled  'Family Papers of no Particular Significance' took out a fascicule headed IV.3 / 1941-42, opened it and, in doing so, changed his life for ever, for there he discovered something that decided for once and for all what he should do if he still wanted to 'carry his plan through' and to make 'his last goodbyes'; something that finally determined him to put all those years of thinking, proposing and doubting behind him, to let those years go, to let them rot in the past, and not to let them determine his future but to act  right now, for the fascicule headed IV.3 / 1941-2 had left him in no doubt what should be done, what to do in order to recover the dignity and meaning whose loss he had been mourning,, what important thing there remained for him to do, and above all, where he should seek that which he so much lacked: that peculiar, furiously desired, greatest, very last freedom that earthly life was capable of offering.

The only things that interested them, they said the next day while hanging about in front of the Bingo Bar, were the feeding-catapults, the kind used by anglers for bait, not the mind-numbingly idiotic claptrap the geezer spewed continuously, without any prospect of an end, for he was incapable of stopping, so that eventually, after an hour or so of it, it became clear that it was his own repulsive gabble that had turned him into a head-case, though as far as they were concerned, they said, it didn't add up to anything, so it was completely pointless for him to talk himself into a frazzle, since the geezer meant as much to them as the wind on the footbridge, wind, that, like him, just kept blowing because it was impossible to shut either of them up, not that they gave it a thought, why would they? since he was not worth it, let him talk wind, the only things that mattered being the three feeding-catapults, how they worked and how they would employ them when the six-forty-eight arrived, and that was what they'd all been thinking about just before this creep arrived, of the three professional model ground-baiting catapults they had got as a bargain, for nine-thousand Forints, at the Attila József flea market, the three professional German ground-baiting catapults they had tucked under their bomber jackets, and they wondered how these would perform, for people said their projectile power was vastly greater than that of the Hungarian sort, and, of course, far superior to that of hand-held missiles, some people even claiming that this German gear was not only more powerful but almost ensured that your aim was one hundred-percent effective, and that it was, according to its reputation, no argument about it, the best on the market, chiefly because of the track-device, attached to the handle below the fork, that steadied your hand in case it accidentally trembled, thereby reducing the uncertainty factor to a minimum by holding the arm firm all the way to the elbow, or so it was said, they declared, or so they say, but not in their wildest dreams would they have imagined what really happened after that, since this piece of goods was brilliant, its capacity absolutely phenomenal, they said, or so said the four of them who were not among the first to use it, absolutely phenomenal, they said.

19.
Another long goods train rumbled by below them and the footbridge shook gently along its whole length until the train was gone - leaving two blinking red lights in its wake - when the noise of the very last wagon began to fade along with the rattling of wheels, and, in the newly settled silence, after the two red lights disappearing in the distance, just above the rails, no more than a meter high, a flock of bats appeared and followed the train towards the Rákosrendezö, utterly silent, without the least sound, like some medieval battery of ghosts, in close order, at even pace, indeed at a mysteriously even pace, swooping strictly between the parallel lines of the rails, suggesting somehow that they were being drawn towards Budapest or riding in the slipstream of the train as it went, the train that was showing them the way, carrying them, drawing them, sucking them on so that they could travel perfectly effortlessly, with steady, spread wings, reaching Budapest, at a precise height of one meter above the sleepers.

20.
Funnily enough he didn't smoke, said Korin, and he only happened to possess this pack of Marlboros because somewhere on his journey he had to get some change for the coffee machine and the man in the tobacconists he wandered into, would only oblige if he bought a pack of cigarettes, so, what could he do but buy one, but he didn't throw if away because he thought it might come in useful some time, and would you believe it, he added,  he was so pleased that it had actually come in useful, even if he himself had no use for it, or rather, only on one occasion, said Korin raising his index finger, for he had to be honest about it, there was one single moment, and only one, when he would happily have lit a cigarette, which was the time when he returned from the IBUSZ bus company's ticket office without having accomplished his mission, all because of the two male nurses from the Psychiatric Unit; for he was aware of their eyes following him as he walked away, then as they looked at each other, not in any significant way, or at least not yet, not yet in a way that might show they were resolved to act, though soon enough they did start off after him, a fact of which he was absolutely certain without having to look back over his shoulder, for every cell in his body knew they were close behind him, after which, said Korin, he went home, straight home without a thought, and started packing, and though the apartment was already sold, and many of his possessions already cheaply disposed of, a disposal that involved the wholesale liquidation of a terrifying pile of accumulated notes, scraps, diaries, exercise books, photocopies and letters, not to mention photographs, and, apart from his passport, all his official documents including his birth-certificate, his TB card, his personal ID etc, the lot tossed on the fire, and yet, having survived the entire process and come through feeling that no earthly possession remained to burden him, the moment he stepped into his room he experienced a sense of utter despair, because now that he was ready to leave immediately, the very copiousness of his preparations for leaving appeared to be an obstacle: he was incapable of resolving himself to simply go, even though the feeling of long preparation, he said, was misleading because there had not really been 'copious preparations' as such, since one generous hour was all that had been needed for him to free himself of his material possessions and make ready to go, and please imagine, he continued, raising his voice, imagine that one bare hour was enough after all those months of forethought to set out, there and then, on his long journey, to open the door and leave the apartment to which he would never return, a single hour for his plans to be carried out and become reality, to leave everything for ever, but then, just when he was as ready for departure as he could ever be, there he was, stuck, standing plumb in the middle of the cleared apartment, looking around, and without any sense of regret or emotion casting his eyes over the vacancy when he suddenly understood that one hour was enough for any of us to dispose of everything, to stand plumb in the middle of our forsaken apartment and step out into the melancholy womb of the world, said Korin, and well, at that point, he would happily have flicked a lighter and smoked a decent cigarette, which was strange, but all of a sudden he desired the taste of cigarettes and wanted to draw heavily on one, to take a good deep breath, blow out the smoke, nice and slowly, and though this was the only occasion on which he felt like this, and had never desired a cigarette before nor since, not once, never in his life would he understand what it was all about.

21.
For an archivist, said Korin, and especially for a head archivist-in-waiting such as him, there were a great many fields to master, but he can tell them one thing, that no archivist, not even a head-archivist-in-waiting, such as, in fact, he was in all but name, was in possession of essential information regarding the practicalities of travel on the buffers- or guards'-vans of freight trains, and that was why, when in deciding that the nature of his permanently fugitive status was such that he couldn't trust to buses, passenger trains, or even to the exigencies of hitch-hiking, for a person committed to "any route that was fixed and might be inspected at any point" was vulnerable to discovery, identification, and easy arrest, he had set out on this veritably terrifying Calvary, and just imagine what it was like, said Korin, for someone who, as they already knew, had been used to restricting his movements to the four fixed points of his personal compass, to wit his flat, the pub, the archive and, let us say, the nearest shop, and had never - he wasn't exaggerating - really never, not even for an hour, ventured beyond them and now suddenly found himself off limits, in the deserted, wholly unfamiliar back end of some railway yard, stumbling over tracks, balancing on sleepers, keeping an eye on signals and points, ready to dive into a ditch or behind a bush at the first sight of a train or a rail yard employee, for that's how it was, rails, sleepers, signals, points, being constantly prepared to throw himself on the ground, and, right from the start, to leap on or off a moving wagon, while being in a permanent state of anxiety that extended over the whole hundred and twenty kilometers of the journey, anxiety in case he was spotted by a night-watchman, a stationmaster or someone checking the brakes or axles, a terrible experience on the whole, he said, even having got so far, knowing how much was behind him; bad even to think of having undertaken such a journey, for he couldn't say what was the most exhausting, most embittering part of it, the cold that ate into your bones in the brake-van or the fact that he had no idea where he could or dared to sleep, for the space was so narrow that he had no room to stretch his legs and consequently had constantly to be standing up and lying down then standing up again, a process which naturally drained him, not to mention the other privations, for example having nothing but biscuits, chocolates or coffee at railway cafes for sustenance after two days of which he was permanently nauseous, and so you see, he told the seven children, the whole thing, believe me, was shit-awful, not only the cold and lack of sleep, not just the stiff leg or the nausea, no, for even when they had eased off somewhat and everything was generally fine there remained the perpetual anxiety every time the train departed for whatever perfectly appropriate destination was announced on the boards of the engine, that by the time they passed through it, leaving the town or village behind, be that place Békéscsaba. Mezoberény, Gyoma or Szajol, he immediately lost confidence and that uncertainty grew in him mile by mile so that pretty soon he was on the point of leaping off and boarding a train in the opposite direction, though he hadn't ever actually done that, for, he said, for he would invariably decide that there was more choice at a major stop, and then would immediately regret his decision not to leap when there was still time but to stay on, at which point he would feel utterly lost and have to remain on full alert in case the journey took him into still more dangerous territory where anyone might come along - railway workers, night-watchmen, engine-drivers, or whoever - for that would really be the end of everything, and then he would have to leap from the van into any cover that might be on offer, whether that was a ditch, a building or some shrubbery and that was precisely how he come to be here, said Korin, how he arrived, frozen through, desperate for food, for something salty preferably, or actually not too salty, but in any case, if they didn't mind, he would happily move on now and get into the city center for he urgently needed to find some shelter for the night until the MALEV airline ticket-office opened the next morning.

22.
It was remarkable that the chosen pebble, which was about the size of a child's fist, had succeeded at the first attempt in shattering one of the windows, so that they could not only hear it over the clattering of the train but see it too, as one of the many speeding panes of glass broke in a fraction of a second into a thousand tiny splinters and shards, for the train had arrived, as they explained the next day, a few minutes late, they said, but they attacked it as soon as it appeared, rushing down the embankment to the prearranged cover, and as soon as the train hove into sight they leapt into action, firing, three of them with feeding-catapults, three with regular catapults, one with only his bare hands, but all co-ordinated in attack formation, firing, peppering the six-forty eight, so that a window in the first carriage was immediately blown to pieces, not that they were satisfied with that alone but launched a second wave of attacks and had only to watch out for the possible shriek of the emergency brakes, though that was something they had to devote intense attention to in order to make an on-the-spot assessment as to whether the brakes had been applied or not, and no, they hadn't, because there was not a squeal that might signal its possible application, for there was probably overwhelming panic up there by the window where people had been sitting and the whole thing, difficult as it was to figure, they said as they gave a detailed account of the affair in front of the Bingo Bar, was the work of less than a minute, no more perhaps than twenty seconds, or maybe even less, they added, since it's really tough to be precise about it, though one thing was certain, which was that they were, all of them, on full alert, as they had to be, listening out for the possible application of the emergency brake, but since there was no evidence of that in that certain twenty-seconds or so, they tried a second volley, and they could hear its effect, that it struck the carriages on the side with terrific force, with a loud ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta, to show that one of the last volleys had once more reached its target, that another window had been smashed, for they could hear it as the train roared by at terrific speed, making a terrific racket as the glass shattered, though later, when they sized it all up, that is to say once they had withdrawn to a safe distance and, in their own fashion, with ever greater elation, considered the matter in detail, the general feeling was that the second direct hit must have been on the mail-van, whereas the first, and their voices broke with excitement at this, was a perfect bull's-eye, a word they kept repeating, going round and round in circles like a finger tickling a sensitive spot, repeating the words, passing them on, one to the other, so that by the end they were all choking, gagging, gurgling, helplessly rolling on the ground with lunatic laughter, a laughter that, once it had possessed them, would not let go now, and had gripped them in the past, so they kept exclaiming, bull's-eye! all the while clapping each other on the shoulder and hitting each other, repeating: bull's-eye! fuck it all! what about that then! what do you say to that, you prick! you prick! you prick! bundling and pounding each other, crying, bull's-eye! until they were exhausted, at a safe distance from the scene of the crime, from the surmise that they had actually killed someone, without Korin suspecting any of this of course, for he wasn't even sure what happened to the seven children once they had suddenly leapt up and disappeared from the bridge, disappeared like camphor, as if they had never been there at all, all seven of them, all seven storming off into eternity, at which point he too took off, not glancing back, simply running in the opposite direction, anywhere to be away from the place, with but one thought pounding through his head, to be away, away, as far as possible from here, his chest shaking with the single urge, his one imperative in his great haste not to miss the route into town, for that was the point after all, to reach central Budapest and find some place where he could shelter for the night, warm himself and perhaps get a bite to eat, but, failing that, to find some accommodation, some free accommodation, for he couldn't spare the money not knowing how much the ticket next day would cost him, as he explained at the MALEV office, for all he wanted was some place where he would be left in peace, that was all he desired when, quite unexpectedly, he found his way free again, the children suddenly having disappeared, without explanation, without a word, while he, with his stiff leg, no longer clutching the wound that had stopped bleeding, seized the unhoped for chance of escape, running and running until he could run no more, getting ever closer to the denser lights up ahead, slowing to a walk in his exhaustion, utterly drained by the terror he had just endured, so that he no longer cared what people said to him, and frankly he no longer gave a damn whether he ran into his pursuers or not, but stared directly in the eyes of those going the opposite way, confronting them in mid-gaze, seeking the one man that he, in his hungry, spent condition, might find it worth his while to address.

23
That's the kind of person I am, said Korin, and spread his arms wide, having arrived at a crowded place and spotted a young couple, yet immediately conscious of the impossibility of telling them who he was, and of the general lack of interest likely to be evinced by anyone else in the matter, simply adding: You wouldn't happen to know a place where.. where I might spend the night?

24
The music, the venue, the crowds, or rather, that mass of young faces; the dim light, the volume of noise, the wreaths of rolling smoke; the young couple he had addressed and the way they helped him when he, like them, was being frisked at the cash-desk, the way they led him in and explained where things were while constantly reassuring him that, of course, they could solve his problem, the best solution being to enter and remain in the Almássy, where there was likely to be a real hard-core gig, with  Balaton as the main band featuring Mihály Víg, and he needn't worry because it would be the kind of gig that would go on till dawn; and then it struck him, the extraordinarily dense crowd of people, the stench and, by the end, all those dazed, empty, sad eyes everywhere, in other words what with everything happening so suddenly and all at once, said Korin the next day at the MALÉV office, after those long days of solitude followed by the hour of terror when he was attacked on the railway bridge, he suddenly felt utterly exhausted and had barely spent a minute in there before his head ached and he felt dizzy, unable to adjust to anything, his eyes being accustomed to neither the dim light nor the smoke, his ears, after all the mad panic he had been through, unable to cope with the peculiar, quite unbearable racket, and, heaven knows, at first he was incapable even of movement - as he recounted next day - among this  "crush of desperate pleasure seekers", being hemmed-in, rooted to the spot, then gradually swept one way then the other by close groups of perspiring dancers, eventually fighting his way through to the wall where he managed to insert himself between two silent huddles who happened to be hanging about there; and there, and only there at last could he try to come to terms with the noise-level by adopting some kind of defensive posture against it and against all the misfortunes that had so unexpectedly befallen him, to begin to collect himself and assemble his thoughts, for, having reached this point of security, however infernally crowded and chaotic it was, his capacity for thinking had simply been shot to pieces, shot utterly to pieces, and the more he tried to concentrate the more his thoughts fell apart, so he would have far preferred to abandon the idea of thinking altogether and lie down in a corner, but that was out of the question, though that, on the whole, was his last coherent thought in a long time, the last decision he was capable of making while he continued standing there, gazing first at the band while one thought after another disintegrated before rising to the surface, then at the mass of people, then at the band again, attempting, without success, to catch something of the words of the rapid succession of songs, hearing only the odd phrase, such as "it's all over" and "everything's finished", responding chiefly to the ice-cold melancholy of the music that immediately communicated itself to him despite the sheer volume of noise, and he gazed at the three performers, at the green-haired drummer who stood at the back thrashing his drums while solemnly staring straight ahead, at the blond bass-guitarist beside him lazily rocking his body to the rhythm of the music and the singer, a man of roughly the same age as Korin himself, with his microphone at the front whose severe expression suggested terminal exhaustion and the desire to talk of nothing but terminal exhaustion, who occasionally directed his severe expression at the seething mass below him, as if he would happily have climbed off the stage and disappeared for ever but remained there and continued singing, and, to tell the truth, Korin explained, there was something in this ruthless melancholy that incapacitated him, drugged him, defeated him, that tightened his throat, so that frankly, those first two or three hours of the hard-core gig at the Central club in Almássy tér simply offered him no refuge at all.

25.
Teflon heart, they hummed along in chorus with the singer, but pretty soon the THC appeared and there was no problem, only a few jolly little tours of the place as usual, so that, as they said to a close friend on the telephone the next day, having come in with them and disappeared in the heaving throng, they lost sight of him, though he was a truly weird guy the way he came up to them in the square and told them he was such and such a kind of guy, asked them if they knew anywhere to stay; just imagine, they told the friend, that, literally, that was all he said, that he was such and such a kind of guy, without going into any detail as to just what kind of a guy he was, that was the line he took, no shit, eh? and the clothes he wore! that enormous, long dark-gray overcoat smelling of mothballs, his great lanky body and his comparatively tiny, round, bald head with these two big ears sticking out, so he looked fucking brilliant, they repeated time and again, like some old bat on its hind legs, meaning Korin of course, for who would have failed to recognize himself from such a description, and even though he did not forget them, the young boy and the girl who had brought him in, he did not think there was even the glimmer of a chance of seeing them ever again, not, at least, in this crowd, for after two or three hours, having finally warmed himself through and begun to get used to the atmosphere of the place, he ventured away from the wall to seek some sort of bar, to find a drink, above all, not of course, he added to himself, anything alcoholic, for he had utterly forsworn alcohol a few months ago, and so he launched out into the seething mass to buy himself a Coke, a small one at first, then a larger one, then another large one, not the bottled kind but tins from the machine, which were just as satisfying and, after the third, his stomach being full, his hunger had quite vanished, and the evening having worn on into the small hours, he made it his top priority to explore the possibilities of the environment of the Central in Almássy tér, and soon located some of the possible nooks and crannies where he might see out the rest of the night, somewhere security wouldn't find him even should the hard-core gig finish before dawn; and so he traipsed up and down, climbed stairs, tried a few door handles without anyone paying him the slightest attention for, by this time everyone, every boy and every girl, without exception, was wholly, but truly wholly, lost to the world, and he was confronted by an ever growing sea of glassy eyes, stumbling into ever more bodies on his way, some of them choosing to flop against him like sacks, impossible to stand them upright again, so that by the end there was an extraordinary scene wherein, eventually, the whole of Almássy tér was laid out on the floor or stretched over the stairs or collapsed on the stone paving of the toilets, like the remnants of some peculiar battlefield where defeat is an idea that slowly creeps over the combatants, as if radiating from within them, the singer continuing to sing until, finally, he stopped, not, as it struck Korin, at the end of a song, but somewhere in the middle, abrupt as death, removing his guitar and silently, with, if possible, a look more solemn and severe  than before, leaving the stage somewhere at the back in the wings; and since Korin knew by now precisely where he would go to "spend the night" should it ever begin to wind down, as it did now, the singer having ended the evening in his own strange manner, Korin quickly left the hall, took a door to the left, climbed a few stairs to a room behind the stage where they stored scenery, full of junk, folding screens, miscellaneous items of furniture and sheets of plywood that afforded a good hiding place, and he was in the corridor on his way to precisely that point of refuge when suddenly the singer appeared opposite him, his face ravaged, and cast one sharp glance at him, at Korin that is, said Korin, and the thought occurred to him, he added next day,  that this figure storming past him with long strides, his long hair flowing, was probably Mihály Víg, and was briefly flustered but quickly realized that the singer was not in the least interested in what a stranger was doing there, so Korin too walked on and slipped into the scenery store-room, behind a wardrobe and a screen, found a warm piece of curtain material, lay down on it and wrapped the remainder around himself, made himself at home in other words, and the moment he put his head down he not so much fell asleep as fainted from exhaustion.

26
It was an inexpressibly beautiful, unbelievably tranquil scene he found himself in as he sensed in every cell of his body, sensed it, he explained the next day, rather then saw it, because his eyes were closed, his two arms spread and relaxed, his legs slightly open, comfortable, the lush lawn beneath him softer than any down, light breezes playing about him like delicate hands, and the gentle waves of sunlight as intimate and close as breathing. together with the luxuriant vegetation that enfolded him, the animals drowsing in the distant shade, the azure canvas of sky above him, the earth an aromatic mass below, and this and that other thing, he said, infinite, endlessly flowing in an as-yet-incomplete harmony yet permanent, immobile, echoing his own permanence and immobility, lying there, stretching, fixed as if by nails in his horizontal, immersed, practically submerged position, as if peace were this dish of dizzying sweetness and he the table, as if such peace and such sweetness really existed, as if there were such a place and such tranquility, as if such a thing existed, said Korin, as if it were possible.

27.
He couldn't really claim, he told the stewardess at the MALÉV office the next day, to be one of those to whom courage comes readily and without an effort of the will, someone capable of addressing strangers or using the fact that they were both waiting for something as an excuse, but having her, the stewardess, beside him like this, a stewardess who was so lovely with her smile and those two little dimples, he had found himself, having sat down a few minutes ago, tempted to dart brief glances in her direction, but recognizing that this was a shifty way of behaving, he had abstained and would prefer to come clean now and admit that he did in fact want to look at her, hoping that this disclosure might not prove too offensive or sly and that the young lady would not be angry, regarding it neither as a pass nor as a clumsy attempt to draw her into conversation, for nothing was further from his mind, but the stewardess being not only lovely but beautiful in a way that he couldn't forbear to remark on, he hoped she might not regard it as a proposition, oh no, apologies in advance, certainly not a proposition because he was beyond propositioning anyone, he said, it was merely the beauty, the sheer extraordinary beauty he discerned in the young stewardess lady that so overwhelmed him, as she would understand, wouldn't she? said Korin, for it wasn't a case of him, Korin, wishing to be intrusive, but rather of her beauty inadvertently intruding on him, and while he was at it, he added, elaborating on his theme, let him at least in all humility properly introduce himself, György Korin, though he wouldn't really want to delve into his occupation for anything he might say on that subject would pertain only to his past, though he would have plenty to say, particularly today and particularly to her, about himself some other time in future and only then, though the prospect of doing so was pretty dim, and the most he could do for now was to let her know her why he had eventually plucked up courage to speak to her, which was to tell her what a strange, in fact utterly extraordinary dream he had had last night, though he rarely dreamt, or rather hardly ever remembered his dreams, last night being a unique exception, for he not only dreamt but remembered precisely every last detail of the dream, and she should imagine a place of inexpressible beauty, of unbelievable tranquility that he could sense in every cell of his body for though his eyes were closed he could feel his two arms spread out, relaxed, his legs slightly open, comfortable, and she should imagine, he said, a lush lawn, softer than any down, the light breezes playing about him like delicate hands, and, lastly, imagine the gentle waves of sunlight intimate and close as breathing, the density of the luxuriant vegetation that enfolded him and the animals drowsing in the distant shade, with the azure canvas of the sky above and the aromatic mass of soil below, and so on, this thing and that thing, infinite, endlessly flowing in an as-yet-incomplete harmony yet permanent, immobile, echoing his own permanence and immobility, lying there, stretching, fixed as if by nails in his horizontal, immersed, practically submerged position, as if peace were a dish of dizzying sweetness and he the table, as if such peace and such sweetness really existed, as if there were such a place and such tranquility, as if such a thing existed, if you know what I mean, said Korin, as if it were possible, do you see, young lady? the whole experience being so, you know, convincing, though if there was anyone who might be skeptical of such a dream, it would be the dreamer himself, Korin, though there was nothing in his life that had not been unlikely, right from the start, just think of him, György Korin, living in a small provincial town some two-hundred and twenty kilometers south-east of here, though how to begin, it is so damned difficult, really practically impossible to describe how it all began, but, if he didn't bore her, for he had to wait here in any case, he would try to describe one or two minor incidents in his life if only that she might have some idea who he was, who it was talking to her and addressing her, in fact who was it she was having to put up with for having suddenly been addressed like this, without formalities or introductions.

She had, she felt obliged to respond, been runner-up in a beauty contest, and though nothing could have been further from her mind than involving herself in a conversation with the man who had settled himself beside her, this being of all possible options open to her the last she would choose, as she had more than once tried to convey to him, she nevertheless drifted into communication somehow and found herself answering when she should have kept quiet and even responding, if only with a word or two, when she should have turned her head away, so that she was genuinely unaware that she had become involved with a complete stranger in exactly the conversation she had wished to avoid, explaining to him how dog-tired she was, because to take this moment as an example, she had no idea how long she would have to wait, how utterly unaccustomed she was to waiting like this so that she might meet and have the responsibility of escorting a passenger in a wheelchair, an old Swiss lady, and to do something she had never done before, that is to transport her to the airport and assist her onto the night-flight to Rome; and so, in telling him this, she had entered into an informal conversation with this man despite her best intentions, and whether it happened this way or the other, who cares, she didn't particularly mind in the end, she told the others once they were on board, it was only the beginning that was so weird, for she thought she was dealing with a lunatic or something, the kind who talks to himself, but he wasn't that, he was different, perfectly harmless, with rather nice big ears, and she had always had a weakness for big ears because they made the face look sweet, and in any case she could have stood up and left him any time she wanted, but was happy enough for him to tell her practically his entire life story, because it was simply irresistible, she just had to listen, and cross her heart, she did listen, though, to tell the truth, it was hard to know whether he was telling the truth, for could it really be that someone of such advanced age as forty-something, who knows how old exactly, could sell up and go to New York, not because he wanted to make a new life for himself but because he wanted to end his life there, for nowhere else would do, as the man kept saying, but "the very center of the world", which New York might be for all she knew, anyway he was pretty convincing, she continued in the cabin, it was impossible to think otherwise, though it is natural to be a little skeptical in view of everything one hears nowadays, none of it true, and though this man, of course, did not seem to be the sort of person whose word you'd doubt, far from it, in fact after a while she herself had seriously told him such things as she hadn't told anyone else, for they did have to wait an awfully long time, and she had, in this way, so to speak, opened up to him for he himself was so earnest that she grew quite upset, and somehow she kept feeling that she might be the very last person ever to listen to him, it was really that sad, and he was so fulsome in praise of her beauty that he had asked why she did not enter a beauty-contest since she would be sure, absolutely certain, to win it, in response to which she did at last confess that once, in a moment of weakness, she did in fact enter one but had come away so terribly disillusioned with what she saw that she felt quite embittered by the experience of entering in the first place, and it was so nice when his answer to this was that she should not have been named runner-up, because that was clearly ridiculous and wholly unfair, but should have been awarded first prize.

I need a ticket for the next flight, said Korin at the desk, and when he leaned across it to explain the matter to the clerk who was staring into her computer, making it clear to her that this was no ordinary journey, nor he an ordinary traveler, meaning he was not a tourist, not on a family visit, nor was he a businessman, all she said, after a lot of humming, hawing and shaking of heads, was that she would be grateful if he would stop leaning across her desk, and that his one very faint hope of success lay in a so-called "lahsminih" flight, though he would have to wait for that too in order to discover whether it was in fact worth waiting, and so, if in the meantime, he would be so good as to return to his seat. but Korin begged her pardon, asking what that meant, and she had to enunciate it clearly, syllable by syllable, "lahs-min-ih" while he kept turning it over and over in his mind, aloud, until his English lessons of the last few months kicked in and he realized that what she meant to say was probably "last minute", yes, that was it, now he understood, he said, though he was far from understanding anything until, on his puzzled return to the bench, the stewardess explained it to him, though it transpired that he would also need a "so-called visa", and naturally he didn't have one, at which point the stewardess's beautiful face darkened for a minute, and everyone looked at him repeating, Visa? does he, Korin, mean to say he has no visa? but does he know what this means? does he understand that it can take up to a week to obtain a visa? and how can he present himself at the desk with an on-the-spot request for a ticket? indeed, too bad, the stewardess nodded in melancholy fashion, then, seeing how Korin had sunk back beside her in desperation, advised him that he shouldn't despair and that she would have a go, and, so saying, she stepped across to the nearest telephone and began phoning, ringing first one place then another, though because of all the noise Korin couldn't understand a word she was saying, and after half an hour or so someone appeared announcing that it would be all right, sir, regard the problem as solved, and Korin solemnly declared that the stewardess was not only enchantingly lovely, but that she could work magic in other ways too, until the man returned to inform Korin that the visa would cost him fifteen-thousand, fifteen-thousand! Korin repeated aloud, the color draining from his face as he stood up, but the man merely repeated fifteen-thousand, saying Korin could, if he wished, try going to the consulate himself, and stand in the long queue on his own, perhaps returning after three or four days, he might have the time to spare, but if he didn't this was the price, there was not much chance of anything else turning up, in consequence of which Korin excused himself and popped into the toilet, took three five-thousand notes from the lining of his coat, came out and handed the money over to the man who told him that everything would be all right, he could relax, for he would fill the necessary parts of the form out for Korin then take it in and go through all the proper procedures which meant he could stop fretting, it was all in the safest possible hands, he would have his darn visa by that afternoon and could therefore, he winked before disappearing with the appropriate information, take it easy for the next ten years, sleep soundly for ten years; and so Korin told the desk clerk that he would after all have need of a ticket for the next flight, then sat down again beside the stewardess and confessed that he had no idea what would happen to him if the old lady in the pushchair happened to arrive, for, to tell the truth, he had never flown before, had no idea what to do, was in constant need of advice and his prospects, which had brightened so dramatically, would immediately cloud over again if she was required to attend on the old lady with the wheelchair and so leave him.

All eyes in the office were directed at them, from the woman sitting behind the reception counter, through the agents at their desks in the background to the scattered individual browsers of brochures desirous of travel; not a pair of eyes but was fixed on them, on the whole incident, or rather what it signified, for there was no ready explanation for it: for the extraordinary beauty of the stewardess, since how could someone so beautiful be a stewardess or, indeed, a stewardess so beautiful; for the unwashed, smelly figure of Korin in his rumpled greatcoat, for how could someone traveling to America present such an appearance, or conversely, how could someone presenting such an appearance aspire to visit America; and above all for the fact that two such people could be in easy commerce with each other, on the best of terms, lost in a conversation so deep that its ultimate subject was beyond conjecture for it was being conducted in such passionate terms that it conveyed nothing beyond the passion itself, not even hinting at whether they were meeting for the first time or renewing an old acquaintance, both possibilities, as far as the office was concerned, remaining open: in other words the sight of such beauty worn with such regal modesty in combination with a figure of such beggarly degeneracy represented a serious disturbance in the even tenor of official life, indeed, as far as this sphere of existence was concerned, it signified a slowly developing scandal, since the stewardess was certainly no kind of queen, nor Korin a beggar, and therefore all anyone could do was to watch and wait, wait for this curious still-life to disintegrate, to be snuffed out, liquidated, since there could be no doubt that scene on the bench was in fact a kind of still-life, Korin with his degenerate beggarly appearance, his defenseless other-worldliness, and the stewardess with her enchanting body, that body's simmering sensuality; a still-life therefore with peculiar rules of its own meriting the peculiarly intense interest of its environment, as the stewardess herself explained later on the plane, an interest that she herself finally noticed, and when she saw how everyone was looking at them, it confused her, she said, and there was even something frightening about it, about everyone's eyes, the way they were looking at them, how should she put it? as if it were one single face staring and in a truly frightening fashion, frightening and comical, as she told them all about it on the way to Rome.

31
My predecessors were, on the whole, relaxed, said Korin after a period of silence, then, pulling a sour face, he scratched the top of his head and carefully accenting every word, added - but I was always fraught.

The nipples delicately pressed through the warm texture of the snow-white starched blouse while the deep décolletage boldly accentuated the graceful curvature and fragility of the neck, the gentle valleys of the shoulders and the light swaying to and fro of the sweetly compact masses of her breasts, though it was hard to tell whether it was these that drew all eyes inexorably to her, that refused to let the eyes escape, or if it was the short dark-blue skirt that clung to her hips and bound her long thighs tightly together while indicating the lines of her belly, or indeed if it was the lush and sparkling black hair that tumbled over her shoulders and the clear high brow, the beautifully sculpted jaw, the thick soft lips, the pretty slope of the nose, or those shining eyes in the depths of which two unquenchable spots of light glowed and would glow there for ever, that arrested them; in other words men and women caught in that moment in the office were quite unable to decide what it was that had such a spellbinding effect, so spellbinding that they could do nothing but stare at the several parts constituting this fever-inducing beauty, and what was more - bearing in mind the contrast between such a bountiful display of loveliness on the one hand and their own commonplace existence - they stared at her quite openly, the men with crude, long-suppressed hunger and naked desire, the women with a fine attention to the accumulation of detail, from top to bottom and back again, dizzy with the sensation but, driven by a malignant jealousy at the heart of their fierce inspection, surveying her with ever less sympathy, ever greater contempt, remarking, once the thing was over, or rather once this scandalous pair had disappeared separately through the exit of the MALÉV office, the women first, that it wasn't a matter of prejudice, for they too were women, and one woman always regards another in that light, so there could be no question of prejudice, but it was a little much the way this little strumpet of a stewardess, as one or two of them quickly interjected, pretended she was an innocent little angel, a meek, ready-to-please little princess, while, so the women in the office snorted once it was possible to get together behind the desk and address the subject properly, that tight blouse, the ultra-short skirt clinging to her ass giving an occasional glimpse of the long thighs and the white panties between the thighs, and the very fact that every part of this body, literally everything, was clearly on display, and was practically screaming for attention. well, they had seen quite enough of such apparent artlessness before and knew all too well how to work the little dodges that brought out the best but hid that which should be invisible, nor would they say anything but, really! the shameless deception of it, a blatant whore parading herself like some refined, regal presence, that! they all agreed, no-one would be taken in by nowadays, and later on, before they went home, stopping for a brief chat in the park or a bar, the male employees who had witnessed the scene, a customer or two, or managers further up the chain, contributed to the ongoing discussion by adding that such women were on to a winner every time, that she had a fantastic body, and these huge tits that really thrust themselves at you, and what's more, they added, she had a sweetly swaying round ass, and tits like that, and an ass like that,  not forgetting, they added,  a snow-white set of teeth and a charming smile, and given those shapely hips and a bit of graceful movement, and, to top it all, a glance, a perfectly timed glance that told you, you whose throat was quite parched by the sight of her, that you would be wrong, seriously wrong, if you thought that you would be at the receiving end of all this, because the glance also told you that the woman confronting you was a virgin, and what is more precisely the kind of virgin of all virgins who has no idea what she has been created for, in other words, taking it all into account, the men declared as they sat in the park or in the bar, if you took her on, they jabbed their fingers at their listeners, that would be the end of you, and they set out once more to describe the woman they had seen at the MALÉV office from her nipples down to her slender ankles, set out but could never finish what they started, since this woman, they kept repeating, was quite beyond words, because what did they achieve by telling you about the skirt glued to the hips and those long thighs, no more than the hair tumbling over her shoulders, those soft lips, the brow, the chin, the nose, really now, what did it add up to? they asked, for it was impossible, simply impossible to capture her in words, because what one ought to capture in beauty is that which is treacherous and irresistible, or, let's be perfectly honest: she was the vision of a truly magnificent, majestic female animal in a dismally synthetic world of sickness.

33.
If anyone really and truly wished him success in his venture, it was she, declared the stewardess to the other crew members on board, though she was sure, she added, that once she had left him he would quickly have come unstuck and got pretty well nowhere, and most likely his name would have been dropped from the stand-by list by the time the Swiss lady in the wheelchair had turned up - almost three and a half hours late - which was when she had taken her leave of him, pushing the woman through the door of the office, yes, they'd have dropped his name off the list, the stewardess repeated with growing certainty, no doubt about it, absolutely none, not that she knew precisely who it was that would do the dropping, the people who are normally responsible for such decisions, she expected, policemen, psychiatric workers, security personnel, the usual suspects, because the way he looked it was a miracle that he had got within hailing distance of the MALEV office, and no-one who had had the briefest contact with him could believe he would get any further, so why should she believe it, however she might wish it were otherwise, for to get across town, out to the airport at Ferihegy and past the ticket inspectors, the customs people, the security guys, then to go on to America, no, no, no, the stewardess shook her head, it was unimaginable that he could manage all that, and even now, some two hours later, when she thought back over it, it all seemed like a dream to her, not that she had had a dream as strange as that in a long time, she confessed, nor had she any idea what it all added up to, this memory she now had stored away, for she was still too close to it, she couldn't really see anything, had no idea who he actually was, or anything about him except that she had immediately started making excuses for him and defending him without being able to make any categorical statements about him, in other words to defend him from some as-yet-unknown accusation, for example that of lunacy, for though he did at first sight appear to be a lunatic, he was, as she had already said, no fool, but, how should she express it, there was something about him, about this man, that was so solemn, so unusual, so - she felt justified in using the word - so startling in its absolute solemnity, that she couldn't but be struck by his sheer desperation, him being absolutely set on something, even though he couldn't articulate what it was, and no, she wasn't joking, she's not having them on, not just saying all this, and after a good sleep she would get over the experience, and once she was through it all, she said, pointing at herself, through all this 'may I talk to you' business, all this 'intensity', really, it would be she herself who would be thought crazy for getting involved in the first place, right? ah no, not at all, she would quite understand it if her colleagues thought she was crazy, so she would shut up now, leave off the story of this great soul-shaking encounter, and she was sorry to have bored them, and had a good giggle herself among the general merriment, adding only that it was sad the way we meet people by chance, spend time talking to them, acknowledge the fact that they have had some effect on us, then we lose them and never ever see them again, something genuinely sad, whatever anyone says, she repeated, laughing, really very sad.

34
It was Hermes, said Korin, Hermes lay at the heart of everything, that was his starting point, that was the foundation of his deepest intellectual experiences, and though he had never spoken of this to anyone before he simply had to tell the young lady stewardess that it was to Hermes he had been ultimately led, having time after time attempted to discover that hermetically-sealed beginning, had time after time attempted to understand it, to solve it, to get to the bottom of it, and not least of all, to recount it to those people that fate had so far brought him into contact with, to tell them how it was that he realized that he was not intended to be an ordinary archivist, not that he didn't want to be an archivist, for indeed he was most sincerely an archivist, but not an ordinary one, and what he sought to discover, what he constantly sought the answer to, was the reason why he wasn't ordinary; and so he kept going over and over things that had happened, extending his explorations ever further back in time, and there was always something there, something new about his past that made him think, this is it, I've got it, or rather he searched and searched for the source, the origo of this revolution in his life which eventually, some thirty and forty hours ago, had led him here, and to ever newer potential sources and origos, ever newer starting points and beginnings, until he reached the conclusion, he was pleased to say, the actual conclusion he had been seeking and the name of that conclusion was Hermes; for truly, he said, Hermes, for him, was that absolute origo, it was that encounter with the hermetic, the day, the hour he first encountered Hermes, when - if he might so put it - he became acquainted with the world of the hermetic and was afforded a glimpse into it, into that which Hermes presented as a world, the world of which Hermes was the ruler, Hermes, this Greek god, the twelfth of twelve, with his mystery, his lack of fixity, his copiously multi-faceted existence, his secret forms, the dark side of his being shrouded in a deeply suggestive silence who had had such a mesmerizing effect on his imagination, or, more precisely, had completely captured his imaginative faculties and made him restless, had drawn him into a sphere from which there was no escape, for it was like being under the spell or a curse or an incantation, since this is what Hermes was to him, not a god who led but one who misled, swept him off course, destabilized him, called him, drew him aside, seduced him from below, whispered to him from the wings; but why him, him in particular, why this archivist working some two-hundred and twenty kilometers from Budapest, he could not tell, nor should he seek after reasons, he felt, but simply accept that that was the way it was, it was the way he had learned of Hermes, possibly through the Homeric Hymns, or maybe from the psychoanalyst Kerényi, possibly from the marvelous Graves, who the hell knew or cared how, said Korin, this being, if he might so put it that way, the induction phase which was quickly followed by the next phase, the phase of deeper exploration in which the towering, unrivalled work of Walter F. Otto, that is to say his Die Götter Griechenlands, was the sole guide, and in that book exclusively one specific chapter in the Hungarian edition, which he read and re-read until it came to pieces in his hands , which was the point at which restlessness and anxiety entered his life, when things were no longer as they were, the day after which everything looked different, had changed, when the world showed him its most terrifying face, bringing on a sense of dissociation, offering the most terrifying aspect of absolute freedom, since knowledge of Hermes, said Korin, entails the loss of one's sense of being at home in this world, of the sense of belonging, of dependence, of certainty, and this means that suddenly there is an uncertainty factor in the totality of things, because, just as suddenly, it becomes clear that this uncertainty is the only, the sole factor, for Hermes signifies the provisional and relative nature of the laws of being, and Hermes brings and Hermes  takes such laws away, or rather allows them liberty, for that is the whole point of Hermes, said Korin to the stewardess, for whoever is granted a glimpse of him can never again yield himself to any ambition or form of knowledge, because ambition and knowledge are merely ragged cloaks, if he might use such a poetic turn of phrase, that one may adapt or cast off at a whim according to the teachings of Hermes, the god of the roads of night, of night itself, a night whose domain the presence of Hermes extends into day, since as soon as he appears anywhere he immediately changes human life, appearing to let days be, appearing to acknowledge the powers of his Olympian companions, and allowing everything to appear as though life continued to proceed according to the plans and schemes of his own, while whispering to his devotees that life was not quite like this, leading them into the night, showing them the inconceivably complex and chaotic nature of all paths, making them confront the unexpected, the accidental, the out--of-the-blue, the dangerous, the deeply confused and primitive states of possession, death and sexuality, expelling them, in other words, from Zeus's world of light and thrusting them into hermetic darkness, as he had thrust Korin ever since Korin had understood that a glimpse of him had induced a restlessness in his heart, a restlessness that could never cease once Hermes had revealed himself to him, a revelation that quite ruined him, for if there was one thing he did not wish to suggest it was that this discovery, this glimpse of Hermes indicated that he felt any love for Hermes, said Korin, no, he had no love for Hermes whatsoever but was simply frightened of him; and this is how things were, this is what happened and no more than this, that he had been scared by Hermes as would any man have been, any man who had realized at the moment of his ruin that he had been ruined, that is to say had come into the possession of such knowledge as he did not at all wish to possess, as was precisely the case with him, with Korin, for what did he desire that others did not? he had no desire to be different, to stand out from the crowd, he had no such ambitions, preferring relationships and security, homeliness and a clear and simple life, in other words absolutely ordinary things, though he lost these in the blinking of an eye the moment Hermes entered his life, and made of him, as he is happy to admit, a servant, an underling, since from that moment the underling began rapidly to distance himself from his wife, his neighbors and his colleagues, because it seemed hopeless even to try to explain, elaborate, or confess to the fact that it was a Greek god that lay at the root of the unmistakable changes in his behavior, not that he had any chance of getting others to sympathize with him, Korin told the stewardess, for just imagine him turning one day to his wife, or to his colleagues at the archive and saying to them, I am aware that you will have noticed a peculiar change in my behavior, well, it's all on account of a Greek god; just imagine the effect, said Korin, the way his wife would react to such a confession, or his colleagues to this explanation, in other words things could not have turned out otherwise than they did, a quick divorce, the rapid progress from peculiar looks at the office to being ignored, in fact some went so far as to avoid him altogether and refused to acknowledge him in the street, which was, said Korin, deeply hurtful, coming as it did from his own colleagues, people he met every day of his life, being utterly ignored in the street by them, thanks to Hermes, and everything that flowed from that right down to the present moment, not that he was complaining, merely establishing the facts, for what cause had he for complaint, though there was a time when he was no more than a simple, perfectly orthodox archivist who had every hope of progressing to the post of chief archivist, but now instead of that, would you believe it, said Korin, here he as in Budapest, in Budapest, if he might be allowed to jump forward in time, at the Budapest offices of MALÉV where he trusted and genuinely believed that he would receive a visa and a ticket enabling him, Korin, not only to get to the world-famous city of New York, but in doing so to achieve, and here he dropped his voice, the chief aim of his hermetic state of uncertainty, not to mention the fact, he added, that should he desire compensation, which he did not; or did he wish to exchange his state for some other, which he did not; an exchange of states might serve as a form of compensation, and though this kind of exchange was against the rules it was not in fact impossible, for it was not impossible that he might, any day now, get to see the deity, Hermes, personally, at some moment, for such moments did exist, moments when things were really calm, moments when he glanced towards a shady corner, afternoons when he had fallen asleep and woke to a flash of light in the room, or perhaps when it was getting dark and he was rushing somewhere the god might be there beside him, keeping pace with him, visible as the moon, waving his caduceus at something that was not him, in the distance before disappearing.

35
The visa arrived but they were still sitting in the same way in the same place on the bench set out to accommodate those who were waiting, since the old woman had not yet turned up, and on being shown the visa the people at the desk had nothing to add concerning his chances of getting a ticket, telling him off instead, asking him what his problem was, what was he getting so uppity and impatient about constantly jumping up and down like that instead of sitting down calmly and waiting to be called in his turn at the right time, because there were people out there who had been waiting for weeks, to which Korin naturally replied with an acquiescent nod, assuring the staff that he would stop being a nuisance to them, that from now on, having got the point, he would, he promised, no longer impose on them, and so saying, sat back down on the bench beside the stewardess and said nothing for the next few minutes, simply waited, clearly anxious in case his behavior had set the staff against him, which, he explained to the stewardess, would harm no one but him, then, suddenly, as if he had forgotten everything he had said earlier, turned to her again and continued from where he had just now left off, informing her that nothing would please him more than spending the entire week here, in continual conversation with her, though he himself did not quite understand what the hell it was that inspired him to launch out on his monologue, a monologue,  furthermore, that was exclusively about himself, for he had never done anything like this in his life, not once, Korin told the stewardess, gazing into her eyes, for it would have been inconceivable before, in fact if anything characterized him as he had been it was a reluctance to talk about himself, he'd not say a word to anyone on the subject, and if now he felt impelled, it was possibly because he was frightened that he might be attacked, fearing that they were on his trail, which was by no means a certainty, more a simple likelihood, in other words it must be this or some other related cause that made him launch out on this torrent of words, feeling that he had to tell all, the bit about the riverbank, about the psychotherapy, the hierarchy, the amnesia, about freedom and about the center of the world so that he, who had never previously been aware of the least talent for it, might at last initiate someone else into the secret story of the last years, the last months, the last day, telling them what happened at the archive, in the brake car, on the railway bridge and on Almássy Square; telling, in other words, everything, or, to be more accurate, the essential parts, though telling only the truly essential parts was becoming steadily harder, and not only because the whole consisted of individual details, details of which there was a maddening surfeit, but also because - a most humdrum problem - it made his head ache, or to be more precise made the headache he already had exceed its usual intensity so that it was becoming quite unbearable, or rather, he corrected himself, not even so much his head as his neck, his shoulders and the base of his skull, just there, he pointed out to the stewardess, and when you took all these pains into consideration, the whole effect, when it put its mind to it, could become unbearable, and there was nothing he could do about these attacks for nothing would help, not massage, not turning his head this way and that, not moving his shoulders about, nothing, the only cure was sleep, sleep alone could shift it, the complete and utter mental relaxation, the loss of all self-consciousness, though that was precisely the problem, that he never could relax his self-consciousness, never free himself of the tension in his head, he had to hold it just as he was now doing, though, naturally, it led to the cramping of the muscles and strained the ligaments, so that eventually the constitution of his whole upper body was in open revolt, at which he point he had no option, if the young lady would be so kind as to forgive him, but to lie down here in the bench, only for a minute of course, but lie down he must if only to relieve the strain on his muscles and ligaments, from the trapezium and the splenius, from the sub-occipital and the sternocleidomastodeum, for somehow the pressure had to be lifted or else the thing he had long feared would come to pass, that is to say his head would drop off, because that would surely happen, the whole caboodle would just collapse, and then there would be no New York, no nothing, said Korin, it would all be over before you could say Jack Robinson.

The stewardess stood up to make room for Korin, who gradually, carefully, arranged himself full-length along the bench but no sooner had he closed his eyes than he had to snap them open again because the door to the street was suddenly thrown open and a whole crowd of people thrust themselves through it, or to put it more precisely, erupted into the office with such brutal force it seemed they wanted to smash everything in their way, impatient of the slightest objection, shouting harsh instructions left and right, fore and aft, to the effect that the person they were delivering, who was now shoved forward in a brilliantly glistening ebony-black wheelchair, and who was now advancing through the ranks of would-be ticket purchasers and employees, had a quite particular reason for bursting in like this and had an absolute right to run people down while no one had any cause or justification to question this privilege, in other words, albeit half a day late, and to Korin's deepest disappointment but to the stewardess's great relief, the old woman from Switzerland had finally arrived in her very own skin-and-bone, dried-out body, her face fallen-in and scored over with a thousand wrinkles, her gray eyes tiny and lightless, her lips cracked, her ears decked out in an outsize set of gold earrings that dangled right down to her shoulders, her whole presence immediately, silently, declaring that it was with precisely this body, this face, these eyes, these lips and just these enormous earrings that she intended to determine what was going or not going to happen in the next few minutes; nor did she in fact say anything at all, and as to her entourage, it was clear that there was no communication of orders to them either, it being more a case of now a little this way, now a little faster, now a touch slower, while keeping their eyes firmly glued to her, hanging on to her the way the golden earrings did to her ears, until, with one gesture as minimal as the act of breathing she made it clear what she wanted, which way she wanted to go, which route they should take to which desk, a decision that neither the employees nor those waiting for tickets had any power to resist, for those behind the desks stopped working and the queues broke up, simultaneously bringing to an end the situation in which Korin, still cursed with his headache, and the stewardess found themselves, since Korin had, at the very least, after the first moment of terror, to sit up in order to convince himself that the deputation had not come for him, and the stewardess had to snap into action and announce that it was she whom MALÉV had, after the necessary formalities, together with the Helping Hands service, chosen to conduct the elderly lady to her chosen, specially selected flight, where she would be her supporter and aide, to be in the strict sense of the word, her guide on the road to the airport at Ferihegy.

37
The meat-filled pancake a la Hortobágy was fine, the old lady's translator conveyed to the nervous official, but the air - and here every member of the entourage allowed himself a smile - did not meet with Frau Hanzl's approval, no, eure Luft, as the old lady repeated in her loud, cracked rather masculine voice, shaking her head in a disillusioned manner, ist einfach unqualifizierbar, versteht ihr?, unqualifizierbar! after which, having indicated that she wished the computer monitor to be turned in her direction, she jabbed her finger at one of the lines, from which point everything happened improbably fast: no more than a minute or two had elapsed before her entourage was in full possession of a ticket and the stewardess had been informed what her duties were to be regarding "the acutely sensitive Mrs Hanzl who was in the habit of making all her own arrangements for travel", and the shiny ebony-black wheelchair containing the acutely sensitive Mrs Hanzl, was already turning and thundering across the hall towards the exit so that Korin, who was looking this way and that in panic had barely time enough to dash over to the stewardess and condense into a single sentence everything she absolutely had to know, since, he stared at her in desperation, there was so much he had not had time to say, the most important things in fact, having neglected to inform her of the very reason he had to get to New York and what he had to do there, indicating his coat sleeve and the manuscript of which he had not said a word so far though it was by far the most important aspect of the whole thing and the stewardess would understand nothing if she did not know that, for that manuscript - he grabbed her hand and tried to delay the gathering momentum of the procession - was the most extraordinary piece of writing that anyone had ever produced, but he could talk to the stewardess all he liked for she was no longer listening, having only time enough to smile and beg his forgiveness for having to get on now, in response to which Korin himself could do no more than run ahead, to prop the door open before the onrushing pushchair, and raise his voice above the din of the agitated procession of escorts to remark what a wonderful, unforgettable day it had been, and that the young stewardess lady should allow him to file away the two tiny dimples of her smile in his memory for ever, to which she replied smiling, with precisely those two tiny dimples, that he was most welcome to file them away, whereupon she waved and disappeared behind the closing door, leaving Korin alone in the suddenly ear-splitting silence with only the eternal memory of those two little dimples to console him.

38
For 119,00 forints he could have a week in Iceland, one bored official told him, rattling the figures off; for 99,900 a week on the Nile, for 98,000 a week in Tenerife, for 75,900 five days in London, 69,000 for a week in Cyprus or Mallorca, 49,900 for a week on the Turkish Riviera, 39,900 for a week in Rhodes, 34,900 for the same in Corfu, 24,900 for Dubrovnik or Athens-Thessaloniki, 24,000 for a week at the Cloisters in Meteora, Jesolo was 22,900, Salou in Spain 19,900, or he could have eight days in Kraljevica for 18,200 forints, and if none of those appealed to him, he told the customer standing at the desk, for he appeared to be dithering, then, the agent turned his head away and made a moue with his mouth, he was perfectly free to go elsewhere, and so saying he pressed a button on his computer, tipped his chair back and stared at the ceiling with an expression that clearly declared that he, for his part, had given out as much information as he felt bound to and was not going to give out one jot more.

39
What ticket for what flight? Korin enquired at the desk later when they called him up to tell him the news, and started massaging his forehead the way people do when they want to summon up their lost concentration, cutting the operative short by asking: Tomorrow? What do you mean tomorrow?

40
There were four of them altogether, three female adults aged between fifty and sixty, and a girl who looked about eighteen but was certainly no more than twelve years old, each of them arriving with a steel bucket full of cleaning apparatus and carrying a half-sized industrial broom in her left hand: four buckets, four brooms and four sets of gray cleaners' lab-coats, ensuring their clear identification and function and explaining why they were now ready and waiting for something, squinting upward at everyone else, fixed in this inferior position keeping their eyes peeled for a sign from their supervisor who stood in the doorway of a glass cubicle, and when the sign eventually came they were set to go about their business, carefully at first, with a number of uncertain preparatory gestures, then, as the last of the officials and employees disappeared through the door, and the shutters at the front clattered down, switching to full speed with the brooms and buckets, the four of them in their uniforms, two in front, two remaining on the street side, wringing out the cloths wound round the brooms then dipping them into water again, the brooms dripping, two on one side, two on the other, the cleaners taking long extended strides, solemnly, without a word, so that the only sound audible was of the four improvised mops sliding quickly across the fake-marble slabs of the floor, and then, as they reached the center and passed each other, one or two slight smacking sounds, then that sliding noise across the paving again, to the end of the room, then a dipping and wringing and back again, as wordless as before, until the girl reached into the pocket of her coat to turn on a small transistor, turning up the volume, so from that moment they moved in a dense, echoing, monotonous aspic of sound, like machines, with brooms in their hands, their empty whey-coloured eyes fixed on their damp mops.
@ Nothing


For Carl Solomon 

I

I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked,

dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix,

angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night,

who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in the supernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities contemplating jazz,

who bared their brains to Heaven under the El and saw Mohammedan angels staggering on tenement roofs illuminated,

who passed through universities with radiant eyes hallucinating Arkansas and Blake-light tragedy among the scholars of war,

who were expelled from the academies for crazy & publishing obscene odes on the windows of the skull,

who cowered in unshaven rooms in underwear, burning their money in wastebaskets and listening to the Terror through the wall,

who got busted in their pubic beards returning through Laredo with a belt of marijuana for New York,

who ate fire in paint hotels or drank turpentine in Paradise Alley, death, or purgatoried their torsos night after night

with dreams, with drugs, with waking nightmares, alcohol and cock and endless balls,

incomparable blind streets of shuddering cloud and lightning in the mind leaping towards poles of Canada & Paterson, illuminating all the motionless world of Time between,

Peyote solidities of halls, backyard green tree cemetery dawns, wine drunkenness over the rooftops, storefront boroughs of teahead joyride neon blinking traffic light, sun and moon and tree vibrations in the roaring winter dusks of Brooklyn, ashcan rantings and kind king light of mind,

who chained themselves to subways for the endless ride from Battery to holy Bronx on benzedrine until the noise of wheels and children brought them down shuddering mouth-wracked and battered bleak of brain all drained of brilliance in the drear light of Zoo,

who sank all night in submarine light of Bickford's floated out and sat through the stale beer afternoon in desolate Fugazzi's, listening to the crack of doom on the hydrogen jukebox,

who talked continuously seventy hours from park to pad to bar to Bellevue to museum to the Brooklyn Bridge,

a lost batallion of platonic conversationalists jumping down the stoops off fire escapes off windowsills off Empire State out of the moon

yacketayakking screaming vomiting whispering facts and memories and anecdotes and eyeball kicks and shocks of hospitals and jails and wars,

whose intellects disgorged in total recall for seven days and nights with brilliant eyes, meat for the Synagogue cast on the pavement,

who vanished into nowhere Zen New Jersey leaving a trail of ambiguous picture postcards of Atlantic City Hall,

suffering Eastern sweats and Tangerian bone-grindings and migraines of China under junk-withdrawal in Newark's bleak furnished room,

who wandered around and around at midnight in the railway yard wondering where to go, and went, leaving no broken hearts,

who lit cigarettes in boxcars boxcars boxcars racketing through snow toward lonesome farms in grandfather night,

who studied Plotinus Poe St John of the Cross telepathy and bop kabbalah because the universe instinctively vibrated at their feet in Kansas,

who loned it through the streets of Idaho seeking visionary indian angels who were visionary indian angels,

who thought they were only mad when Baltimore gleamed in supernatural ecstasy,

who jumped in limousines with the Chinaman of Oklahoma on the impulse of winter midnight streetlight smalltown rain,

who lounged hungry and lonesome through Houston seeking jazz or sex or soup, and followed the brilliant Spaniard to converse about America and Eternity, a hopeless task, and so took ship to Africa,

who disappeared into the volcanoes of Mexico leaving nothing behind but the shadow of dungarees and the larva and ash of poetry scattered in fireplace Chicago,

who reappeared on the West Coast investigating the FBI in beards and shorts with big pacifist eyes sexy in their dark skin passing out incomprehensible leaflets,

who burned cigarette holes in their arms protesting the narcotic tobacco haze of Capitalism, who distributed Supercommunist pamphlets in Union Square weeping and undressing while the sirens of Los Alamos wailed them down, and wailed down Wall, and the Staten Island ferry also wailed,

who broke down crying in white gymnasiums naked and trembling before the machinery of other skeletons,

who bit detectives in the neck and shrieked with delight in policecars for committing no crime but their own wild cooking pederasty and intoxication,

who howled on their knees in the subway and were dragged off the roof waving genitals and manuscripts,

who let themselves be fucked in the ass by saintly motorcyclists, and screamed with joy,

who blew and were blown by those human seraphim, the sailors, caresses of Atlantic and Caribbean love,

who balled in the morning in the evenings in rosegardens and the grass of public parks and cemeteries scattering their semen freely to whomever come who may, 

who hiccuped endlessly trying to giggle but wound up with a sob behind a partition in a Turkish Bath when the blond & naked angel came to pierce them with a sword,

who lost their loveboys to the three old shrews of fate the one eyed shrew of the heterosexual dollar the one eyed shrew that winks out of the womb and the one eyed shrew that does nothing but sit on her ass and snip the intellectual golden threads of the craftsman's loom,

who copulated ecstatic and insatiate and fell off the bed, and continued along the floor and down the hall and ended fainting on the wall with a vision of ultimate cunt and come eluding the last gyzym of consciousness,

who sweetened the snatches of a million girls trembling in the sunset, and were red eyed in the morning but were prepared to sweeten the snatch of the sunrise, flashing buttocks under barns and naked in the lake,

who went out whoring through Colorado in myriad stolen night-cars, N.C., secret hero of these poems, cocksman and Adonis of Denver—joy to the memory of his innumerable lays of girls in empty lots & diner backyards, moviehouses' rickety rows, on mountaintops in caves or with gaunt waitresses in familiar roadside lonely petticoat upliftings & especially secret gas-station solipsisms of johns, & hometown alleys too,

who faded out in vast sordid movies, were shifted in dreams, woke on a sudden Manhattan, and picked themselves up out of basements hungover with heartless Tokay and horrors of Third Avenue iron dreams & stumbled to unemployment offices,

who walked all night with their shoes full of blood on the snowbank docks waiting for a door in the East River to open full of steamheat and opium,

who created great suicidal dramas on the appartment cliff-banks of the Hudson under the wartime blue floodlight of the moon & their heads shall be crowned with laurel in oblivion,

who ate the lamb stew of the imagination or digested the crab at the muddy bottom of the rivers of the Bowery,

who wept at the romance of the streets with their pushcarts full of onions and bad music,

who sat in boxes breathing in the darkness under the bridge, and rose up to build harpsichords in their lofts, who coughed on the sixth floor of Harlem crowned with flame under the tubercular sky surrounded by orange crates of theology,

who scribbled all night rocking and rolling over lofty incantations which in the yellow morning were stanzas of gibberish,

who cooked rotten animals lung heart feet tail borsht & tortillas dreaming of the pure vegetable kingdom,

who plunged themselves under meat trucks looking for an egg,

who threw their watches off the roof to cast their ballot for an Eternity outside of Time, & alarm clocks fell on their heads every day for the next decade,

who cut their wrists three times successfully unsuccessfully, gave up and were forced to open antique stores where they thought they were growing old and cried,

who were burned alive in their innocent flannel suits on Madison Avenue amid blasts of leaden verse & the tanked-up clatter of the iron regiments of fashion & the nitroglycerine shrieks of the fairies of advertising & the mustard gas of sinister intelligent editors, or were run down by the drunken taxicabs of Absolute Reality,

who jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge this actually happened and walked away unknown and forgotten into the ghostly daze of Chinatown soup alleyways & firetrucks, not even one free beer,

who sang out of their windows in despair, fell out of the subway window, jumped in the filthy Passaic, leaped on negroes, cried all over the street, danced on broken wineglasses barefoot smashed phonograph records of nostalgic European 1930s German jazz finished the whiskey and threw up groaning into the bloody toilet, moans in their ears and the blast of colossal steamwhistles,

who barreled down the highways of the past journeying to each other's hotrod-Golgotha jail-solitude watch Birmingham jazz incarnation,

who drove crosscountry seventytwo hours to find out if I had a vision or you had a vision or he had a vision to find out Eternity,

who journeyed to Denver, who died in Denver, who came back to Denver & waited in vain, who watched over Denver & brooded & loned in Denver and finally went away to find out the Time, & now Denver is lonesome for her heroes,

who fell on their knees in hopeless cathedrals praying for each other's salvation and light and breasts, until the soul illuminated its hair for a second,

who crashed through their minds in jail waiting for impossible criminals with golden heads and the charm of reality in their hearts who sang sweet blues to Alcatraz,

who retired to Mexico to cultivate a habit, or Rocky Mount to tender Buddha or Tangiers to boys or Southern Pacific to the black locomotive or Harvard to Narcissus to Woodlawn to the daisychain or grave,

who demanded sanity trials accusing the radio of hypnotism & were left with their insanity & their hands & a hung jury,

who threw potato salad at CCNY lecturerson Dadaism and subsequently presented themselves on the granite steps of the madhouse with the shaven heads and harlequin speech of suicide, demanding instantaneous lobotomy,

and who were given instead the concrete void of insulin Metrazol electricity hydrotherapy psychotherapy occupational therapy pingpong & amnesia,

who in humorless protest overturned only one symbolic pingpong table, resting briefly in catatonia,

returning years later truly bald except for a wig of blood, and tears and fingers, to the visible madman doom of the wards of the madtowns of the East,

Pilgrim State's Rockland's and Greystone's foetid halls, bickering with the echoes of the soul, rocking and rolling in the midnight solitude-bench dolmen-realms of love, dream of life a nightmare, bodies turned to stone as heavy as the moon,

with mother finally *****, and the last fantastic book flung out of the tenement window, and the last door closed at 4 A.M. and the last telephone slammed at the wall in reply and the last furnished room emptied down to the last piece of mental furniture, a yellow paper rose twisted on a wire hanger on the closet, and even that imaginary, nothing but a hopeful little bit of hallucination—

ah, Carl, while you are not safe I am not safe, and now you're really in the total animal soup of time—

and who therefore ran through the icy streets obsessed with a sudden flash of the alchemy of the use of the ellipse the catalog the meter & the vibrating plane,

who dreamt and made incarnate gaps in Time & Space through images juxtaposed, and trapped the archangel of the soulbetween 2 visual images and joined the elemental verbs and set the noun and dash of consciousness together jumping with sensation of Pater Omnipotens Aeterna Deus

to recreate the syntax and measure of poor human prose and stand before you speechless and intelligent and shaking with shame, rejected yet confessing out the soul to conform to the rhythm of thought in his naked and endless head,

the madman bum and angel beat in Time, unknown, yet putting down here what might be left to say in time come after death,

and rose incarnate in the ghostly clothes of jazz in the goldhorn shadow of the band and blew the suffering of America's naked mind for love into an eli eli lamma lamma sabacthani saxophone cry that shivered the cities down to the last radio

with the absolute heart of the poem butchered out of their own bodies good to eat a thousand years.

     Inside Dachau


1. big lies, small lies

Having lied to our German hosts about our plans 
for the day, Diane and I visited Dachau 
instead of searching for rare albums in Munich. 
Only a dozen visitors walked through the camp 
because we were months away from tourist season. 
The camp was austere. The museum was simple.

Once there, I had expected to feel simple 
emotions: hate, anger, sorrow. That was my plan. 
I would write poetry about how the season 
of winter found a perfect home in cold Dachau. 
I would be a Jewish man who died in the camp. 
I would be the ideal metaphor. Munich

would be a short train ride away from hell. Munich 
would take the blame. I thought it would all be simple 
but there were no easy answers inside the camp. 
The poems still took their forms, but my earlier plans 
seemed so selfish. What could I say about Dachau 
when I had never suffered through any season

inside its walls? Could I imagine a season 
of ash and snow, of flames and shallow graves? Munich 
is only a short train ride away from Dachau. 
If you can speak some German, it is a simple 
journey which requires coins and no other plans 
for the day. We lied about visiting the camp

to our German hosts, who always spoke of the camp 
as truthfully as they spoke about the seasons. 
Dachau is still Dachau. Our hosts have made no plans 
to believe otherwise. As we drove through Munich 
our hosts pointed out former Nazi homes, simply 
and quickly. "We are truly ashamed of Dachau,"

Mikael said, "but what about all the Dachaus
in the United States? What about the death camps 
in your country?" Yes, Mikael, you ask simple 
questions which are ignored, season after season. 
Mikael, I'm sorry we lied about Munich 
and Dachau. I'm sorry we lied about our plans.

Inside Dachau, you might believe winter will never end. You may lose faith in the change of seasons
because some of the men who built the camps still live in Argentina, in Washington, in Munich.
They live simple lives. They share bread with sons and daughters who have come to understand the master plan.

 

2. history as the home movie

it begins and ends with ash, though we insist
on ignoring the shared fires in our past.
We attempt to erase our names from the list
            that begins and ends with ash.
We ignore the war until we are the last 
standing, until we are the last to persist 
in denial, as we are shipped off to camps

where we all are stripped, and our dark bodies lit 
by the cruel light of those antique Jew-skinned lamps. 
Decades after Dachau fell, we stand in mist 
            that begins and ends with ash.

4. the american indian holocaust museum

What do we indigenous people want from our country?
We stand over mass graves. Our collective grief makes us numb. 
We are waiting for the construction of our museum.

We too could stack the shoes of our dead and fill a city 
to its thirteenth floor. What did you expect us to become? 
What do we indigenous people want from our country? 
We are waiting for the construction of our museum.

We are the great-grandchildren of Sand Creek and Wounded Knee. 
We are the veterans of the Indian wars. We are the sons 
and daughters of the walking dead. We have lost everyone. 
What do we indigenous people want from our country? 
We stand over mass graves. Our collective grief makes us numb. 
We are waiting for the construction of our museum.

 

5. songs from those who love the flames

We start the fires
on the church spire:
ash, ash.
We build tall pyres
from children's choirs:
ash, ash.
We watch flames gyre
and burn the liars:
ash, ash.

If I were Jewish, how would I mourn the dead?
I am Spokane. I wake.

If I were Jewish, how would I remember the past?
I am Spokane. I page through the history books.

If I were Jewish, how would I find the joy to dance?
I am Spokane. I drop a quarter into the jukebox.

If I were Jewish, how would I find time to sing?
I am Spokane. I sit at the drum with all of my cousins.

If I were Jewish, how would I fall in love?
I am Spokane. I listen to an Indian woman whispering.

If I were Jewish, how would I feel about ash?
I am Spokane. I offer tobacco to all of my guests.

If I were Jewish, how would I tell the stories? 
I am Spokane. I rest my hands on the podium.

If I were Jewish, how would I sleep at night?
I am Spokane. I keep the television playing until dawn.

If I were Jewish, how would I find my home?
I am Spokane. I step into the river and close my eyes.

 

7. below freezing

Dachau was so cold I could see my breath 
so I was thankful for my overcoat.
I have nothing new to say about death

Each building sat at right angles to the rest. 
Around each corner, I expected ghosts.
Dachau was so cold I could see my breath.

Everything was clean, history compressed 
into shoes, photographs, private notes. 
I have nothing new to say about death.

I wanted to weep. I wanted to rest
my weary head as the ash mixed with snow. 
Dachau was so cold I could see my breath.

I am not a Jew. I was just a guest
in that theater which will never close. 
I have nothing new to say about death.

I wonder which people will light fires next
and which people will soon be turned to smoke. 
Dachau was so cold I could see my breath. 
I have nothing new to say about death.



I Would Steal Horses

For Kari 

for you, if there were any left,
give a dozen of the best
to your father, the auto mechanic
in the small town where you were born

and where he will die sometime by dark.
I am afraid of his hands, which have
rebuilt more of the small parts
of this world than I ever will.

I would sign treaties for you, take
every promise as the last lie, the last
point after which we both refuse the exact.

I would wrap us both in old blankets
hold every disease tight against our skin.



Little Big Man 

I got eyes, Jack, that can see 
an ant moving along the horizon
can pull four bottles shattering
down from the sky and recognize
the eyes of a blind man

who told me once, The future is yours
and I believed him until he left me
without a campfire, without an axe
to chop down a tree and build myself
a chair, house, cold drink.

Jack, how much pain is thre
in the world? I think there's only one kind
and we all keep moving around it in circles
like clumsy pioneers, over the same ground
until the landscape becomes so familiar
we settle down and call it home.

Seems like everybody wants to be an Indian.
Why should you be any different, Jack?
Still, when you rub the red dirt off your pale nose
your little insanities vanish.
Listen: the proof is glass.
When an Indian looks through a window
it's like a mirror. When the Indian looks
into a mirror, it's like a window.

I know you have dreams, Jack. We all want
an acre of land, love, and a full stomach.
Without that, we couldn't listen to the wind
without anger. But I've been sitting in a cold room
watching stars through a hole in the roof.
That bright star to the north doesn't have a name
I know. Like everything else, it will break my heart.

What the Orphan Inherits


Language

I dreamed I was digging your grave
with my bare hands.  I touched your face
and skin fell in thin strips to the ground

until only your tongue remained whole.
I hung it to smoke with the deer
for seven days.  It tasted thick and greasy

sinew gripped my tongue tight.  I rose
to walk naked through the fire. I spoke
English.  I was not consumed.


Names 
I do not have an Indian name.
The wind never spoke to my mother
when I was born.  My heart was hidden
beneath the shells of walnuts switched
back and forth.  I have to cheat to feel
the beating of drums in my chest.


Alcohol 
“For bringing us the horse
we could almost forgive you
for bringing us whisky.”


Time
Indian boys
Sinewy and doe-eyed
Frozen in headlights.

 

 

Poverty of Mirrors

You wake these mornings alone and nothing
can be forgiven; you drink the last
swallow of warm beer from the can
beside the bed, tell the stranger sleeping
on the floor to go home. It's too easy

to be no one with nothing to do, only
slightly worried about the light bill
more concerned with how dark day gets.

You walk alone on moist pavement wondering
what color rain is in the country.
Does the world out there revolve around rooms
without doors or windows? Centering the mirror
you found in the trash, walls seem closer
and you can never find the right way

out, so you open the fridge again
for a beer, find only rancid milk and drink it
whole. This all tastes too familiar.

 

Memorial Day, 1972

I was too young to clean graves
so I waded into the uranium river
carrying the cat who later gave birth
to six headless kittens.

O, Lord, remember, O, do remember me.

 

Water

I know a woman
who swims naked
in the ocean
no matter the season.

I don't have a reason
for telling you this (I never
witnessed her early morning
dips into the salt) other than
to let you know that I once found
the thought of her nudity erotic

but now can only imagine 
the incredible cold, how I would want
to cover her body with my coat
and tell her how crazy she is
for having so much faith
in two parts hydrogen, one part oxygen.

2.

While reading a mystery novel (I
don't remember the title), I

dropped a cup of hot tea
into my lap. Third degree burns

on my thighs, penis, and scrotum. I
still have the scars and once told

a white woman they were the result
of a highly sacred Spokane Indian adulthood ceremony.

3.

I knew a man
who drowned in three inches of water.

Rain collected
in a tire track.

His family and friends accuse me
of making light

of his death, but I insist
on my innocence. Lord, I think

his death is tragic, possibly epic
the first and last act

of a reservation opera, and I wish
I could use his name here, make him

remembered, but I am forbidden
from doing so by tribal laws

that are more important than any poem.
But I want to give him a name

that means what I say, and I so I name him
Hamlet, King Lear, Othello, Noah, Adam.

4.

Boo tells me, "Whenever I feel depressed or lonely
I drink a glass of water and immediately feel better."

5.

In the unlikely event of a water landing
you can use your seat cushion as a floatation device.

I worry about this.

I wonder if the puny cushion can possibly support
my weight. I am a large man. In the unlikely event
of a water landing, you can use your seat cushion
as a floatation device. Of course, we don't crash.
We land safely. We always land safely. And Ha! Ha!
the flight attendant tells the disembarking passengers
to drive safely away from the airport because driving is
so much more dangerous, statistically speaking, than flying.

I want to slap her across the mouth, statistically speaking.

In the unlikely event of a water landing, you can use
your seat cushion as a floatation device. I am suddenly afraid
of gravity so I take my seat cushion off the plane. I steal
the damn thing and run through the airport, chased
by an ever increasing number of security people, 
men and women, so I'm glad this airport has progressed
beyond an antiquated notion of gender roles. But wait, 

I have no time to be liberal, I have to run fast, so I do run fast
with that seat cushion pressed tightly against my chest.
I cannot run fast enough in such an awkward position
as I am a large man with large hands. I cannot easily hide.
I cannot blend into the crowd. I cannot duck behind
the counter of the Burger King and ask for your order, your order, your
order.

Oh, in the event of a water landing, you can use your seat cushion
as a floatation device, and here I am, running, and praying as I run,
every step shouting Lord, Lord, Lord, every other step whispering

amen, amen, amen.

6.

At the restaurant, I ask the waiter to leave the pitcher of water
because I drink lots of water.

I can't do that, he says.

Why not? I ask.

Because we never leave the pitcher, he says.

Not once? I ask.

Never, he says, have we ever left a whole pitcher of water, not once 
in the entire history of this restaurant. It is impossible for us to do so. 
It is inconceivable for us to even consider such a thing. Who knows
what would happen if we set such a precedent?

7.

When I was seven, I took swim lessons at the YMCA
from three beautiful teenagers who all seemed like women to me.

They hugged me when they saw me waiting in line
to see JAWS at the Fox Theater in downtown Spokane.

Where are those girls now? Somewhere, they are being women.

Do they remember teaching me how to swim? Do they
recognize my face when they pick up the local newspaper
or see my photograph on the back of my latest book?

Oh, strange, strange ego.

Here, I've decided I want them to love me from afar. I want them
to regret their whole lives because they were once sixteen years old
swimmers who never stopped to passionately kiss
the seven year old me, as I floated
from the deep end of the pool back to the shallow.

8.

My brother, the big one, says, "It ain't water
unless it's got some Kool-aid in it."

9.

My wife, the Hidatsa Indian, grew up in Southern California
with a swimming pool. Wow!

Her father, the trickster, called relatives back home
in North Dakota. Called them in late December
when trees were exploding in the high plains cold. 
Called them and said, He held the phone up to the air, toward
the empty pool, because it was too cold to swim in December, even
in Southern California, but the North Dakota Indians didn't know
any better, so they were jealous and happy at the same time.

My wife, just a child then of five or ten or eighteen years old,
heard the slurred laughter of her father, the drunk, and
maybe he would laugh and get off the phone and be charming
or maybe he would be the cruel bastard, but there was no way
of knowing until he got off the phone, so she'd sit in her room
with a glass of water on the windowsill, oh, she'd be praying
to that glass of water, oh, she'd be praying
like everything was two parts broken heart and one part hope.

 

Why Indian Men Fall in Love With White Women

"This is how it is," says the white woman in the donut shop (it wasn't
a donut shop but something else entirely) and then she laughs
a melodious, joyous noise, and she smacks a hand, her left one
I believe, to her forehead in mock-Lucy exasperation, and then says
again, "This is how it is," but then adds as an afterthought, or

considering the use of the pun, perhaps had planned on saying it
all along, saying, "This is my job," except she doesn't say job, as
in work, she says Job, with a long vowel, as in the guy from the Bible.
Of course, this makes me love her, because if she said it
as an afterthought, then she is bright, but if she had always planned

to say it, to say Job, like the Job in the Bible, who had the worst job
in human history, then she is disciplined. She sais "This is my Job,"
as an afterthought, or as part of her daily script, I don't care which.
She says Job with the job, the job belonging to Job, Job possessed
by his job, the Job, the job, the Job, the job. Is the white woman

in the donut shop really that clever, and let's admit it, the pun
is not truly that clever, but clever enough, perhaps too clever
for a woman working in a donut shop (but it wasn't really
a donut shop), but I don't really care to guess at the exact level
of her education, because she laughs so joyously, because her eyes

are blue and alive with happiness and intelligence, so I decide
right there in the donut shop, that she is indeed too clever to be
working in a donut shop, that she is, in fact, a scholar who turned
her back on her academic pursuits, that she was a theologian
a blessed and gifted woman who wanted to be a priest, a Jesuit

an Ignation, of all things, but was turned back by the Catholic Church
and its antiquated notions of gender. She is romantic and novel
and more than a little sad, but she disguises her sadness so well
behind her blue eyes, though I am sensitive enough to see enough
of her sadness to guess at the whole of her sadness, even as she laughs

even as she takes my sympathetic order for a dozen donuts, as she gathers
the donuts into the appropriate container, as she hands it to me, as
our hands touch, as the tips of her fingers brush against the tips
of my fingers, as we briefly share a moment, and by "moment," I mean
a segment of immeasurable time, and in that moment, I feel forgiven

or perhaps I am merely aroused sexually and/or spiritually, but
in either case, I take a donut (maple?) from my appropriate container
and offer it to her, and she takes it with delight (she still loves
donuts, despite the Job-ness of her job), and she bites into it
and chews it without suggestion. She chews simply

with and without grace. She chews like a monk. She is that flour;
she is that egg; she is that sugar; she is that water. She is that flour;
she is that egg; she is that sugar; she is that water; She is the whole
of the donut; she is the hole of the donuts. She is the blue tear
balanced on the lower lid of her left eye. She is Job, my dear Job.

 

Owl Dancing with Fred Astaire

During a traditional Native American owl dance, the woman asks the man to dance. He is not supposed to refuse. However, if he does refuse, he must pay the woman whatever she wants and then tell the entire crowd at the powwow exactly why he refused.

 

I. 

I met the Indian woman who asked Fred Astaire to dance.
He politely refused her offer. “He was so charming,” she said, “even when he rejected me.
But I kept wishing it was an owl dance.”

II.

An owl dance is simple: two steps with your left foot forward,
one step with your right foot back, all to the beat of a drum currently being pounded by six Indian men in baseball hats.
They sing falsetto. Many non-Indians wonder what they are singing but that is too complicated to explain here. Let’s just say
they are singing an owl dance song. It is not necessarily romantic. I mean, sisters owl dance with brothers
and sons owl dance with their mothers. Yet, at every powwow, there are beautiful Indian women
who owl dance with beautiful Indian men, all hoping for love/sex/a brief vacation from loneliness.
I must emphasize, however, that our love lives are not simple.There are Indian men who have never been asked to owl dance.
Alone in the powwow crowd, those men tap their feet lightly along with the drums. They sing softly under their breath.
Perhaps they secretly wish they were Fred Astaire.

III.

Fred Astaire is gone now.
He is dead.
He will not be coming back.
However, if you watch his movies
you will notice
that he often smiles. What was he thinking?
Was he merely pleased with himself
for being Fred Astaire or was he completely unaware
of the camera and crew?
Was he dancing simply for the love of dancing? I don’t know
and you will never know either.
Only Fred Astaire knew and he was very good at keeping a secret
or so I am told
by the people who helped keep his secrets.

IV.

In my dream, Fred Astaire stumbles (yes, stumbles)
into the powwow and is shocked by the number of Indians who have survived
the smallpox blankets, U.S. Cavalry, relocation, etc. He smiles because, well, he is a good man prone to smiling.
(I must emphasize, however, that there are also bad men who are prone to smiling.) Fred Astaire loves the drums.
He is pleasantly surprised by the quality of the singing. Such pitch! and timbre! and range! and projection!
Fred Astaire taps his foot. He is wearing a tuxedo. He is the skinniest white man in the history of the world.
Can you see him? He is not all that handsome but he looks like a dancer. A great dancer.
In all cultures, women will choose a homely great dancer over a handsome non-dancer. Fred Astaire is confident.
He waits for the next owl dance to begin.

V.

Ask yourself this: How many times in your life
are you going to be asked to dance? Take that number and divide it by the number of men and/or women
who have expressed deep affection for you. If that number is X, then Y = heartbreak + X.
And, or course, Y is always equal to Fred Astaire.

 

At Navajo Monument Valley Tribal School

from the photograph
by Skeet McAuley 
the football field rises 
to meet the mesa. Indian boys 
gallop across the grass, against

the beginnings of their body. 
On those Saturday afternoons, 
unbroken horses gather to watch

their sons growing larger 
in the small parts of the world.
Everyone is the quarterback.

There is no thin man in a big hat 
writing down all the names 
in two columns: winners and losers.

This is the eternal football game, 
Indians versus Indians. All the Skins 
in the wooden bleachers fancydancing,

stomping red dust straight down 
into nothing. Before the game is over, 
the eighth-grade girls' track team

comes running, circling the field, 
their thin and brown legs echoing 
wild horses, wild horses, wild horses.

 

The Farm

1. Jonah
All of us, the Indians, know exactly where we were
when scientists announced that they had found the cure

for cancer. I was eating lunch in the Tribal Cafe
for the third time that week and was only halfway

through my fry bread when the national news broke
into the local news: a white man in a lab coat

stood at a podium porcupined with microphones
and quietly spoke. "We have found that the bone

marrow of Indians, synthesized with a few trace
elements, form a powerful antiviral agent named

Steptoe 123. This agent, when taken orally, will
stop the metastatic growth of tumors and kill

cancer cells. Steptoe 123 has been 95% effective
in ten years of research under the direction

of Dr. Miles Steptoe at the Center for Disease
Control. We have prepared a detailed press release

which will give you more information on Steptoe
123, Dr. Steptoe, and all that you need to know

at this time. The President, with a clear vision
of the future of Steptoe 123, has made a decision.

Therefore, under the authority of Executive Order
1492, we have closed all of the reservation borders

within the United States and will keep them closed
to any and all unauthorized traffic until further notice."

Silence. Then I turned to Charlie the Cook, who was really
the dishwater. "Jonah," he asked me. "Is it real?"

"It's real," I said. Charlie looked at me, looked|
at Agnes the Waitress, who was really the cook.

"Why is it real?" asked Charlie, but it was too late
for a history lesson. We all needed to escape

before the borders were completely shut down.
"We've got to go," I said. "We've got to go now."

So Agnes, Charlie, and I jumped into my old car
and prayed it would save us like that famous ark

but we didn't even make it past
Cold Springs before we heard the first dissonant

music: the helicopters played ragtime as they fell
from Heaven, as one descended on us with propeller
I drove the car off the road and into a field

where everything stopped
as Sam the Indian, who

was really white, suddenly stepped onto the road
with his hands out, palms open, just inches below

that helicopter, as Charlie asked, "Where did he
come from?" I just remember Sam was whittled

to bone as he helicopter dropped down onto him.
(Did you know you can play a gospel hymn

on a flute carved from human bone? I heard
the hymn once, in a dream, but have since learned

to play it on a hollow femur.) The soldiers came
for us then, dragged us from the car, asked for our names

and tribal affiliations, demanded to know if the guy
killed under the helicopter was Indian or white.

"He was white," I said. "Fully white?" a soldier asked
and I told him that Sam the Indian might be the last

fully good white man in America. "The dead guy ain't Feeder
or Breeder," shouted the soldier. Sam wasn't needed

because the scientists couldn't use his bone marrow
so the soldiers left Sam's body to the crows and sparrows.

"What am I?" I asked the soldier as he tied my hands behind
my back with soft cotton twine, but he did not reply.

"What am I?" I asked the soldier as they carried
me to the helicopter. "Are you single or married?"

asked a soldier. "I'm a bag of bones," I said.
"Do you have any children," the soldier asked again

and again, but I kept telling him I was all alone
in this new world, that I was just a bag of bones.

3. Charlie the Cook
After we were captured by the soldiers, they took all of the Indians to a place called the Farm. My history became their history. They took notes. They tattooed my forehead with a B for Breeder, because I was young and pure-blood. They keep the Breeder men and women together. In each cell, there are five women and one man. We are rotated often, never allowed to develop relationships. We are not allowed to talk. We are never in the same cell with a member of the same tribe. Bright lights wake us at 6 A.M. We eat breakfast only after we procreate. I'm supposed to have sex with five Indian women a day. I have fathered dozens of children since this all started. Half of my children became Breeders and stayed at the Farm, while the other half became Feeders and were sent to the Kitchen. The Feeders have it much worse than the Breeders. The Feeders have their marrow taken from them. They are hooked up to machines that suck it out. Sometimes they survive. Sometimes they die. It happens to children, too. There is no age limit. When they need the marrow, they take it. There's constant demand. Each cancer patient needs a year's worth of Steptoe 123. Late at night, in the cell, I reach my hand out into the dark and I feel another hand reaching out for mine. I cannot see who I touch. We cannot speak. But we hold each other's hands lightly, ready to release our grips at any moment.



4. Agnes the Waitress
When the Indian men come to me
I try to smile.

I lift my tunic
and part my legs

with as much honor
as I can manage.

I try to love the Indian men
who are forced to enter me.

It would be easy to hate them.
Some women do.

Some women refuse
to acknowledge the man's body.

Some women close their eyes 
and imagine a new childhood.

Some women weep constantly.
They don't last long.

But I hold the men close
and kiss their necks.

That always surprises them.
They stare at me

and I wonder if 
I am beautiful.

I have forgotten
what that means.

I cannot tell the difference
between a beautiful man

and an ugly man
because it makes no difference.

We do not have the luxury
of such a decision.

We are Indian
and that is all that matters

though it is rumored
that white guards sneak

into bed with Indian women.
I have heard the rustling

of blankets late at night
when Indian women crawled

into bed with Indian women.
An Indian woman once kissed me

and I felt her hands on my breasts.
I reached for her, too

but the guard rushed in
and took her away.

I never saw her again.
I dream about her

though I cannot tell you
if she was beautiful.

I want to believe
my babies are beautiful

though I have learned to let them go.
I give birth.

I heal.
I am pregnant again.

Pregnancy is the good time.
Pregnant women share a cell.

We eat well.
We are not touched.

We are allowed to speak
to the body inside our own

and pretend it is our mother,
father, sister, and brother.



5. Charlie the Cook
We have developed a highly complex and subtle sign language. Through slight gestures, such as brushing the hair from our faces, we can talk about the past. The volume of a cough can change the tense of a sentence. A woman can sit up in bed, scratch her cheek, stand quickly, shuffle across the room to a water fountain, take a big drink, swallow loudly, and we'd all know she was telling a joke. Indians always find a way to laugh, though each of us laugh in a different way. I laugh by crossing my arms. I cry by tapping my left foot against the floor.



6. Agnes the Waitress
I try to find the soldiers beneath their masks.
I try to find the doctors behind their sorrow.

The white people never thought to ask
if we would voluntarily donate the marrow.



7. Jonah
We've been planning the revolution for years.
We have weapons and white friends, but I fear

Indians have forgotten how to survive.
It's a complicated song and dance. Late at night

we practice. We pound invisible drums. We sing
with our mouths closed. Silence is the thing

we must learn to fear. This is the plan.
One night, we will slip from our beds and stand

together. We will stamp our feet in unison
and sing the same song loudly with strong lungs

and hearts. We will sing the old songs.
Cousins, this is not where we belong.

Way, ya, hi, yo. Way, ya, hi, yo.< 
Way, ya, hi, yo. Way, ya, hi, yo.

Cousins, remember how we sang and danced back then.
During the revolution, we will find our music again.

9. Charlie the Cook
I have not seen a black man in years. Not a black woman. Not a Mexican man, though their blood is often mixed with Indians, too. I have not seen another Indian man. I have seen only white men and Indian women. There are rumors. The Indian women have refused to procreate, and instead, they are killing the Indian men. It would be easy. In each cell, five women to each man. There are rumors. Indian men are becoming sterile. We have fathered too many children. There are rumors. The revolution is about to begin. Indians will rise against our jailers. We will never touch each other again. We will allow ourselves to die as a people, rather than live as we do now. There are rumors. A large army of sympathetic outsiders, white, black, brown, and yellow, are preparing to storm the Farm. They will free us. There are rumors. All of the cancer is gone. It has been completely destroyed. Our jailers will soon open the doors and let us free. They will give us medals of honor as we leave.

 

 

Defending Walt Whitman

Basketball is like this for young Indian boys, all arms and legs
and serious stomach muscles. Every body is brown!
These are the twentieth-century warriors who will never kill,
although a few sat quietly in the deserts of Kuwait,
waiting for orders to do something, to do something.

God, there is nothing as beautiful as a jumpshot
on a reservation summer basketball court
where the ball is moist with sweat,
and makes a sound when it swishes through the net
that causes Walt Whitman to weep because it is so perfect.

There are veterans of foreign wars here
although their bodies are still dominated
by collarbones and knees, although their bodies still respond
in the ways that bodies are supposed to respond when we are young.
Every body is brown! Look there, that boy can run
up and down this court forever. He can leap for a rebound
with his back arched like a salmon, all meat and bone
synchronized, magnetic, as if the court were a river,
as if the rim were a dam, as if the air were a ladder
leading the Indian boy toward home.

Some of the Indian boys still wear their military hair cuts
while a few have let their hair grow back.
It will never be the same as it was before!
One Indian boy has never cut his hair, not once, and he braids it
into wild patterns that do not measure anything.
He is just a boy with too much time on his hands.
Look at him. He wants to play this game in bare feet.

God, the sun is so bright! There is no place like this.
Walt Whitman stretches his calf muscles
on the sidelines. He has the next game.
His huge beard is ridiculous on the reservation.
Some body throws a crazy pass and Walt Whitman catches it
with quick hands. He brings the ball close to his nose
and breathes in all of its smells: leather, brown skin, sweat,
black hair, burning oil, twisted ankle, long drink of warm water,
gunpowder, pine tree. Walt Whitman squeezes the ball tightly.
He wants to run. He hardly has the patience to wait for his turn.
"What's the score?" he asks. He asks, "What's the score?"

Basketball is like this for Walt Whitman. He watches these Indian boys
as if they were the last bodies on earth. Every body is brown!
Walt Whitman shakes because he believes in God.
Walt Whitman dreams of the Indian boy who will defend him,
trapping him in the corner, all flailing arms and legs
and legendary stomach muscles. Walt Whitman shakes
because he believes in God. Walt Whitman dreams
of the first jumpshot he will take, the ball arcing clumsily
from his fingers, striking the rim so hard that it sparks.
Walt Whitman shakes because he believes in God.
Walt Whitman closes his eyes. He is a small man and his beard
is ludicrous on the reservation, absolutely insane.
His beard makes the Indian boys righteously laugh. His beard
frightens the smallest Indian boys. His beard tickles the skin
of the Indian boys who dribble past him. His beard, his beard!

God, there is beauty in every body. Walt Whitman stands
at center court while the Indian boys run from basket to basket.
Walt Whitman cannot tell the difference between
offense and defense. He does not care if he touches the ball.
Half of the Indian boys wear t-shirts damp with sweat
and the other half are bareback, skin slick and shiny.
There is no place like this. Walt Whitman smiles.
Walt Whitman shakes. This game belongs to him.

 

 
The Powwow at the End of the World


I am told by many of you that I must forgive and so I shall
after an Indian woman puts her shoulder to the Grand Coulee Dam
and topples it. I am told by many of you that I must forgive
and so I shall after the floodwaters burst each successive dam
downriver from the Grand Coulee. I am told by many of you
that I must forgive and so I shall after the floodwaters find
their way to the mouth of the Columbia River as it enters the Pacific
and causes all of it to rise. I am told by many of you that I must forgive
and so I shall after the first drop of floodwater is swallowed by that salmon
waiting in the Pacific. I am told by many of you that I must forgive and so I shall
after that salmon swims upstream, through the mouth of the Columbia
and then past the flooded cities, broken dams and abandoned reactors
of Hanford. I am told by many of you that I must forgive and so I shall
after that salmon swims through the mouth of the Spokane River
as it meets the Columbia, then upstream, until it arrives
in the shallows of a secret bay on the reservation where I wait alone.
I am told by many of you that I must forgive and so I shall after
that salmon leaps into the night air above the water, throws
a lightning bolt at the brush near my feet, and starts the fire
which will lead all of the lost Indians home. I am told
by many of you that I must forgive and so I shall
after we Indians have gathered around the fire with that salmon
who has three stories it must tell before sunrise: one story will teach us
how to pray; another story will make us laugh for hours;
the third story will give us reason to dance. I am told by many
of you that I must forgive and so I shall when I am dancing
with my tribe during the powwow at the end of the world.

Superman and Me 

I learned to read with a Superman comic book. Simple enough, I suppose. I cannot recall which particular Superman comic book I read, nor can I remember which villain he fought in that issue. I cannot remember the plot, nor the means by which I obtained the comic book. What I can remember is this: I was 3 years old, a Spokane Indian boy living with his family on the Spokane Indian Reservation in eastern Washington state. We were poor by most standards, but one of my parents usually managed to find some minimum-wage job or another, which made us middle-class by reservation standards. I had a brother and three sisters. We lived on a combination of irregular paychecks, hope, fear and government surplus food.

My father, who is one of the few Indians who went to Catholic school on purpose, was an avid reader of westerns, spy thrillers, murder mysteries, gangster epics, basketball player biographies and anything else he could find. He bought his books by the pound at Dutch's Pawn Shop, Goodwill, Salvation Army and Value Village. When he had extra money, he bought new novels at supermarkets, convenience stores and hospital gift shops. Our house was filled with books. They were stacked in crazy piles in the bathroom, bedrooms and living room. In a fit of unemployment-inspired creative energy, my father built a set of bookshelves and soon filled them with a random assortment of books about the Kennedy assassination, Watergate, the Vietnam War and the entire 23-book series of the Apache westerns. My father loved books, and since I loved my father with an aching devotion, I decided to love books as well.

I can remember picking up my father's books before I could read. The words themselves were mostly foreign, but I still remember the exact moment when I first understood, with a sudden clarity, the purpose of a paragraph. I didn't have the vocabulary to say "paragraph," but I realized that a paragraph was a fence that held words. The words inside a paragraph worked together for a common purpose. They had some specific reason for being inside the same fence. This knowledge delighted me. I began to think of everything in terms of paragraphs. Our reservation was a small paragraph within the United States. My family's house was a paragraph, distinct from the other paragraphs of the LeBrets to the north, the Fords to our south and the Tribal School to the west. Inside our house, each family member existed as a separate paragraph but still had genetics and common experiences to link us. Now, using this logic, I can see my changed family as an essay of seven paragraphs: mother, father, older brother, the deceased sister, my younger twin sisters and our adopted little brother.

At the same time I was seeing the world in paragraphs, I also picked up that Superman comic book. Each panel, complete with picture, dialogue and narrative was a three-dimensional paragraph. In one panel, Superman breaks through a door. His suit is red, blue and yellow. The brown door shatters into many pieces. I look at the narrative above the picture. I cannot read the words, but I assume it tells me that "Superman is breaking down the door." Aloud, I pretend to read the words and say, "Superman is breaking down the door." Words, dialogue, also float out of Superman's mouth. Because he is breaking down the door, I assume he says, "I am breaking down the door." Once again, I pretend to read the words and say aloud, "I am breaking down the door" In this way, I learned to read.

This might be an interesting story all by itself. A little Indian boy teaches himself to read at an early age and advances quickly. He reads "Grapes of Wrath" in kindergarten when other children are struggling through "Dick and Jane." If he'd been anything but an Indian boy living on the reservation, he might have been called a prodigy. But he is an Indian boy living on the reservation and is simply an oddity. He grows into a man who often speaks of his childhood in the third-person, as if it will somehow dull the pain and make him sound more modest about his talents.


A smart Indian is a dangerous person, widely feared and ridiculed by Indians and non-Indians alike. I fought with my classmates on a daily basis. They wanted me to stay quiet when the non-Indian teacher asked for answers, for volunteers, for help. We were Indian children who were expected to be stupid. Most lived up to those expectations inside the classroom but subverted them on the outside. They struggled with basic reading in school but could remember how to sing a few dozen powwow songs. They were monosyllabic in front of their non-Indian teachers but could tell complicated stories and jokes at the dinner table. They submissively ducked their heads when confronted by a non-Indian adult but would slug it out with the Indian bully who was 10 years older. As Indian children, we were expected to fail in the non-Indian world. Those who failed were ceremonially accepted by other Indians and appropriately pitied by non-Indians.

I refused to fail. I was smart. I was arrogant. I was lucky. I read books late into the night, until I could barely keep my eyes open. I read books at recess, then during lunch, and in the few minutes left after I had finished my classroom assignments. I read books in the car when my family traveled to powwows or basketball games. In shopping malls, I ran to the bookstores and read bits and pieces of as many books as I could. I read the books my father brought home from the pawnshops and secondhand. I read the books I borrowed from the library. I read the backs of cereal boxes. I read the newspaper. I read the bulletins posted on the walls of the school, the clinic, the tribal offices, the post office. I read junk mail. I read auto-repair manuals. I read magazines. I read anything that had words and paragraphs. I read with equal parts joy and desperation. I loved those books, but I also knew that love had only one purpose. I was trying to save my life.

Despite all the books I read, I am still surprised I became a writer. I was going to be a pediatrician. These days, I write novels, short stories, and poems. I visit schools and teach creative writing to Indian kids. In all my years in the reservation school system, I was never taught how to write poetry, short stories or novels. I was certainly never taught that Indians wrote poetry, short stories and novels. Writing was something beyond Indians. I cannot recall a single time that a guest teacher visited the reservation. There must have been visiting teachers. Who were they? Where are they now? Do they exist? I visit the schools as often as possible. The Indian kids crowd the classroom. Many are writing their own poems, short stories and novels. They have read my books. They have read many other books. They look at me with bright eyes and arrogant wonder. They are trying to save their lives. Then there are the sullen and already defeated Indian kids who sit in the back rows and ignore me with theatrical precision. The pages of their notebooks are empty. They carry neither pencil nor pen. They stare out the window. They refuse and resist. "Books," I say to them. "Books," I say. I throw my weight against their locked doors. The door holds. I am smart. I am arrogant. I am lucky. I am trying to save our lives.
 

 

I Hated Tonto (Still Do) 

I was a little Spokane Indian boy who read every book and saw every movie about Indians, no matter how terrible. I'd read those historical romance novels about the stereotypical Indian warrior ravaging the virginal white schoolteacher.

I can still see the cover art.

The handsome, blue-eyed warrior (the Indians in romance novels are always blue-eyed because half-breeds are somehow sexier than full-blooded Indians) would be nuzzling (the Indians in romance novels are always performing acts that are described in animalistic terms) the impossibly pale neck of a white woman as she reared her head back in primitive ecstasy (the Indians in romance novels always inspire white women to commit acts of primitive ecstasy).

Of course, after reading such novels, I imagined myself to be a blue-eyed warrior nuzzling the necks of various random, primitive and ecstatic white women.

And I just as often imagined myself to be a cinematic Indian, splattered with Day-Glo Hollywood war paint as I rode off into yet another battle against the latest actor to portray Gen. George Armstrong Custer.

But I never, not once, imagined myself to be Tonto.

I hated Tonto then and I hate him now.

However, despite my hatred of Tonto, I loved movies about Indians, loved them beyond all reasoning and saw no fault with any of them.

I loved John Ford's "The Searchers."

I rooted for John Wayne as he searched for his niece for years and years. I rooted for John Wayne even though I knew he was going to kill his niece because she had been "soiled" by the Indians. Hell, I rooted for John Wayne because I understood why he wanted to kill his niece.

I hated those savage Indians just as much as John Wayne did.



In the movies, Indians are always accompanied by ominous music. And I've seen so many Indian movies that I feel like I'm constantly accompanied by ominous music. I always feel that something bad is about to happen.

I am always aware of how my whole life is shaped by my hatred of Tonto. Whenever I think of Tonto, I hear ominous music.

I walk into shopping malls or family restaurants, as the ominous music drops a few octaves, and imagine that I am Billy Jack, the half-breed Indian and Vietnam vet turned flower-power pacifist (now there's a combination) who loses his temper now and again, takes off his shoes (while his opponents patiently wait for him to do so), and then kicks the red out of the necks of a few dozen racist white extras.

You have to remember Billy Jack, right?

Every Indian remembers Billy Jack. I mean, back in the day, Indians worshipped Billy Jack.

Whenever a new Billy Jack movie opened in Spokane, my entire tribe would climb into two or three vans like so many circus clowns and drive to the East Trent Drive-In for a long evening of greasy popcorn, flat soda pop, fossilized licorice rope and interracial violence.

We Indians cheered as Billy Jack fought for us, for every single Indian.

Of course, we conveniently ignored the fact that Tom Laughlin, the actor who played Billy Jack, was definitely not Indian.

After all, such luminary white actors as Charles Bronson, Chuck Connors, Burt Reynolds, Burt Lancaster, Sal Mineo, Anthony Quinn and Charlton Heston had already portrayed Indians, so who were we to argue?

I mean, Tom Laughlin did have a nice tan and he spoke in monosyllables and wore cowboy boots and a jean jacket just like Indians. And he did have a Cherokee grandmother or grandfather or butcher, so he was Indian by proximity, and that was good enough in 1972, when disco music was about to rear its ugly head and bell-bottom pants were just beginning to change the shape of our legs.

When it came to the movies, Indians had learned to be happy with less.

We didn't mind that cinematic Indians never had jobs.

We didn't mind that cinematic Indians were deadly serious.

We didn't mind that cinematic Indians were rarely played by Indian actors.

We made up excuses.

"Well, that Tom Laughlin may not be Indian, but he sure should be."

"Well, that movie wasn't so good, but Sal Mineo looked sort of like Uncle Stubby when he was still living out on the reservation."

"Well, I hear Burt Reynolds is a little bit Cherokee. Look at his cheekbones. He's got them Indian cheekbones."

"Well, it's better than nothing."

Yes, that became our battle cry.

"Sometimes, it's a good day to die. Sometimes, it's better than nothing."

We Indians became so numb to the possibility of dissent, so accepting of our own lowered expectations, that we canonized a film like "Powwow Highway."

When it was first released, I loved "Powwow Highway." I cried when I first saw it in the theater, then cried again when I stayed and watched it again a second time.

I mean, I loved that movie. I memorized whole passages of dialogue. But recently, I watched the film for the first time in many years and cringed in shame and embarrassment with every stereotypical scene.

I cringed when Philbert Bono climbed to the top of a sacred mountain and left a Hershey chocolate bar as an offering.

I cringed when Philbert and Buddy Red Bow waded into a stream and sang Indian songs to the moon.

I cringed when Buddy had a vision of himself as an Indian warrior throwing a tomahawk through the window of a police cruiser.

I mean, I don't know a single Indian who would leave a chocolate bar as an offering. I don't know any Indians who have ever climbed to the top of any mountain. I don't know any Indians who wade into streams and sing to the moon. I don't know of any Indians who imagine themselves to be Indian warriors.
Wait—

I was wrong. I know of at least one Indian boy who always imagined himself to be a cinematic Indian warrior.

Me.

I watched the movies and saw the kind of Indian I was supposed to be.

A cinematic Indian is supposed to climb mountains.

I am afraid of heights.

A cinematic Indian is supposed to wade into streams and sing songs.

I don't know how to swim.

A cinematic Indian is supposed to be a warrior.

I haven't been in a fistfight since sixth grade and she beat the crap out of me.

I mean, I knew I could never be as brave, as strong, as wiser as visionary, as white as the Indians in the movies.

I was just one little Indian boy who hated Tonto because Tonto was the only cinematic Indian who looked like me.




 

Ellen West 

I love sweets,—
                              heaven
would be dying on a bed of vanilla ice cream . . .
 
But my true self
is thin, all profile
 
and effortless gestures, the sort of blond
elegant girl whose
                                body is the image of her soul.
 
—My doctors tell me I must give up
this ideal;
                 but I
WILL NOT . . . cannot.
 
Only to my husband I'm not simply a "case."
 
But he is a fool. He married
meat, and thought it was a wife.
 
* * *
 
Why am I a girl?
 
I ask my doctors, and they tell me they
don't know, that it is just "given."
 
But it has such
implications—;
                            and sometimes,
I even feel like a girl.
 
* * *
 
Now, at the beginning of Ellen's thirty-second year, her
physical condition has deteriorated still further. Her use
of laxatives increases beyond measure. Every evening she
takes sixty to seventy tablets of a laxative, with the result
that she suffers tortured vomiting at night and violent
diarrhea by day, often accompanied by a weakness of the
heart. She has thinned down to a skeleton, and weighs
only 92 pounds.

About five years ago, I was in a restaurant,
eating alone
                           with a book. I was
not married, and often did that . . .
 
—I'd turn down
dinner invitations, so I could eat alone;
 
I'd allow myself two pieces of bread, with
butter, at the beginning, and three scoops of
vanilla ice cream, at the end,—
 
                                                     sitting there alone
 
with a book, both in the book
and out of it, waited on, idly
watching people,—
 
                                    when an attractive young man
and woman, both elegantly dressed,
sat next to me.
 
                            She was beautiful—;
 
with sharp, clear features, a good
bone structure—;
                               if she took her make-up off
in front of you, rubbing cold cream
again and again across her skin, she still would be
beautiful—
                   more beautiful.
 
And he,—
                   I couldn't remember when I had seen a man
so attractive. I didn't know why. He was almost
 
a male version
                             of her,—
 
I had the sudden, mad notion that I
wanted to be his lover . . .
 
—Were they married?
                                      were they lovers?
 
They didn't wear wedding rings.
 
Their behavior was circumspect. They discussed
politics. They didn't touch . . .
 
—How could I discover?
 
                                                Then, when the first course
arrived, I noticed the way
 
each held his fork out for the other
 
to taste what he had ordered . . .
 
                                                                 They did this
again and again, with pleased looks, indulgent
smiles, for each course,
                                     more than once for each dish—;
much too much for just friends . . .
 
—Their behavior somehow sickened me;
 
the way each gladly
put the food the other had offered into his mouth—;
 
I knew what they were. I knew they slept together.
 
An immense depression came over me . . .
 
—I knew I could never
with such ease allow another to put food into my mouth:
 
happily myself put food into another's mouth—;
 
I knew that to become a wife I would have to give up my ideal.
 
* * *
 
Even as a child,
I saw that the "natural" process of aging
 
is for one's middle to thicken—
one's skin to blotch;
 
as happened to my mother.
And her mother.
                            I loathed "Nature."
 
At twelve, pancakes
became the most terrible thought there is. . .
 
I shall defeat "Nature."
 
In the hospital, when they
weigh me, I wear weights secretly sewn into my belt.

January 16. The patient is allowed to eat in her room, but comes
readily with her husband to afternoon coffee. Previously she had
stoutly resisted this on the ground that she did not really eat but
devoured like a wild animal. This she demonstrated with utmost
realism . . . . Her physical examination showed nothing striking.
Salivary-glands are markedly enlarged on both sides.
January 21. Has been reading Faust again. In her diary,
writes that art is the "mutual permeation" of the "world of the
body" and the "world of the spirit." Says that her own poems
are "hospital poems . . . weak—without skill or perseverance;
only managing to beat their wings softly."
February 8. Agitation, quickly subsided again. Has
attached herself to an elegant, very thin female patient. Homo-
erotic component strikingly evident.
February 15. Vexation, and torment. Says that her mind
forces her always to think of eating. Feels herself degraded by
this. Has entirely, for the first time in years, stopped writing poetry.

Callas is my favorite singer, but I've only
seen her once—;
 
I've never forgotten that night. . .
 
—It was in Tosca, she had long before
lost weight, her voice
had been, for years,
                                  deteriorating, half itself. . .
 
When her career began, of course, she was fat,
 
enormous—; in the early photographs,
sometimes I almost don't recognize her. . .
 
The voice too then was enormous—
 
healthy; robust; subtle; but capable of
crude effects, even vulgar,
                                             almost out of
high spirits, too much health. . .
 
But soon she felt that she must lose weight,—
that all she was trying to express
 
was obliterated by her body,
buried in flesh—;
                               abruptly, within
four months, she lost at least sixty pounds. . .
 
—The gossip in Milan was that Callas
had swallowed a tapeworm.
 
But of course she hadn't.
 
                                            The tapeworm
was her soul. . .
 
—How her soul, uncompromising,
insatiable,
                    must have loved eating the flesh from her bones,
 
revealing this extraordinarily
mercurial; fragile; masterly creature. . .
 
—But irresistibly, nothing
stopped there; the huge voice
 
also began to change: at first, it simply diminished
in volume, in size,
                                  then the top notes became
shrill, unreliable—at last,
usually not there at all. . .
 
—No one knows why. Perhaps her mind,
ravenous, still insatiable, sensed
 
that to struggle with the shreds of a voice
 
must make her artistry subtler, more refined,
more capable of expressing humiliation,
rage, betrayal. . .
 
—Perhaps the opposite. Perhaps her spirit
loathed the unending struggle
 
to embody itself, to manifest itself, on a stage whose
 
mechanics, and suffocating customs,
seemed expressly designed to annihilate spirit. . .
 
—I know that in Tosca, in the second act,
when, humiliated, hounded by Scarpia,
she sang Vissi d'arte
                                      —"I lived for art"—
 
and in torment, bewilderment, at the end she asks,
with a voice reaching
                                      harrowingly for the notes,
 
"Art has repaid me LIKE THIS?"
 
                                                           I felt I was watching
autobiography—
                              an art; skill;
virtuosity
 
miles distant from the usual soprano's
athleticism,—
                         the usual musician's dream
of virtuosity without content. . .
 
—I wonder what she feels, now,
listening to her recordings.
 
For they have already, within a few years,
begun to date. . .
 
Whatever they express
they express through the style of a decade
and a half—;
                         a style she helped create. . .
 
—She must know that now
she probably would not do a trill in
exactly that way,—
                                   that the whole sound, atmosphere,
dramaturgy of her recordings
 
have just slightly become those of the past. . .
 
—Is it bitter? Does her soul
tell her
 
that she was an idiot ever to think
anything
                material wholly could satisfy?. . .
 
—Perhaps it says: The only way
to escape
the History of Styles
 
is not to have a body.
 
* * *
 
When I open my eyes in the morning, my great
mystery
             stands before me . . .
 
—I know that I am intelligent; therefore
 
the inability not to fear food
day-and-night; this unending hunger
ten minutes after I have eaten . . .
                                                          a childish
dread of eating; hunger which can have no cause,—
 
half my mind says that all this
is demeaning . . .
 
                                 Bread
 
for days on end
drives all real thought from my brain . . .
 
—Then I think, No. The ideal of being thin
 
conceals the ideal
not to have a body—;
                                     which is NOT trivial . . .
 
This wish seems now as much a "given" of my existence
 
as the intolerable
fact that I am dark-complexioned; big-boned;
and once weighed
one hundred and sixty-five pounds . . .
 
—But then I think, No. That's too simple,—
 
without a body, who can
know himself at all?
                                   Only by
acting; choosing; rejecting; have I
made myself—
                         discovered who and what Ellen can be . . .
 
—But then again I think, NO. This I is anterior
 
to name; gender; action;
fashion;
                MATTER ITSELF,—
 
. . . trying to stop my hunger with FOOD
is like trying to appease thirst
                                                   with ink.

March 30. Result of the consultation: Both gentlemen agree
completely with my prognosis and doubt any therapeutic
usefulness of commitment even more emphatically than I.
All three of us are agreed that it is not a case of obsessional
neurosis and not one of manic-depressive psychosis, and that
no definitely reliable therapy is possible. We therefore resolved
to give in to the patient's demand for discharge.

The train-ride yesterday
was far worse than I expected . . .
 
                                                         In our compartment
 
were ordinary people: a student;
a woman; her child;—
 
they had ordinary bodies, pleasant faces;
                                                                            but I thought
 
I was surrounded by creatures
 
with the pathetic, desperate
desire to be not what they were:—
 
the student was short,
and carried his body as if forcing
it to be taller—;
 
the woman showed her gums when she smiled,
and often held her
hand up to hide them—;
 
the child
seemed to cry simply because it was
small; a dwarf, and helpless . . .
 
—I was hungry. I had insisted that my husband
not bring food . . .
 
After about thirty minutes, the woman
peeled an orange
 
to quiet the child. She put a section
into its mouth—;
                               immediately it spit it out.
 
The piece fell to the floor.
 
—She pushed it with her foot through the dirt
toward me
several inches.
 
My husband saw me staring
down at the piece . . .
 
—I didn't move; how I wanted
to reach out,
                        and as if invisible
 
shove it in my mouth—;
 
my body
became rigid. As I stared at him,
I could see him staring
 
at me,—
                then he looked at the student—; at the woman—; then
back to me . . .
 
I didn't move.
 
—At last, he bent down, and
casually
               threw it out the window.
 
He looked away.
 
—I got up to leave the compartment, then
saw his face,—
 
his eyes
were red;
                and I saw
 
—I'm sure I saw—
 
disappointment.
 
* * *
 
At breakfast she eats butter and sugar, at noon she eats
so much that—for the first time in thirteen years!—she is
satisfied by her food and gets really full. At afternoon
coffee she eats chocolate creams and Easter eggs. She
takes a walk with her husband, reads poems, listens to
recordings, is in a positively festive mood, and all heavi-
ness seems to have fallen away from her. She writes
letters, the last one a letter to the fellow patient here to
whom she had become so attached. In the evening she
takes a lethal dose of poison, and on the following morn-
ing she is dead. "She looked as she had never looked in
life—calm and happy and peaceful."
 
* * *
 
Dearest.—I remember how
at eighteen,
                     on hikes with friends, when
they rested, sitting down to joke or talk,
 
I circled
around them, afraid to hike ahead alone,
 
yet afraid to rest
when I was not yet truly thin.
 
You and, yes, my husband,—
you and he
 
have by degrees drawn me within the circle;
forced me to sit down at last on the ground.
 
I am grateful.
 
But something in me refuses it.
 
—How eager I have been
to compromise, to kill this refuser,—
 
but each compromise, each attempt
to poison an ideal
which often seemed to me sterile and unreal,
 
heightens my hunger.
 
I am crippled. I disappoint you.
 
Will you greet with anger, or
happiness,
 
the news which might well reach you
before this letter?
 
Your Ellen.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Herbert White 
"When I hit her on the head, it was good,

and then I did it to her a couple of times,--
but it was funny,--afterwards,
it was as if somebody else did it ...

Everything flat, without sharpness, richness or line.

Still, I liked to drive past the woods where she lay,
tell the old lady and the kids I had to take a piss,
hop out and do it to her ...

The whole buggy of them waiting for me
made me feel good;
but still, just like I knew all along,
she didn't move.

When the body got too discomposed,
I'd just jack off, letting it fall on her ...

--It sounds crazy, but I tell you
sometimes it was beautiful--; I don't know how
to say it, but for a minute, everything was possible--;
and then,
then,--
well, like I said, she didn't move: and I saw,
under me, a little girl was just lying there in the mud:

and I knew I couldn't have done that,--
somebody else had to have done that,--
standing above her there,
in those ordinary, shitty leaves ...

--One time, I went to see Dad in a motel where he was
staying with a woman; but she was gone;
you could smell the wine in the air; and he started,
real embarrassing, to cry ...
He was still a little drunk,
and asked me to forgive him for
all he hasn't done--; but, What the shit?
Who would have wanted to stay with Mom? with bastards
not even his own kids?

I got in the truck, and started to drive
and saw a little girl--
who I picked up, hit on the head, and
screwed, and screwed, and screwed, and screwed, then

buried,
in the garden of the motel ...

--You see, ever since I was a kid I wanted
to feel things make sense: I remember

looking out the window of my room back home,--
and being almost suffocated by the asphalt;
and grass; and trees; and glass;
just there, just there, doing nothing!
not saying anything! filling me up--
but also being a wall; dead, and stopping me;
--how I wanted to see beneath it, cut

beneath it, and make it
somehow, come alive ...

The salt of the earth;
Mom once said, 'Man's spunk is the salt of the earth ...'

--That night, at that Twenty-nine Palms Motel
I had passed a million times on the road, everything

fit together; was alright;
it seemed like
everything had to be there, like I had spent years
trying, and at last finally finished drawing this
huge circle ...

--But then, suddenly I knew
somebody else did it, some bastard
had hurt a little girl--; the motel
I could see again, it had been
itself all the time, a lousy
pile of bricks, plaster, that didn't seem to
have to be there,--but was, just by chance ...

--Once, on the farm, when I was a kid,
I was screwing a goat; and the rope around his neck
when he tried to get away
pulled tight;--and just when I came,
he died ...
I came back the next day; jacked off over his body;
but it didn't do any good ...

Mom once said:
'Man's spunk is the salt of the earth, and grows kids.'

I tried so hard to come; more pain than anything else;
but didn't do any good ...

--About six months ago, I heard Dad remarried,
so I drove over to Connecticut to see him and see
if he was happy.
She was twenty-five years younger than him:
she had lots of little kids, and I don't know why,
I felt shaky ...

I stopped in front of the address; and
snuck up to the window to look in ...
--There he was, a kid
six months old on his lap, laughing
and bouncing the kid, happy in his old age
to play the papa after years of sleeping around,--
it twisted me up ...
To think that what he wouldn't give me,
he wanted to give them ...

I could have killed the bastard ...

--Naturally, I just got right back in the car,
and believe me, was determined, determined,
to head straight for home ...

but the more I drove,
I kept thinking about getting a girl,
and the more I thought I shouldn't do it,
the more I had to--

I saw her coming out of the movies,
saw she was alone, and
kept circling the blocks as she walked along them,
saying, 'You're going to leave her alone.'
'You're going to leave her alone.'

--The woods were scary!
As the seasons changed, and you saw more and more
of the skull show through, the nights became clearer,
and the buds,--erect, like nipples ...

--But then, one night,
nothing worked ...
Nothing in the sky
would blur like I wanted it to;
and I couldn't, couldn't,
get it to seem to me
that somebody else did it ...

I tried, and tried, but there was just me there,
and her, and the sharp trees
saying, "That's you standing there.
You're ...
just you."

I hope I fry.

--Hell came when I saw
MYSELF ...
and couldn't stand
what I see ..." 




The Fish
 
I caught a tremendous fish
and held him beside the boat
half out of water, with my hook
fast in a corner of his mouth.
He didn't fight.
He hadn't fought at all.
He hung a grunting weight,
battered and venerable
and homely.  Here and there
his brown skin hung in strips
like ancient wallpaper,
and its pattern of darker brown 
was like wallpaper:
shapes like full-blown roses
stained and lost through age.
He was speckled with barnacles,
fine rosettes of lime,
and infested
with tiny white sea-lice,
and underneath two or three
rags of green weed hung down.
While his gills were breathing in
the terrible oxygen
—the frightening gills,
fresh and crisp with blood,
that can cut so badly—
I thought of the coarse white flesh
packed in like feathers,
the big bones and the little bones,
the dramatic reds and blacks
of his shiny entrails,
and the pink swim-bladder
like a big peony.
I looked into his eyes
which were far larger than mine
but shallower, and yellowed,
the irises backed and packed 
with tarnished tinfoil
seen through the lenses
of old scratched isinglass.
They shifted a little, but not
to return my stare.
—It was more like the tipping 
of an object toward the light.
I admired his sullen face,
the mechanism of his jaw,
and then I saw
that from his lower lip
—if you could call it a lip 
grim, wet, and weaponlike,
hung five old pieces of fish-line,
or four and a wire leader
with the swivel still attached,
with all their five big hooks
grown firmly in his mouth.
A green line, frayed at the end
where he broke it, two heavier lines, 
and a fine black thread
still crimped from the strain and snap 
when it broke and he got away.
Like medals with their ribbons 
frayed and wavering,
a five-haired beard of wisdom
trailing from his aching jaw.
I stared and stared
and victory filled up
the little rented boat,
from the pool of bilge
where oil had spread a rainbow
around the rusted engine
to the bailer rusted orange,
the sun-cracked thwarts,
the oarlocks on their strings, 
the gunnels—until everything
was rainbow, rainbow, rainbow!
And I let the fish go.
 
 
Sandpiper
 
The roaring alongside he takes for granted,
and that every so often the world is bound to shake.
He runs, he runs to the south, finical, awkward,
in a state of controlled panic, a student of Blake.
 
The beach hisses like fat. On his left, a sheet
of interrupting water comes and goes
and glazes over his dark and brittle feet.
He runs, he runs straight through it, watching his toes.
 
—Watching, rather, the spaces of sand between them
where (no detail too small) the Atlantic drains
rapidly backwards and downwards. As he runs,
he stares at the dragging grains.
 
The world is a mist. And then the world is
minute and vast and clear. The tide
is higher or lower. He couldn't tell you which.
His beak is focussed; he is preoccupied,
 
looking for something, something, something.
Poor bird, he is obsessed!
The millions of grains are black, white, tan, and gray
mixed with quartz grains, rose and amethyst. 
 
 
The Imaginary Iceberg
 
We'd rather have the iceberg than the ship, 
although it meant the end of travel. 
Although it stood stock-still like cloudy rock 
and all the sea were moving marble. 
We'd rather have the iceberg than the ship; 
we'd rather own this breathing plain of snow 
though the ship's sails were laid upon the sea 
as the snow lies undissolved upon the water. 
O solemn, floating field, 
are you aware an iceberg takes repose 
with you, and when it wakes may pasture on your snows? 
 
This is a scene a sailor'd give his eyes for. 
The ship's ignored. The iceberg rises 
and sinks again; its glassy pinnacles 
correct elliptics in the sky. 
This is a scene where he who treads the boards 
is artlessly rhetorical. The curtain 
is light enough to rise on finest ropes 
that airy twists of snow provide. 
The wits of these white peaks 
spar with the sun. Its weight the iceberg dares 
upon a shifting stage and stands and stares. 
 
The iceberg cuts its facets from within. 
Like jewelry from a grave 
it saves itself perpetually and adorns 
only itself, perhaps the snows 
which so surprise us lying on the sea. 
Good-bye, we say, good-bye, the ship steers off 
where waves give in to one another's waves 
and clouds run in a warmer sky. 
Icebergs behoove the soul 
(both being self-made from elements least visible) 
to see them so: fleshed, fair, erected indivisible. 
 
 
Giant Snail
 
The rain has stopped. The waterfall will roar like that all night. I have come out to take a walk and feed. My body—foot, that is—is wet and cold and covered with sharp gravel. It is white, the size of a dinner plate. I have set myself a goal, a certain rock, but it may well be dawn before I get there. Although I move ghostlike and my floating edges barely graze the ground, I am heavy, heavy, heavy. My white muscles are already tired. I give the impression of mysterious ease, but it is only with the greatest effort of my will that I can rise above the smallest stones and sticks. And I must not let myself be distracted by those rough spears of grass. Don't touch them. Draw back. Withdrawal is always best.
 
The rain has stopped. The waterfall makes such a noise! (And what if I fall over it?) The mountains of black rock give off such clouds of steam! Shiny streamers are hanging down their sides. When this occurs, we have a saying that the Snail Gods have come down in haste. I could never descend such steep escarpments, much less dream of climbing them.
 
That toad was too big, too, like me. His eyes beseeched my love. Our proportions horrify our neighbors.
 
Rest a minute; relax. Flattened to the ground, my body is like a pallid, decomposing leaf. What's that tapping on my shell? Nothing. Let's go on.
 
My sides move in rhythmic waves, just off the ground, from front to back, the wake of a ship, wax-white water, or a slowly melting floe. I am cold, cold, cold as ice. My blind, white bull's head was a Cretan scare-head; degenerate, my four horns that can't attack. The sides of my mouth are now my hands. They press the earth and suck it hard. Ah, but I know my shell is beautiful, and high, and glazed, and shining. I know it well, although I have not seen it. Its curled white lip is of the finest enamel. Inside, it is as smooth as silk, and I, I fill it to perfection.
 
My wide wake shines, now it is growing dark. I leave a lovely opalescent ribbon: I know this.
 
But O! I am too big. I feel it. Pity me.
 
If and when I reach the rock, I shall go into a certain crack there for the night. The waterfall below will vibrate through my shell and body all night long. In that steady pulsing I can rest. All night I shall be like a sleeping ear.
 
    
Giant Toad

I am too big. Too big by far. Pity me. 

My eyes bulge and hurt. They are my one great beauty, even so. They see too much, above, 
below. And yet, there is not much to see. The rain has stopped. The mist is gathering on 
my skin in drops. The drops run down down my sides and drip beneath my belly. Perhaps 
the droplets on my mottled hide are pretty, like dewdrops, silver on a moldering leaf? 
They chill me through and through. I feel my colors changing now, my pigments gradually 
shudder and shift over. 

Now I shall get beneath that overhanging ledge. Slowly. Hop. Two or three times more, 
silently. That was too far. I'm standing up. The lichen's gray, and rough to my front feet. 
Get down. Turn facing out, it's safer. Don't breathe until the snail gets by. But we go 
travelling the same weathers. 

Swallow the air and mouthfuls of cold mist. Give voice, just once. O how it echoed from 
the rock! What a profound, angelic bell I rang! 

I live, I breathe, by swallowing. Once, some naughty children picked me up, me and 
two brothers. They set us down again somewhere and in our mouths they put lit cigarettes. 
We could not help but smoke them, to the end. I thought it was the death of me, but when 
I was entirely filled with smoke, when my slack mouth was burning, and all my tripes 
were and dry, they let us go. But I was sick for days. 

I have big shoulders, like a boxer. They are not muscle, however, and their color is dark. 
They are my sacs of poison, the almost unused poison that I bear, my burden and my 
great responsibility. Big wings of poison, folded on my back. Beware, I am an angel 
in disguise; my wings are evil, but not deadly. If I will it, the poison could break through, 
blue-black,and dangerous to all. Blue-black fumes would rise upon the air. Beware, 
you frivolous crab. 
 
12 O'Clock News

As you all know, tonight is the night of the full
moon, half the world over. But here the moon
seems to hang motionless in the sky. It gives very
little light; it could be dead. Visibility is poor.
Nevertheless, we shall try to give you some idea of
the lay of the land and the present situation.

The escapement that rises abruptly from the central
plain is in heavy shadow, but the elaborate terrac-
ing of its southern glacis gleams faintly in the dim
light, like fish scales. What endless labor those
small, peculiarly shaped terraces represent! And
yet, on them the welfare of this tiny principality
depends. 

pile of mss.

A slight landslide occurred in the northwest about
an hour ago. The exposed soil appears to be of poor
quality: almost white, calcareous, and shaly. There
are believed to have been no casualties.

Almost due north, our aerial reconnaissance reports
the discovery of a large rectangular ‘field’, hitherto
unknown to us, obviously man-made. It is dark-
speckled. An airstrip? A cemetery? 

envelopes

In this small, backward country, one of the most
backward left in the world today, communications
are crude and “industrialization” and its products
almost nonexistent. Strange to say, however, sign-
boards are on a truly gigantic scale. 

ink-bottle

We have also received reports of a mysterious, oddly
shaped, black structure, at an undisclosed distance
to the east. Its presence was revealed only because
its highly polished surface catches such feeble
moonlight as prevails. The natural resources of the
country being far from completely known to us,
there is the possibility that this may be, or may
contain, some powerful and terrifying “secret
weapon”. On the other hand, given what we do
know, or have learned from our anthropologists
and sociologists about this people, it may well be
nothing more than a numen, or a great altar
recently erected to one of their gods, to which, in
their present historical state of superstition and
helplessness, they attribute magical power, and
may even regard as a “savior,” one last hope of
rescue from their grave difficulties.

At last! One of the elusive natives has been spotted!
He appears to be—rather, to have been—a
unicyclist-courier, who may have met his end by
falling from the height of the escarpment because
of the deceptive illumination. Alive, he would have
been small, but undoubtedly proud and erect, with
the thick, bristling black hair typical of the
indigenes.

From our superior vantage point, we can clearly see
into a sort of dugout, possibly a shell crater, a “nest”
of soldiers. They lie heaped together, wearing the
camouflage “battle dress” intended for “winter war-
fare”. They are in hideously contorted position, all
dead. We can make out at least eight bodies. These
uniforms were designed to be used in guerilla
warfare on the country's one snow-covered moun-
tain peak. The fact that these poor soldiers are
wearing them here, on the plain, gives further
proof, if proof were necessary, either of the childish-
ness and hopeless impracticality of this inscrutable
people, our opponents, or of the sad corruption of their
leaders.

 

 

The Map
 
Land lies in water; it is shadowed green.
Shadows, or are they shallows, at its edges
showing the line of long sea-weeded ledges
where weeds hang to the simple blue from green.
Or does the land lean down to lift the sea from under,
drawing it unperturbed around itself?
Along the fine tan sandy shelf
is the land tugging at the sea from under?
 
The shadow of Newfoundland lies flat and still.
Labrador's yellow, where the moony Eskimo
has oiled it. We can stroke these lovely bays,
under a glass as if they were expected to blossom,
or as if to provide a clean cage for invisible fish.
The names of seashore towns run out to sea,
the names of cities cross the neighboring mountains
—the printer here experiencing the same excitement
as when emotion too far exceeds its cause.
These peninsulas take the water between thumb and finger
like women feeling for the smoothness of yard-goods.
 
Mapped waters are more quiet than the land is,
lending the land their waves' own conformation:
and Norway's hare runs south in agitation,
profiles investigate the sea, where land is.
Are they assigned, or can the countries pick their colors?
—What suits the character or the native waters best.
Topography displays no favorites; North's as near as West.
More delicate than the historians' are the map-makers' colors. 
 
 
 
The Man-Moth
 
Man-Moth: Newspaper misprint for "mammoth."
      
          Here, above,
cracks in the buldings are filled with battered moonlight.
The whole shadow of Man is only as big as his hat.
It lies at his feet like a circle for a doll to stand on,
and he makes an inverted pin, the point magnetized to the moon.
He does not see the moon; he observes only her vast properties,
feeling the queer light on his hands, neither warm nor cold,
of a temperature impossible to records in thermometers.
 
          But when the Man-Moth
pays his rare, although occasional, visits to the surface,
the moon looks rather different to him.  He emerges
from an opening under the edge of one of the sidewalks
and nervously begins to scale the faces of the buildings.
He thinks the moon is a small hole at the top of the sky,
proving the sky quite useless for protection.
He trembles, but must investigate as high as he can climb.
 
          Up the façades,
his shadow dragging like a photographer's cloth behind him
he climbs fearfully, thinking that this time he will manage
to push his small head through that round clean opening
and be forced through, as from a tube, in black scrolls on the light.
(Man, standing below him, has no such illusions.)
But what the Man-Moth fears most he must do, although 
he fails, of course, and falls back scared but quite unhurt.
 
          Then he returns
to the pale subways of cement he calls his home. He flits,
he flutters, and cannot get aboard the silent trains
fast enough to suit him.  The doors close swiftly.
The Man-Moth always seats himself facing the wrong way
and the train starts at once at its full, terrible speed, 
without a shift in gears or a gradation of any sort.
He cannot tell the rate at which he travels backwards.
 
          Each night he must
be carried through artificial tunnels and dream recurrent dreams.
Just as the ties recur beneath his train, these underlie
his rushing brain.  He does not dare look out the window,
for the third rail, the unbroken draught of poison,
runs there beside him. He regards it as a disease
he has inherited the susceptibility to.  He has to keep 
his hands in his pockets, as others must wear mufflers.
 
          If you catch him,
hold up a flashlight to his eye.  It's all dark pupil,
an entire night itself, whose haired horizon tightens
as he stares back, and closes up the eye.  Then from the lids 
one tear, his only possession, like the bee's sting, slips.
Slyly he palms it, and if you're not paying attention
he'll swallow it.  However, if you watch, he'll hand it over,
cool as from underground springs and pure enough to drink.
 
 
In the Waiting Room
 
In Worcester, Massachusetts,
I went with Aunt Consuelo
to keep her dentist's appointment
and sat and waited for her
in the dentist's waiting room.
It was winter. It got dark
early. The waiting room
was full of grown-up people,
arctics and overcoats,
lamps and magazines.
My aunt was inside
what seemed like a long time
and while I waited I read
the National Geographic 
(I could read) and carefully 
studied the photographs:
the inside of a volcano,
black, and full of ashes;
then it was spilling over
in rivulets of fire.
Osa and Martin Johnson 
dressed in riding breeches,
laced boots, and pith helmets.
A dead man slung on a pole
—"Long Pig," the caption said.
Babies with pointed heads
wound round and round with string;
black, naked women with necks
wound round and round with wire
like the necks of light bulbs.
Their breasts were horrifying.
I read it right straight through.
I was too shy to stop.
And then I looked at the cover:
the yellow margins, the date.
Suddenly, from inside,
came an oh! of pain
—Aunt Consuelo's voice—
not very loud or long.
I wasn't at all surprised;
even then I knew she was 
a foolish, timid woman.
I might have been embarrassed,
but wasn't.  What took me
completely by surprise
was that it was me:
my voice, in my mouth.
Without thinking at all
I was my foolish aunt,
I—we—were falling, falling,
our eyes glued to the cover
of the National Geographic,
February, 1918.
 
I said to myself: three days
and you'll be seven years old.
I was saying it to stop
the sensation of falling off
the round, turning world.
into cold, blue-black space.
But I felt: you are an I,
you are an Elizabeth,
you are one of them.
Why should you be one, too?
I scarcely dared to look
to see what it was I was.
I gave a sidelong glance
—I couldn't look any higher—
at shadowy gray knees,
trousers and skirts and boots
and different pairs of hands
lying under the lamps.
I knew that nothing stranger
had ever happened, that nothing
stranger could ever happen.
 
Why should I be my aunt,
or me, or anyone?
What similarities—
boots, hands, the family voice
I felt in my throat, or even
the National Geographic
and those awful hanging breasts--
held us all together
or made us all just one?
How--I didn't know any
word for it--how "unlikely". . .
How had I come to be here,
like them, and overhear
a cry of pain that could have
got loud and worse but hadn't?
 
The waiting room was bright
and too hot. It was sliding
beneath a big black wave,
another, and another.
 
Then I was back in it.
The War was on. Outside,
in Worcester, Massachusetts,
were night and slush and cold,
and it was still the fifth 
of February, 1918.
 
 
First Death in Nova Scotia
 
In the cold, cold parlor
my mother laid out Arthur
beneath the chromographs:
Edward, Prince of Wales,
with Princess Alexandra,
and King George with Queen Mary.
Below them on the table
stood a stuffed loon
shot and stuffed by Uncle
Arthur, Arthur's father.
 
Since Uncle Arthur fired
a bullet into him,
he hadn't said a word.
He kept his own counsel
on his white, frozen lake,
the marble-topped table.
His breast was deep and white,
cold and caressable;
his eyes were red glass,
much to be desired.
 
"Come," said my mother,
"Come and say good-bye
to your little cousin Arthur."
I was lifted up and given
one lily of the valley
to put in Arthur's hand.
Arthur's coffin was
a little frosted cake,
and the red-eyed loon eyed it
from his white, frozen lake.
 
Arthur was very small.
He was all white, like a doll
that hadn't been painted yet.
Jack Frost had started to paint him
the way he always painted
the Maple Leaf (Forever).
He had just begun on his hair,
a few red strokes, and then
Jack Frost had dropped the brush
and left him white, forever.
 
The gracious royal couples
were warm in red and ermine;
their feet were well wrapped up
in the ladies' ermine trains.
They invited Arthur to be
the smallest page at court.
But how could Arthur go,
clutching his tiny lily,
with his eyes shut up so tight
and the roads deep in snow? 
 
Sestina

September rain falls on the house. 
In the failing light, the old grandmother 
sits in the kitchen with the child 
beside the Little Marvel Stove, 
reading the jokes from the almanac, 
laughing and talking to hide her tears.

She thinks that her equinoctial tears 
and the rain that beats on the roof of the house 
were both foretold by the almanac, 
but only known to a grandmother. 
The iron kettle sings on the stove. 
She cuts some bread and says to the child,

It's time for tea now; but the child 
is watching the teakettle's small hard tears 
dance like mad on the hot black stove, 
the way the rain must dance on the house. 
Tidying up, the old grandmother 
hangs up the clever almanac

on its string.  Birdlike, the almanac 
hovers half open above the child, 
hovers above the old grandmother 
and her teacup full of dark brown tears. 
She shivers and says she thinks the house 
feels chilly, and puts more wood in the stove.

It was to be, says the Marvel Stove. 
I know what I know, says the almanac. 
With crayons the child draws a rigid house 
and a winding pathway.  Then the child 
puts in a man with buttons like tears 
and shows it proudly to the grandmother.

But secretly, while the grandmother 
busies herself about the stove, 
the little moons falls down like tears 
from between the pages of the almanac 
into the flower bed the child 
has carefully placed in the front of the house.

Time to plant tears, says the almanac. 
The grandmother sings to the marvelous stove 
and the child draws another inscrutable house.

 

 

A Miracle for Breakfast

At six o'clock we were waiting for coffee, 
waiting for coffee and the charitable crumb 
that was going to be served from a certain balcony 
--like kings of old, or like a miracle. 
It was still dark. One foot of the sun 
steadied itself on a long ripple in the river. 

The first ferry of the day had just crossed the river. 
It was so cold we hoped that the coffee 
would be very hot, seeing that the sun 
was not going to warm us; and that the crumb 
would be a loaf each, buttered, by a miracle. 
At seven a man stepped out on the balcony. 

He stood for a minute alone on the balcony 
looking over our heads toward the river. 
A servant handed him the makings of a miracle, 
consisting of one lone cup of coffee 
and one roll, which he proceeded to crumb, 
his head, so to speak, in the clouds--along with the sun. 

Was the man crazy? What under the sun 
was he trying to do, up there on his balcony! 
Each man received one rather hard crumb, 
which some flicked scornfully into the river, 
and, in a cup, one drop of the coffee. 
Some of us stood around, waiting for the miracle. 

I can tell what I saw next; it was not a miracle. 
A beautiful villa stood in the sun 
and from its doors came the smell of hot coffee. 
In front, a baroque white plaster balcony 
added by birds, who nest along the river, 
--I saw it with one eye close to the crumb-- 

and galleries and marble chambers. My crumb 
my mansion, made for me by a miracle, 
through ages, by insects, birds, and the river 
working the stone. Every day, in the sun, 
at breakfast time I sit on my balcony 
with my feet up, and drink gallons of coffee. 

We licked up the crumb and swallowed the coffee. 
A window across the river caught the sun 
as if the miracle were working, on the wrong balcony.

 

Questions of Travel

There are too many waterfalls here; the crowded streams 
hurry too rapidly down to the sea, 
and the pressure of so many clouds on the mountaintops 
makes them spill over the sides in soft slow-motion, 
turning to waterfalls under our very eyes. 
--For if those streaks, those mile-long, shiny, tearstains, 
aren't waterfalls yet, 
in a quick age or so, as ages go here, 
they probably will be. 
But if the streams and clouds keep travelling, travelling, 
the mountains look like the hulls of capsized ships, 
slime-hung and barnacled. 

Think of the long trip home. 
Should we have stayed at home and thought of here? 
Where should we be today? 
Is it right to be watching strangers in a play 
in this strangest of theatres? 
What childishness is it that while there's a breath of life 
in our bodies, we are determined to rush 
to see the sun the other way around? 
The tiniest green hummingbird in the world? 
To stare at some inexplicable old stonework, 
inexplicable and impenetrable, 
at any view, 
instantly seen and always, always delightful? 
Oh, must we dream our dreams 
and have them, too? 
And have we room 
for one more folded sunset, still quite warm? 

But surely it would have been a pity 
not to have seen the trees along this road, 
really exaggerated in their beauty, 
not to have seen them gesturing 
like noble pantomimists, robed in pink. 
--Not to have had to stop for gas and heard 
the sad, two-noted, wooden tune 
of disparate wooden clogs 
carelessly clacking over 
a grease-stained filling-station floor. 
(In another country the clogs would all be tested. 
Each pair there would have identical pitch.) 
--A pity not to have heard 
the other, less primitive music of the fat brown bird 
who sings above the broken gasoline pump 
in a bamboo church of Jesuit baroque: 
three towers, five silver crosses. 
--Yes, a pity not to have pondered, 
blurr'dly and inconclusively, 
on what connection can exist for centuries 
between the crudest wooden footwear 
and, careful and finicky, 
the whittled fantasies of wooden footwear 
and, careful and finicky, 
the whittled fantasies of wooden cages. 
--Never to have studied history in 
the weak calligraphy of songbirds' cages. 
--And never to have had to listen to rain 
so much like politicians' speeches: 
two hours of unrelenting oratory 
and then a sudden golden silence 
in which the traveller takes a notebook, writes: 

"Is it lack of imagination that makes us come 
to imagined places, not just stay at home? 
Or could Pascal have been not entirely right 
about just sitting quietly in one's room? 

Continent, city, country, society: 
the choice is never wide and never free. 
And here, or there . . . No. Should we have stayed at home, 
wherever that may be?"

 

Song for the Rainy Season

Hidden, oh hidden 
in the high fog 
the house we live in, 
beneath the magnetic rock, 
rain-, rainbow-ridden, 
where blood-black 
bromelias, lichens, 
owls, and the lint 
of the waterfalls cling, 
familiar, unbidden. 

In a dim age 
of water 
the brook sings loud 
from a rib cage 
of giant fern; vapor 
climbs up the thick growth 
effortlessly, turns back, 
holding them both, 
house and rock, 
in a private cloud. 

At night, on the roof, 
blind drops crawl 
and the ordinary brown 
owl gives us proof 
he can count: 
five times--always five-- 
he stamps and takes off 
after the fat frogs that, 
shrilling for love, 
clamber and mount. 

House, open house 
to the white dew 
and the milk-white sunrise 
kind to the eyes, 
to membership 
of silver fish, mouse, 
bookworms, 
big moths; with a wall 
for the mildew's 
ignorant map; 

darkened and tarnished 
by the warm touch 
of the warm breath, 
maculate, cherished; 
rejoice! For a later 
era will differ. 
(O difference that kills 
or intimidates, much 
of all our small shadowy 
life!) Without water 

the great rock will stare 
unmagnetized, bare, 
no longer wearing 
rainbows or rain, 
the forgiving air 
and the high fog gone; 
the owls will move on 
and the several 
waterfalls shrivel 
in the steady sun. 

 

Filling Stations

Oh, but it is dirty!
--this little filling station,
oil-soaked, oil-permeated
to a disturbing, over-all
Be careful with that match!

Father wears a dirty,
oil-soaked monkey suit
that cuts him under the arms,
and several quick and saucy
and greasy sons assist him
(it's a family filling station),
all quite thoroughly dirty.

Do they live in the station?
It has a cement porch
behind the pumps, and on it
a set of crushed and grease-
impregnated wickerwork;
on the wicker sofa
a dirty dog, quite comfy.

Some comic books provide
the only note of color--
of certain color. They lie
upon a big dim doily
draping a taboret
(part of the set), beside
a big hirsute begonia.

Why the extraneous plant?
Why the taboret?
Why, oh why, the doily?
(Embroidered in daisy stitch
with marguerites, I think,
and heavy with gray crochet.)

Somebody embroidered the doily.
Somebody waters the plant,
or oils it, maybe. Somebody
arranges the rows of cans
so that they softly say:
ESSO--SO--SO--SO

to high-strung automobiles.
Somebody loves us all.


In the Waiting Room
 
In Worcester, Massachusetts,
I went with Aunt Consuelo
to keep her dentist's appointment
and sat and waited for her
in the dentist's waiting room.
It was winter. It got dark
early. The waiting room
was full of grown-up people,
arctics and overcoats,
lamps and magazines.
My aunt was inside
what seemed like a long time
and while I waited I read
the National Geographic 
(I could read) and carefully 
studied the photographs:
the inside of a volcano,
black, and full of ashes;
then it was spilling over
in rivulets of fire.
Osa and Martin Johnson 
dressed in riding breeches,
laced boots, and pith helmets.
A dead man slung on a pole
—"Long Pig," the caption said.
Babies with pointed heads
wound round and round with string;
black, naked women with necks
wound round and round with wire
like the necks of light bulbs.
Their breasts were horrifying.
I read it right straight through.
I was too shy to stop.
And then I looked at the cover:
the yellow margins, the date.
Suddenly, from inside,
came an oh! of pain
—Aunt Consuelo's voice—
not very loud or long.
I wasn't at all surprised;
even then I knew she was 
a foolish, timid woman.
I might have been embarrassed,
but wasn't.  What took me
completely by surprise
was that it was me:
my voice, in my mouth.
Without thinking at all
I was my foolish aunt,
I—we—were falling, falling,
our eyes glued to the cover
of the National Geographic,
February, 1918.
 
I said to myself: three days
and you'll be seven years old.
I was saying it to stop
the sensation of falling off
the round, turning world.
into cold, blue-black space.
But I felt: you are an I,
you are an Elizabeth,
you are one of them.
Why should you be one, too?
I scarcely dared to look
to see what it was I was.
I gave a sidelong glance
—I couldn't look any higher—
at shadowy gray knees,
trousers and skirts and boots
and different pairs of hands
lying under the lamps.
I knew that nothing stranger
had ever happened, that nothing
stranger could ever happen.
 
Why should I be my aunt,
or me, or anyone?
What similarities—
boots, hands, the family voice
I felt in my throat, or even
the National Geographic
and those awful hanging breasts--
held us all together
or made us all just one?
How--I didn't know any
word for it--how "unlikely". . .
How had I come to be here,
like them, and overhear
a cry of pain that could have
got loud and worse but hadn't?
 
The waiting room was bright
and too hot. It was sliding
beneath a big black wave,
another, and another.
 
Then I was back in it.
The War was on. Outside,
in Worcester, Massachusetts,
were night and slush and cold,
and it was still the fifth 
of February, 1918.
 
 
First Death in Nova Scotia
 
In the cold, cold parlor
my mother laid out Arthur
beneath the chromographs:
Edward, Prince of Wales,
with Princess Alexandra,
and King George with Queen Mary.
Below them on the table
stood a stuffed loon
shot and stuffed by Uncle
Arthur, Arthur's father.
 
Since Uncle Arthur fired
a bullet into him,
he hadn't said a word.
He kept his own counsel
on his white, frozen lake,
the marble-topped table.
His breast was deep and white,
cold and caressable;
his eyes were red glass,
much to be desired.
 
"Come," said my mother,
"Come and say good-bye
to your little cousin Arthur."
I was lifted up and given
one lily of the valley
to put in Arthur's hand.
Arthur's coffin was
a little frosted cake,
and the red-eyed loon eyed it
from his white, frozen lake.
 
Arthur was very small.
He was all white, like a doll
that hadn't been painted yet.
Jack Frost had started to paint him
the way he always painted
the Maple Leaf (Forever).
He had just begun on his hair,
a few red strokes, and then
Jack Frost had dropped the brush
and left him white, forever.
 
The gracious royal couples
were warm in red and ermine;
their feet were well wrapped up
in the ladies' ermine trains.
They invited Arthur to be
the smallest page at court.
But how could Arthur go,
clutching his tiny lily,
with his eyes shut up so tight
and the roads deep in snow?

Number 20 (froom A Coney Island of the Mind)

        The pennycandystore beyond the El
       is where I first
                       fell in love
                                   with unreality
       Jellybeans glowed in the semi-gloom
       of that september afternoon
       A cat upon the counter moved among
                                 the licorice sticks
                      and tootsie rolls
              and Oh Boy Gum

       Outside the leaves were falling as they died

       A wind had blown away the sun

       A girl ran in 
       Her hair was rainy
       Her breasts were breathless in the little room

       Outside the leaves were falling
                            and they cried
                                         Too soon!  too soon!

Ode to My Socks 
 

Maru Mori brought me 
a pair 
of socks 
which she knitted herself 
with her sheepherder's hands, 
two socks as soft as rabbits. 
I slipped my feet 
into them 
as though into 
two 
cases 
knitted 
with threads of 
twilight 
and goatskin. 
Violent socks, 
my feet were 
two fish made 
of wool, 
two long sharks 
sea-blue, shot 
through 
by one golden thread, 
two immense blackbirds, 
two cannons: 
my feet 
were honored 
in this way 
by 
these 
heavenly 
socks. 
They were 
so handsome 
for the first time 
my feet seemed to me 
unacceptable 
like two decrepit 
firemen, firemen 
unworthy 
of that woven 
fire, 
of those glowing 
socks.

Nevertheless 
I resisted 
the sharp temptation 
to save them somewhere 
as schoolboys 
keep 
fireflies, 
as learned men 
collect 
sacred texts, 
I resisted 
the mad impulse 
to put them 
into a golden 
cage 
and each day give them 
birdseed 
and pieces of pink melon. 
Like exploreres 
in the jungle who hand 
over the very rare 
green deer 
to the spit 
and eat it 
with remorse, 
I stretched out 
my feet 
and pulled on 
the magnificent 
socks 
and then my shoes.

The moral 
of my ode is this: 
beauty is twice 
beauty 
and what is good is doubly 
good 
when it is a matter of two socks 
made of wool 
in winter.

  
 

Ode to Salt

This salt 
in the saltcellar 
I once saw in the salt mines. 
I know 
you won't 
believe me, 
but 
it sings, 
salt sings, the skin 
of the salt mines, 
sings 
with a mouth smothered 
by the earth. 
I shivered in those 
solitudes 
when I heard 
the voice 
of 
the salt 
in the desert. 
Near Antofagasta 
the nitrous 
pampa 
resounds: 
a 
broken 
voice, 
a mournful 
song.

In its caves 
the salt moans, mountain 
of buried light, 
crystal of the sea, oblivion 
of the waves.

And then on every table 
in the world, 
salt, 
we see your piquant 
powder 
sprinkling 
vital light 
upon 
our food. 
Preserver 
of the ancient 
holds of ships, 
discoverer 
on 
the high seas, 
earliest 
sailor 
of the unknown, shifting 
byways of the foam. 
Dust of the sea, in you 
the tongue receives a kiss 
from ocean night: 
taste imparts to every seasoned 
dish your ocean essence; 
the smallest 
miniature 
wave from the saltcellar 
reveals to us 
more than domestic whitenesss; 
in it, we taste infinitude.

 

Ode to the Watermelon

The tree of intense 
summer, 
hard, 
is all blue sky, 
yellow sun, fatigue in drops, 
a sword 
above the highways, 
a scorched shoe 
in the cities: 
the brightness and the world 
weigh us down, 
hit us 
in the eyes 
with clouds of dust, 
with sudden golden blows, 
they torture 
our feet 
with tiny thorns, 
with hot stones, 
and the mouth 
suffers 
more than all the toes: 
the throat 
becomes thirsty, 
the teeth, 
the lips, the tongue: 
we want to drink 
waterfalls, 
the dark blue night, 
the South Pole, 
and then 
the coolest of all 
the planets crosses 
the sky, 
the round, magnificent, 
star-filled watermelon.

It's a fruit from the thirst-tree. 
It's the green whale of the summer.

The dry universe 
all at once 
given dark stars 
by this firmament of coolness 
lets the swelling 
fruit 
come down: 
its hemispheres open 
showing a flag 
green, white, red, 
that dissolves into 
wild rivers, sugar, 
delight!

Jewel box of water, phlegmatic 
queen 
of the fruitshops, 
warehouse 
of profundity, moon 
on earth! 
You are pure, 
rubies fall apart 
in your abundance, 
and we 
want 
to bite into you, 
to bury our 
face 
in you, and 
our hair, and 
the soul! 
When we're thirsty 
we glimpse you 
like 
a mine or a mountain 
of fantastic food, 
but 
among our longings and our teeth 
you change 
simply 
into cool light 
that slips in turn into 
spring water 
that touched us once 
singing. 
And that is why 
you don't weigh us down 
in the siesta hour 
that's like an oven, 
you don't weigh us down, 
you just 
go by 
and your heart, some cold ember, 
turned itself into a single 
drop of water.

 

America, I Do Not Call Your Name without Hope

America, I do not call your name without hope. 
When I hold the sword against the heart, 
when I live with the faulty roof in the soul, 
when one of your new days 
pierces me coming through the windows, 
I am and I stand in the light that produces me, 
I live in the darkness which makes me what I am, 
I sleep and awake in your fundamental sunrise: 
as mild as the grapes, and as terrible, 
carrier of sugar and the whip, 
soaked in the sperm of your species, 
nursed on the blood of your inheritance.

 

Body of a Woman

Body of a woman, white hills, white thighs, 
you like a world, lying in surrentder. 
My rough peasant's body digs in you 
and makes the son leap from the depth of the earth.

I was alone like a tunnel.  The birds fled from me, 
and night swamped me with its crushing invasion. 
To survive myself I forged you like a weapon, 
like an arrow in my bow, a stone in my sling.

But the hour of vengeance falls, and I love you. 
Body of skin, of moss, of eager and firm milk. 
Oh the goblets of the breast!  Oh the eyes of absence! 
Oh the roses of the publis!  Oh your voice, slow and sad!

Body of my woman, I will persist in your grace. 
My thirst, my boundless desire, my shifting road! 
Dark river-beds where the eternal thirst flows 
and weariness follows, and the infinite ache.

 

Walking Around

It so happens I'm tired of just being a man. 
I go to a movie, drop in at the tailor's--it so happens-- 
feeling wizened and numbed, like a big, wooly swan, 
awash on an ocean of clinkers and causes.

A whiff from a barbershop does it; I yell bloody murder. 
All I ask is a little vacation from things:  from boulders and woolens, 
from gardens, institutional projects, merchandise, 
eyeglasses, elevators--I'd rather not look at them.

It so happens I'm fed up--with my feet and my fingernails 
and my hair and my shadow. 
Being a man leaves me cold:  that's how it is.

Still—it would be lovely 
to wave a cut lily and panic a notary, 
or finish a nun with a left to the ear. 
It would be nice 
just to walk down the street with a green switchblade handy, 
whooping it up till I die of the shivers.

I won't live like this—like a root in a shadow, 
wide-open and wondering, teeth chattering sleepily, 
going down to the dripping entrails of the universe 
absorbing things, talking things in, eating three squares a day.

I've had all I'll take from catastrophe. 
I won't have it this way, muddling through like a root or a grave, 
all alone underground, in a morgue of cadavers, 
cold as a stiff, dying of misery.

That's why Monday flares up like an oil-slick, 
when it sees me up close, with the face of a jailbird, 
or squeaks like a broken-down wheel as it goes, 
stepping hot-blooded into the night.

Something shoves me toward certain damp houses, into certain dark corners, 
into hospitals, with bones flying out of the windows; 
into shoe stores and shoemakers smelling of vinegar, 
streets frightful as fissures laid open.

There, trussed to the doors of the houses I loathe 
are the sulphurous birds, in a horror of tripes, 
dental plates lost in a coffeepot, mirrors 
that must surely have wept with the nightmare and shame of it all; 
and everywhere, poisons, umbrellas, and belly buttons.

I stroll unabashed, in my eyes and my shoes 
and my rage and oblivion. 
I go on, crossing offices, retail orthopedics, 
courtyards with laundry hung out on a wire; 
the blouses and towels and the drawers newly washed, 
slowly dribbling a slovenly tear.


 


It so happens I am sick of being a man. 
And it happens that I walk into tailorshops and movie houses 
dried up, waterproof, like a swan made of felt 
steering my way in a water of wombs and ashes.

The smell of barbershops makes me break into hoarse sobs. 
The only thing I want is to lie still like stones or wool. 
The only thing I want is to see no more stores, no gardens, 
no more goods, no spectacles, no elevators.

It so happens I am sick of my feet and my nails 
and my hair and my shadow. 
It so happens I am sick of being a man.

Still it would be marvelous 
to terrify a law clerk with a cut lilly, 
or kill a nun with a blow on the ear. 
It would be great 
to go through the streets with a green knife 
letting out yells until I died of the cold.

I don't want to go on being a root in the dark, 
insecure, stretched out, shivering with sleep, 
going on down, into the moist guts of the earth, 
taking in and thinking, eating every day.

I don't want so much misery. 
I don't want to go on as a root and a tomb, 
alone under the ground, a warehouse with corpses, 
half frozen, dying of grief.

That's why Monday, when it sees me coming 
with my convict face, blazes up like gasoline, 
and it howls on its way like a wounded wheel, 
and leaves tracks full of warm blood leading toward the night.

And it pushes me into certain corners, into some moist houses, 
into hospitals where the bones fly out the window, 
into shoeshops that smell like vinegar, 
and certain streets hideous as cracks in the skin.

There are sulpher-colored birds, and hideous intestines 
hanging over the doors of houses that I hate, 
and there are false teeth forgotten in a coffeepot, 
there are mirrors 
that ought to have wept from shame and terror, 
there are umbrellas everywhere, and venoms, and umbilical cords.

I stroll along serenely, with my eyes, my shoes, 
my rage, forgetting everything, 
I walk by, going through the office buildings and orthopedic shops, 
and courtyards with washing hanging from the line: 
underwear, towels and shirts from which slow 
dirty tears are falling.

 


It happens that I am tired of being a man. 
It happens that I go into the tailor's shops and the movies 
all shrivelled up, impenetrable, like a felt swan 
navigating on a water of origin and ash.

The smell of barber shops makes me sob out loud. 
I want nothing but the repose either of stone or of wool. 
I want to see no more establishments, no more gardens, 
nor merchandise, nor glasses, nor elevators.

It happens that I am tired of my feet and my nails 
and my hair and my shadow. 
It happens that I am tired of being a man.

Just the same it would be delicious 
to scare a notary with a cut lily 
or knock a nun stone dead with one blow of an ear. 
It would be beautiful 
to go through the streets with a green knife 
shouting until I died of cold.

I do not want to go on being a root in the dark, 
hesitating, stretched out, shivering with dreams, 
downwards, in the wet tripe of the earth, 
soaking it up and thinking, eating every day.

I do not want to be the inheritor of so many misfortunes. 
I do not want to continue as a root and as a tomb, 
as a solitary tunnel, as a cellar full of corpses, 
stiff with cold, dying with pain.

For this reason Monday burns like oil 
at the sight of me arriving with my jail-face, 
and it howls in passing like a wounded wheel, 
and its footsteps towards nightfall are filled with hot blood.

And it shoves me along to certain corners, to certain damp houses, 
to hospitals where the bones come out of the windows, 
to certain cobbler's shops smelling of vinegar, 
to streets horrendous as crevices.

There are birds the colour of sulphur, and horrible intestines 
hanging from the doors of the houses which I hate, 
there are forgotten sets of teeth in a coffee-pot, 
there are mirrors 
which should have wept with shame and horror, 
there are umbrellas all over the place, and poisons, and navels.

I stride along with calm, with eyes, with shoes, 
with fury, with forgetfuless, 
I pass, I cross offices and stores full of orthopedic appliances, 
and courtyards hung with clothes on wires, 
underpants, towels and shirts which weep 
slow dirty tears.

 

And How Long?

How much does a man live, after all?

Does he live a thousand days, or one only?

For a week, or for several centuries?

How long does a man spend dying?

What does it mean to say 'for ever'?

Lost in this preoccupation, 
I set myself to clear things up.

I sought out knowledgable priests, 
I waited for them after their rituals, 
I watched them when they went their ways 
to visit God and the Devil.

They wearied of my questions. 
They on their part knew very little. 
They were no more than administrators.

Medical men received me 
in between consultations, 
a scalpel in each hand, 
saturated in aureomycin, 
busier each day. 
As far as I could tell from their talk, 
the problem was as follows: 
it was not so much the death of a microbe-- 
they went down by the ton, 
but the few which survived 
showed signs of perversity.

They left me so startled 
that I sought out the grave-diggers. 
I went to the rivers where they burn 
enormous painted corpses, 
tiny bony bodies, 
emperors with an aura 
of terrible curses, 
women snuffed out at a stroke 
by a wave of cholera. 
There were whole beaches of dead 
and ashy specialists.

When I got the chance 
I asked them a slew of questions. 
They offered to burn me. 
It was all they knew.

In my own country the dead 
answered me, between drinks: 
'Get yourself a good woman 
and give up this nonsense.'

I never saw people so happy.

Raising their glasses they sang 
toasting health and death. 
They were huge fornicators.

I returned home, much older 
after crossing the world.

Now I ask questions of nobody,

But I know less every day. 
  
 

Tonight I Can Write

Tonight I can write the saddest lines.

Write, for example, 'The night is starry
and the stars are blue and shiver in the distance.'

The night wind revolves in the sky and sings.

Tonight I can write the saddest lines.
I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.

Through nights like this one I held her in my arms.
I kissed her again and again under the endless sky.

She loved me, sometimes I loved her too.
How could one not have loved her great still eyes.

Tonight I can write the saddest lines.
To think that I do not have her. To feel that I have lost her.

To hear the immense night, still more immense without her.
And the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture.

What does it matter that my love could not keep her.
The night is starry and she is not with me.

This is all. In the distance someone is singing. In the distance.
My soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.

My sight tries to find her as though to bring her closer.
My heart looks for her, and she is not with me.

The same night whitening the same trees.
We, of that time, are no longer the same.

I no longer love her, that's certain, but how I loved her.
My voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing.

Another's. She will be another's. As she was before my kisses.
Her voice, her bright body. Her infinite eyes.

I no longer love her, that's certain, but maybe I love her.
Love is so short, forgetting is so long.

Because through nights like this one I held her in my arms
my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.

Though this be the last pain that she makes me suffer
and these the last verses that I write for her.


Ode To The Lemon
From blossoms
released
by the moonlight,
from an
aroma of exasperated
love,
steeped in fragrance,
yellowness
drifted from the lemon tree,
and from its plantarium
lemons descended to the earth.

Tender yield!
The coasts,
the markets glowed
with light, with
unrefined gold;
we opened
two halves
of a miracle,
congealed acid
trickled
from the hemispheres
of a star,
the most intense liqueur
of nature,
unique, vivid,
concentrated,
born of the cool, fresh
lemon,
of its fragrant house,
its acid, secret symmetry.

Knives
sliced a small
cathedral
in the lemon,
the concealed apse, opened,
revealed acid stained glass,
drops
oozed topaz,
altars,
cool architecture.

So, when you hold
the hemisphere
of a cut lemon
above your plate,
you spill
a universe of gold,
a
yellow goblet
of miracles,
a fragrant nipple
of the earth's breast,
a ray of light that was made fruit,
the minute fire of a planet.


Shirt

The back, the yoke, the yardage. Lapped seams,
The nearly invisible stitches along the collar
Turned in a sweatshop by Koreans or Malaysians

Gossiping over tea and noodles on their break
Or talking money or politics while one fitted
This armpiece with its overseam to the band

Of cuff I button at my wrist. The presser, the cutter,
The wringer, the mangle. The needle, the union,
The treadle, the bobbin. The code. The infamous blaze

At the Triangle Factory in nineteen-eleven.
One hundred and forty-six died in the flames
On the ninth floor, no hydrants, no fire escapes—

The witness in a building across the street
Who watched how a young man helped a girl to step
Up to the windowsill, then held her out

Away from the masonry wall and let her drop.
And then another. As if he were helping them up
To enter a streetcar, and not eternity.

A third before he dropped her put her arms
Around his neck and kissed him. Then he held
Her into space, and dropped her. Almost at once

He stepped up to the sill himself, his jacket flared
And fluttered up from his shirt as he came down,
Air filling up the legs of his gray trousers—

Like Hart Crane's Bedlamite, "shrill shirt ballooning."
Wonderful how the pattern matches perfectly
Across the placket and over the twin bar-tacked

Corners of both pockets, like a strict rhyme
Or a major chord. Prints, plaids, checks,
Houndstooth, Tattersall, Madras. The clan tartans

Invented by mill-owners inspired by the hoax of Ossian,
To control their savage Scottish workers, tamed
By a fabricated heraldry: MacGregor,

Bailey, MacMartin. The kilt, devised for workers
to wear among the dusty clattering looms.
Weavers, carders, spinners. The loader,

The docker, the navvy. The planter, the picker, the sorter
Sweating at her machine in a litter of cotton
As slaves in calico headrags sweated in fields:

George Herbert, your descendant is a Black
Lady in South Carolina, her name is Irma
And she inspected my shirt. Its color and fit

And feel and its clean smell have satisfied
both her and me. We have culled its cost and quality
Down to the buttons of simulated bone,

The buttonholes, the sizing, the facing, the characters
Printed in black on neckband and tail. The shape,
The label, the labor, the color, the shade. The shirt.

 
The Pleasures of the Door

 

 

Kings do not touch doors.

            They know nothing of this pleasure: pushing before one gently or brusquely one of those large familiar panels, then turning back to replace it—holding a door in one’s arms.

            …The pleasure of grabbing the midriff of one of these tall obstacles to a room by its porcelain node; that short clinch during which movement stops, the eye widens, and the whole body adjusts to its new surrounding.

            With a friendly hand one still holds on to it, before closing it decisively and shutting oneself in—which the click of the tight but well-oiled spring pleasantly confirms.

 

 

 

 

Water

 

            Below me, always below me is water.  Always with lowered eye do I look at it.  It is like the ground, like a part of the ground, a modification of the ground.

            It is bright and brilliant, formless and fresh, passive yet persistent in its one vice, gravity; disposing of extraordinary means to satisfy that vice—twisting, piercing, eroding, filtering.

            This vice works from within as well: water collapses all the time, constantly sacrifices all form, tends only to humble itself, flattens itself on the ground, like a corpse, like the monks of certain orders.  Always lower—that could be its motto; the opposite of excelsior.

 

*

            One might almost say that water is mad, because of its hysterical need to obey gravity alone, a need that possesses it like an obsession.

            Of course, everything in the world responds to this need, which always and everywhere must be satisfied.  This cabinet, for example, proves to be terribly stubborn in its desire to stay on the ground, and if one day it found itself badly balanced, would sooner fall to pieces than run counter to that desire.But to a certain degree it teases gravity, defies it; does not give way in all its parts: its cornice, its moldings do not give in. Inherent in the cabinet is a resistance that benefits its personality and form.

            LIQUID, by definition, is that which chooses to obey gravity rather than maintain its form, which rejects all form in order to obey gravity—and which loses all dignity because of that obsession, that pathological anxiety.  Because of that vice—which makes it fast, flowing, or stagnant, formless or fearsome, formless and fearsome, piercingly fearsome in cases; devious, filtering, winding—one can do anything one wants with it, even lead water through pipes to make it spout out vertically so as to enjoy the way it collapses in droplets:  a real slave.

            The sun and the moon, however, are envious of this exclusive influence, and try to take over whenever water happens to offer the opening of great expanses, and above all when in a state of least resistance—spread out in shallow puddles.  Then the sun exacts an even greater tribute: forces it into a perpetual cycle, treats it like a gerbil on a wheel.

 

*

 

            Water eludes me…slips between my fingers.  And even so! It’s not even that clean (like a lizard or a frog): it leaves traces, spots, on my hands that are quite slow to dry or have to be wiped. Water escapes me yet marks me, and there is not a thing I can do about it.

            Ideologically it’s the same thing: it eludes me, eludes all definition, but in my mind and on this sheet leaves traces, formless marks.

 

*

 

            Water’s instability: sensitive to the slightest change of level.  Running down stairs two at a time.  Playful, childishly obedient, returning as soon as called if one alters the slope on this side.

 

 

 

 

The Horse

 

        Many times the size of a man, the horse has flaring nostrils, round eyes under half-closed lids, cocked ears and long muscular neck.

            The tallest of man’s domestic animals, and truly his designated mount.

            Man, somewhat lost on an elephant, is at his best on a horse, truly a throne to his measure.

            We will not do away with the horse, I hope?

            He will not become a curiosity in a zoo?

           …Already now, in town, he is no more than a miserable substitute for the automobile, the most miserable means of traction.

            Ah, the horse is also—does man suspect it?—something else besides! He is impatience nostrilized.

            His weapons are running, biting, bucking.

            He seems to have a keen nose, keen ears, and very sensitive eyes.

            The greatest tribute one can pay him is having to fit him with blinders.

            But no weapon…
            Whereby the temptation to add one.  One only.  A horn.  Thereby the unicorn.

 

            The horse, terribly nervous, is aerophagous.

            Hypersensitive, he clamps his jaws, holds his breath, then releases it, making the walls of his nasal cavities vibrate loudly.

            That is why this noble beast, who feeds on air and grass alone, produces only straw turds and thunderous fragrant farts.

            Fragrant thunderisms.

 

            What am I saying, feeds on air?  Gets drunk on it.  Sniffs it, savors it, snorts it.

            He rushes into it, shakes his mane in it, kicks up his hind legs in it.

            He would evidently like to fly up into it.

            The flight of clouds inspires him, urges him to imitation.

            He does imitate it: he tosses, prances…

            And when the whip’s lightning claps, the clouds gallop faster and rain tramples the earth…

 

            Out of your stall, high-spirited over-sensitive armoire, all polished and smoothed!

            Great beautiful period piece!

            Polished ebony or mahogany.

            Stroke the withers of this armoire and immediately it has a faraway look.

            Dust cloth at the lips,feather mop at the rump, key in the lock of the nostrils.

 

            His skin quivers, irritably tolerating flies, his shoe hammers the ground.

            He lowers his head, leans his muzzle toward the ground and consoles himself with grass.

            A stepstool is needed to look on the upper shelf.

            Ticklish skin, as I was saying…but his natural impatience is so profound, that inside his body the parts of his skeleton behave like pebbles in a torrent!

 

            Seen from the apse, the highest animal nave in the stable…

 

            Great saint! Great horse! Beautiful behind in the stable…

            What is this splendid courtesan’s behind that greets me, set on slim legs, high heels?

            Giant goose of the golden eggs, strangely clipped.

            Ah, it is the smell of gold that assails my nostrils!

            Leather and manure mixed together.

            Strong-smelling omelette, from the goose of the golden eggs.

            Straw omelette, earth omelette, flavored with the rum of your urine, dropping from the crack under your tail…

            As though fresh from the oven, on a pastry sheet, the stable’s rolls and rum balls.

            Great saint, with your Byzantine eyes, woeful, under the harness…

 

            A sort of saint, humble monk at prayer, in the twilight.

            A monk?  What am I saying?…A pontiff, on his excremental palanquin! A pope—exhibiting to all comers a splendid courtesan’s behind, generously heart-shaped, on slender legs ending elegantly in high-heeled shoes.

            WHAT IS THIS CLACKING OF THE BIT?

            THESE DULL THUDS IN THE STALL?

            WHAT’S GOING ON?

            PONTIFF AT PRAYER?

            SCHOOLBOY IN DETENTION?

            GREAT SAINTS! GREAT HORSES (HORSES OR HEROES?), OF THE BEAUTIFUL BEHIND IN THE STABLE,

WHY, SAINTLY MONK, ARE YOU WEARING RIDING BREECHES?

—INTERRUPTED DURING HIS MASS, HE TURNED HIS BYZATINE EYES TOWARD US…



“the withness of the body” –Whitehead

The heavy bear who goes with me,
A manifold honey to smear his face,
Clumsy and lumbering here and there,
The central ton of every place,
The hungry beating brutish one
In love with candy, anger, and sleep,
Crazy factotum, disheveling all,
Climbs the building, kicks the football,
Boxes his brother in the hate-ridden city.

Breathing at my side, that heavy animal,
That heavy bear who sleeps with me,
Howls in his sleep for a world of sugar,
A sweetness intimate as the water’s clasp,
Howls in his sleep because the tight-rope
Trembles and shows the darkness beneath.
–The strutting show-off is terrified,
Dressed in his dress-suit, bulging his pants,
Trembles to think that his quivering meat
Must finally wince to nothing at all.

That inescapable animal walks with me,
Has followed me since the black womb held,
Moves where I move, distorting my gesture,
A caricature, a swollen shadow,
A stupid clown of the spirit’s motive,
Perplexes and affronts with his own darkness,
The secret life of belly and bone,
Opaque, too near, my private, yet unknown,
Stretches to embrace the very dear
With whom I would walk without him near,
Touches her grossly, although a word
Would bare my heart and make me clear,
Stumbles, flounders, and strives to be fed
Dragging me with him in his mouthing care,
Amid the hundred million of his kind,
The scrimmage of appetite everywhere.


Fork

This strange thing must have crept 
Right out of hell. 
It resembles a bird's foot 
Worn around the cannibal's neck. 
As you hold it in your hand, 
As you stab with it into a piece of meat, 
It is possible to imagine the rest of the bird: 
Its head which like your fist 
Is large, bald, beakless and blind. 
 

Animal Acts

A bear who eats with a silver spoon. 
Two apes adept at grave-digging. 
Rats who do calculus. 
A police dog who copulates with a woman, 
Who takes undertaker's measurements.

A bedbug who suffers, who has doubts 
About his existence.  The miraculous 
Laughing dove.  A thousand-year-old turtle 
Playing billiards.  A chicken who 
Cuts his own throat, who bleeds.

The trainer with his sugar-cubes, 
With his chair and whip.  The evenings 
When they all huddle in a cage, 
Smoking cheap cigars, lazily 
Marking the cards in the new deck. 
 

Harsh Climate

The brain itself in its skull 
Is very cold, 
According to 
Albertus Magnus.

Something like a stretch of tundra 
On the scale of the universe. 
Galactic wind. 
Lofty icebergs in the distance.

Polar night. 
A large ocean liner caught in the ice. 
A few lights still burning on the deck. 
Silence and fierce cold. 
 

Bestiary for the Fingers of My Right Hand

1. 
Thumb, loose tooth of a horse. 
Rooster to his hens. 
Horn of a devil.  Fat worm 
They have attached to my flesh 
At the time of my birth. 
It takes four to hold him down, 
Bend him in half, until the bone 
Begins to whimper. 
Cut him off.  He can take care 
Of himself.  Take root in the earth, 
Or go hunting with wolves.

2. 
The second points the way. 
True way.  The path crosses the earth, 
The moon and some stars. 
Watch, he points further. 
He points to himself.

3. 
The middle one has backache. 
Stiff, still unaccustomed to this life: 
An old man at birth.  It's about something 
That he had and lost, 
That he looks for within my hand, 
The way a dog looks 
For fleas 
With a sharp tooth.

4. 
The fourth is mystery. 
Sometimes as my hand 
Rests on the table 
He jumps by himself 
As though someone called his name.

After each bone, finger, 
I come to him, troubled.

5. 
Something stirs in the fifth 
Something perpetually at the point 
Of birth.  Weak and submissive, 
His touch is gentle. 
It weighs a tear. 
It takes the mote out of the eye.


Riprap

Lay down these words
Before your mind like rocks.
             placed solid, by hands   
In choice of place, set
Before the body of the mind
             in space and time:
Solidity of bark, leaf, or wall
             riprap of things:
Cobble of milky way,
             straying planets,
These poems, people,
             lost ponies with
Dragging saddles—
             and rocky sure-foot trails.   
The worlds like an endless   
             four-dimensional
Game of Go.
             ants and pebbles
In the thin loam, each rock a word   
             a creek-washed stone
Granite: ingrained
             with torment of fire and weight   
Crystal and sediment linked hot
             all change, in thoughts,   
As well as things.
 

 

 

Above Pate Valley

We finished clearing the last   
Section of trail by noon,
High on the ridge-side
Two thousand feet above the creek   
Reached the pass, went on
Beyond the white pine groves,   
Granite shoulders, to a small
Green meadow watered by the snow,   
Edged with Aspen—sun
Straight high and blazing
But the air was cool.
Ate a cold fried trout in the   
Trembling shadows. I spied
A glitter, and found a flake
Black volcanic glass—obsidian—
By a flower. Hands and knees   
Pushing the Bear grass, thousands   
Of arrowhead leavings over a   
Hundred yards. Not one good   
Head, just razor flakes
On a hill snowed all but summer,   
A land of fat summer deer,
They came to camp. On their   
Own trails. I followed my own   
Trail here. Picked up the cold-drill,   
Pick, singlejack, and sack
Of dynamite.
Ten thousand years.
 

Mid-August at Sourdough Mountain Lookout

Down valley a smoke haze
Three days heat, after five days rain   
Pitch glows on the fir-cones
Across rocks and meadows
Swarms of new flies.
 
I cannot remember things I once read   
A few friends, but they are in cities.   
Drinking cold snow-water from a tin cup   
Looking down for miles
Through high still air.
 

 

How Poetry Comes to Me

It comes blundering over the
Boulders at night, it stays
Frightened outside the
Range of my campfire
I go to meet it at the
Edge of the light

For All

Ah to be alive
on a mid-September morn
fording a stream
barefoot, pants rolled up,
holding boots, pack on,
sunshine, ice in the shallows,
northern rockies.

Rustle and shimmer of icy creek waters
stones turn underfoot, small and hard as toes
cold nose dripping
singing inside
creek music, heart music,
smell of sun on gravel.

I pledge allegiance

I pledge allegiance to the soil
of Turtle Island,
and to the beings who thereon dwell
one ecosystem
in diversity
under the sun
With joyful interpenetration for all.

On Top

All this new stuff goes on top
turn it over, turn it over
wait and water down
from the dark bottom
turn it inside out
let it spread through
Sift down even.
Watch it sprout.

A mind like compost.

Hay for the Horses

He had driven half the night
From far down San Joaquin
Through Mariposa, up the
Dangerous Mountain roads,
And pulled in at eight a.m.
With his big truckload of hay
            behind the barn.
With winch and ropes and hooks
We stacked the bales up clean
To splintery redwood rafters
High in the dark, flecks of alfalfa
Whirling through shingle-cracks of light,
Itch of haydust in the 
            sweaty shirt and shoes.
At lunchtime under Black oak
Out in the hot corral,
---The old mare nosing lunchpails,
Grasshoppers crackling in the weeds---
"I'm sixty-eight" he said,
"I first bucked hay when I was seventeen.
I thought, that day I started,
I sure would hate to do this all my life.
And dammit, that's just what
I've gone and done."

Old Bones

Out there walking round, looking out for food,
a rootstock, a birdcall, a seed that you can crack
plucking, digging, snaring, snagging,
        barely getting by, 

no food out there on dusty slopes of scree—
carry some—look for some,
go for a hungry dream.
Deer bone, Dall sheep,
        bones hunger home. 

Out there somewhere
a shrine for the old ones,
the dust of the old bones,
        old songs and tales. 

What we ate—who ate what—
        how we all prevailed.

Kisiabaton

Beat-up datsun idling in the road
shreds of fog
almost-vertical hillsides drop away
huge stumps fading into mist
soft warm rain

Snaggy, forked and spreading tops, a temperate cloud-forest tree

Chamaecyparis formosiana--
Taiwan hinoki,
hung-kuai     red cypress

That the tribal people call kisiabaton

this rare old tree
is what we came to see.

At Tower Peak

Every tan rolling meadow will turn into housing
Freeways are clogged all day
Academies packed with scholars writing papers
City people lean and dark
This land most real 
As its western-tending golden slopes
And bird-entangled central valley swamps
Sea-lion, urchin coasts
Southerly salmon-probes 
Into the aromatic almost-Mexican hills
Along a range of granite peaks
The names forgotten,
An eastward running river that ends out in desert
The chipping ground-squirrels in the tumbled blocks
The gloss of glacier ghost on slab
Where we wake refreshed from ten hours sleep
After a long day's walking
Packing burdens to the snow
Wake to the same old world of no names,
No things, new as ever, rock and water,
Cool dawn birdcalls, high jet contrails.
A day or two or million, breathing
A few steps back from what goes down
In the current realm.
A kind of ice age, spreading, filling valleys
Shaving soils, paving fields, you can walk in it
Live in it, drive through it then 
It melts away
For whatever sprouts
After the age of
Frozen hearts. Flesh-carved rock
And gusts on the summit,
Smoke from forest fires is white,
The haze above the distant valley like a dusk.
It's just one world, this spine of rock and streams
And snow, and the wash of gravels, silts
Sands, bunchgrasses, saltbrush, bee-fields,
Twenty million human people, downstream, here below.

Smokey the Bear Sutra

Once in the Jurassic about 150 million years ago,
the Great Sun Buddha in this corner of the Infinite
Void gave a Discourse to all the assembled elements
and energies: to the standing beings, the walking beings,
the flying beings, and the sitting beings -- even grasses,
to the number of thirteen billion, each one born from a
seed, assembled there: a Discourse concerning
Enlightenment on the planet Earth. 

"In some future time, there will be a continent called
America. It will have great centers of power called
such as Pyramid Lake, Walden Pond, Mt. Rainier, Big Sur,
Everglades, and so forth; and powerful nerves and channels
such as Columbia River, Mississippi River, and Grand Canyon
The human race in that era will get into troubles all over
its head, and practically wreck everything in spite of
its own strong intelligent Buddha-nature." 

"The twisting strata of the great mountains and the pulsings
of volcanoes are my love burning deep in the earth.
My obstinate compassion is schist and basalt and
granite, to be mountains, to bring down the rain. In that
future American Era I shall enter a new form; to cure
the world of loveless knowledge that seeks with blind hunger:
and mindless rage eating food that will not fill it." 

And he showed himself in his true form of

SMOKEY THE BEAR

·        A handsome smokey-colored brown bear standing on his hind legs, showing that he is aroused and
watchful.

·        Bearing in his right paw the Shovel that digs to the truth beneath appearances; cuts the roots of useless
attachments, and flings damp sand on the fires of greed and war;

·        His left paw in the Mudra of Comradely Display -- indicating that all creatures have the full right to live to their limits and that deer, rabbits, chipmunks, snakes, dandelions, and lizards all grow in the realm of the Dharma;

·        Wearing the blue work overalls symbolic of slaves and laborers, the countless men oppressed by a
civilization that claims to save but often destroys;

·        Wearing the broad-brimmed hat of the West, symbolic of the forces that guard the Wilderness, which is the Natural State of the Dharma and the True Path of man on earth: all true paths lead through mountains --

·        With a halo of smoke and flame behind, the forest fires of the kali-yuga, fires caused by the stupidity of
those who think things can be gained and lost whereas in truth all is contained vast and free in the Blue Sky and Green Earth of One Mind;

·        Round-bellied to show his kind nature and that the great earth has food enough for everyone who loves her and trusts her;

·        Trampling underfoot wasteful freeways and needless suburbs; smashing the worms of capitalism and
totalitarianism;

·        Indicating the Task: his followers, becoming free of cars, houses, canned foods, universities, and shoes;
master the Three Mysteries of their own Body, Speech, and Mind; and fearlessly chop down the rotten
trees and prune out the sick limbs of this country America and then burn the leftover trash.

Wrathful but Calm. Austere but Comic. Smokey the Bear will
Illuminate those who would help him; but for those who would hinder or
slander him,

HE WILL PUT THEM OUT.

Thus his great Mantra:

Namah samanta vajranam chanda maharoshana
Sphataya hum traka ham nam

"I DEDICATE MYSELF TO THE UNIVERSAL DIAMOND
BE THIS RAGING FURY DESTROYED"

And he will protect those who love woods and rivers,
Gods and animals, hobos and madmen, prisoners and sick
people, musicians, playful women, and hopeful children: 

And if anyone is threatened by advertising, air pollution, television,
or the police, they should chant SMOKEY THE BEAR'S WAR SPELL:

DROWN THEIR BUTTS
CRUSH THEIR BUTTS
DROWN THEIR BUTTS
CRUSH THEIR BUTTS

And SMOKEY THE BEAR will surely appear to put the enemy out
with his vajra-shovel.

·        Now those who recite this Sutra and then try to put it in practice will accumulate merit as countless as the sands of Arizona and Nevada.

·        Will help save the planet Earth from total oil slick.

·        Will enter the age of harmony of man and nature.

·        Will win the tender love and caresses of men, women, and beasts.

·        Will always have ripe blackberries to eat and a sunny spot under a pine tree to sit at.

·        AND IN THE END WILL WIN HIGHEST PERFECT ENLIGHTENMENT. 

thus have we heard.

Ellen West 
I love sweets,—
                              heaven
would be dying on a bed of vanilla ice cream . . .
 
But my true self
is thin, all profile
 
and effortless gestures, the sort of blond
elegant girl whose
                                body is the image of her soul.
 
—My doctors tell me I must give up
this ideal;
                 but I
WILL NOT . . . cannot.
 
Only to my husband I'm not simply a "case."
 
But he is a fool. He married
meat, and thought it was a wife.
 
* * *
 
Why am I a girl?
 
I ask my doctors, and they tell me they
don't know, that it is just "given."
 
But it has such
implications—;
                            and sometimes,
I even feel like a girl.
 
* * *
 
Now, at the beginning of Ellen's thirty-second year, her
physical condition has deteriorated still further. Her use
of laxatives increases beyond measure. Every evening she
takes sixty to seventy tablets of a laxative, with the result
that she suffers tortured vomiting at night and violent
diarrhea by day, often accompanied by a weakness of the
heart. She has thinned down to a skeleton, and weighs
only 92 pounds.

About five years ago, I was in a restaurant,
eating alone
                           with a book. I was
not married, and often did that . . .
 
—I'd turn down
dinner invitations, so I could eat alone;
 
I'd allow myself two pieces of bread, with
butter, at the beginning, and three scoops of
vanilla ice cream, at the end,—
 
                                                     sitting there alone
 
with a book, both in the book
and out of it, waited on, idly
watching people,—
 
                                    when an attractive young man
and woman, both elegantly dressed,
sat next to me.
 
                            She was beautiful—;
 
with sharp, clear features, a good
bone structure—;
                               if she took her make-up off
in front of you, rubbing cold cream
again and again across her skin, she still would be
beautiful—
                   more beautiful.
 
And he,—
                   I couldn't remember when I had seen a man
so attractive. I didn't know why. He was almost
 
a male version
                             of her,—
 
I had the sudden, mad notion that I
wanted to be his lover . . .
 
—Were they married?
                                      were they lovers?
 
They didn't wear wedding rings.
 
Their behavior was circumspect. They discussed
politics. They didn't touch . . .
 
—How could I discover?
 
                                                Then, when the first course
arrived, I noticed the way
 
each held his fork out for the other
 
to taste what he had ordered . . .
 
                                                                 They did this
again and again, with pleased looks, indulgent
smiles, for each course,
                                     more than once for each dish—;
much too much for just friends . . .
 
—Their behavior somehow sickened me;
 
the way each gladly
put the food the other had offered into his mouth—;
 
I knew what they were. I knew they slept together.
 
An immense depression came over me . . .
 
—I knew I could never
with such ease allow another to put food into my mouth:
 
happily myself put food into another's mouth—;
 
I knew that to become a wife I would have to give up my ideal.
 
* * *
 
Even as a child,
I saw that the "natural" process of aging
 
is for one's middle to thicken—
one's skin to blotch;
 
as happened to my mother.
And her mother.
                            I loathed "Nature."
 
At twelve, pancakes
became the most terrible thought there is. . .
 
I shall defeat "Nature."
 
In the hospital, when they
weigh me, I wear weights secretly sewn into my belt.

January 16. The patient is allowed to eat in her room, but comes
readily with her husband to afternoon coffee. Previously she had
stoutly resisted this on the ground that she did not really eat but
devoured like a wild animal. This she demonstrated with utmost
realism . . . . Her physical examination showed nothing striking.
Salivary-glands are markedly enlarged on both sides.
January 21. Has been reading Faust again. In her diary,
writes that art is the "mutual permeation" of the "world of the
body" and the "world of the spirit." Says that her own poems
are "hospital poems . . . weak—without skill or perseverance;
only managing to beat their wings softly."
February 8. Agitation, quickly subsided again. Has
attached herself to an elegant, very thin female patient. Homo-
erotic component strikingly evident.
February 15. Vexation, and torment. Says that her mind
forces her always to think of eating. Feels herself degraded by
this. Has entirely, for the first time in years, stopped writing poetry.

Callas is my favorite singer, but I've only
seen her once—;
 
I've never forgotten that night. . .
 
—It was in Tosca, she had long before
lost weight, her voice
had been, for years,
                                  deteriorating, half itself. . .
 
When her career began, of course, she was fat,
 
enormous—; in the early photographs,
sometimes I almost don't recognize her. . .
 
The voice too then was enormous—
 
healthy; robust; subtle; but capable of
crude effects, even vulgar,
                                             almost out of
high spirits, too much health. . .
 
But soon she felt that she must lose weight,—
that all she was trying to express
 
was obliterated by her body,
buried in flesh—;
                               abruptly, within
four months, she lost at least sixty pounds. . .
 
—The gossip in Milan was that Callas
had swallowed a tapeworm.
 
But of course she hadn't.
 
                                            The tapeworm
was her soul. . .
 
—How her soul, uncompromising,
insatiable,
                    must have loved eating the flesh from her bones,
 
revealing this extraordinarily
mercurial; fragile; masterly creature. . .
 
—But irresistibly, nothing
stopped there; the huge voice
 
also began to change: at first, it simply diminished
in volume, in size,
                                  then the top notes became
shrill, unreliable—at last,
usually not there at all. . .
 
—No one knows why. Perhaps her mind,
ravenous, still insatiable, sensed
 
that to struggle with the shreds of a voice
 
must make her artistry subtler, more refined,
more capable of expressing humiliation,
rage, betrayal. . .
 
—Perhaps the opposite. Perhaps her spirit
loathed the unending struggle
 
to embody itself, to manifest itself, on a stage whose
 
mechanics, and suffocating customs,
seemed expressly designed to annihilate spirit. . .
 
—I know that in Tosca, in the second act,
when, humiliated, hounded by Scarpia,
she sang Vissi d'arte
                                      —"I lived for art"—
 
and in torment, bewilderment, at the end she asks,
with a voice reaching
                                      harrowingly for the notes,
 
"Art has repaid me LIKE THIS?"
 
                                                           I felt I was watching
autobiography—
                              an art; skill;
virtuosity
 
miles distant from the usual soprano's
athleticism,—
                         the usual musician's dream
of virtuosity without content. . .
 
—I wonder what she feels, now,
listening to her recordings.
 
For they have already, within a few years,
begun to date. . .
 
Whatever they express
they express through the style of a decade
and a half—;
                         a style she helped create. . .
 
—She must know that now
she probably would not do a trill in
exactly that way,—
                                   that the whole sound, atmosphere,
dramaturgy of her recordings
 
have just slightly become those of the past. . .
 
—Is it bitter? Does her soul
tell her
 
that she was an idiot ever to think
anything
                material wholly could satisfy?. . .
 
—Perhaps it says: The only way
to escape
the History of Styles
 
is not to have a body.
 
* * *
 
When I open my eyes in the morning, my great
mystery
             stands before me . . .
 
—I know that I am intelligent; therefore
 
the inability not to fear food
day-and-night; this unending hunger
ten minutes after I have eaten . . .
                                                          a childish
dread of eating; hunger which can have no cause,—
 
half my mind says that all this
is demeaning . . .
 
                                 Bread
 
for days on end
drives all real thought from my brain . . .
 
—Then I think, No. The ideal of being thin
 
conceals the ideal
not to have a body—;
                                     which is NOT trivial . . .
 
This wish seems now as much a "given" of my existence
 
as the intolerable
fact that I am dark-complexioned; big-boned;
and once weighed
one hundred and sixty-five pounds . . .
 
—But then I think, No. That's too simple,—
 
without a body, who can
know himself at all?
                                   Only by
acting; choosing; rejecting; have I
made myself—
                         discovered who and what Ellen can be . . .
 
—But then again I think, NO. This I is anterior
 
to name; gender; action;
fashion;
                MATTER ITSELF,—
 
. . . trying to stop my hunger with FOOD
is like trying to appease thirst
                                                   with ink.

March 30. Result of the consultation: Both gentlemen agree
completely with my prognosis and doubt any therapeutic
usefulness of commitment even more emphatically than I.
All three of us are agreed that it is not a case of obsessional
neurosis and not one of manic-depressive psychosis, and that
no definitely reliable therapy is possible. We therefore resolved
to give in to the patient's demand for discharge.

The train-ride yesterday
was far worse than I expected . . .
 
                                                         In our compartment
 
were ordinary people: a student;
a woman; her child;—
 
they had ordinary bodies, pleasant faces;
                                                                            but I thought
 
I was surrounded by creatures
 
with the pathetic, desperate
desire to be not what they were:—
 
the student was short,
and carried his body as if forcing
it to be taller—;
 
the woman showed her gums when she smiled,
and often held her
hand up to hide them—;
 
the child
seemed to cry simply because it was
small; a dwarf, and helpless . . .
 
—I was hungry. I had insisted that my husband
not bring food . . .
 
After about thirty minutes, the woman
peeled an orange
 
to quiet the child. She put a section
into its mouth—;
                               immediately it spit it out.
 
The piece fell to the floor.
 
—She pushed it with her foot through the dirt
toward me
several inches.
 
My husband saw me staring
down at the piece . . .
 
—I didn't move; how I wanted
to reach out,
                        and as if invisible
 
shove it in my mouth—;
 
my body
became rigid. As I stared at him,
I could see him staring
 
at me,—
                then he looked at the student—; at the woman—; then
back to me . . .
 
I didn't move.
 
—At last, he bent down, and
casually
               threw it out the window.
 
He looked away.
 
—I got up to leave the compartment, then
saw his face,—
 
his eyes
were red;
                and I saw
 
—I'm sure I saw—
 
disappointment.
 
* * *
 
At breakfast she eats butter and sugar, at noon she eats
so much that—for the first time in thirteen years!—she is
satisfied by her food and gets really full. At afternoon
coffee she eats chocolate creams and Easter eggs. She
takes a walk with her husband, reads poems, listens to
recordings, is in a positively festive mood, and all heavi-
ness seems to have fallen away from her. She writes
letters, the last one a letter to the fellow patient here to
whom she had become so attached. In the evening she
takes a lethal dose of poison, and on the following morn-
ing she is dead. "She looked as she had never looked in
life—calm and happy and peaceful."
 
* * *
 
Dearest.—I remember how
at eighteen,
                     on hikes with friends, when
they rested, sitting down to joke or talk,
 
I circled
around them, afraid to hike ahead alone,
 
yet afraid to rest
when I was not yet truly thin.
 
You and, yes, my husband,—
you and he
 
have by degrees drawn me within the circle;
forced me to sit down at last on the ground.
 
I am grateful.
 
But something in me refuses it.
 
—How eager I have been
to compromise, to kill this refuser,—
 
but each compromise, each attempt
to poison an ideal
which often seemed to me sterile and unreal,
 
heightens my hunger.
 
I am crippled. I disappoint you.
 
Will you greet with anger, or
happiness,
 
the news which might well reach you
before this letter?
 
Your Ellen.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Herbert White 
"When I hit her on the head, it was good,

and then I did it to her a couple of times,--
but it was funny,--afterwards,
it was as if somebody else did it ...

Everything flat, without sharpness, richness or line.

Still, I liked to drive past the woods where she lay,
tell the old lady and the kids I had to take a piss,
hop out and do it to her ...

The whole buggy of them waiting for me
made me feel good;
but still, just like I knew all along,
she didn't move.

When the body got too discomposed,
I'd just jack off, letting it fall on her ...

--It sounds crazy, but I tell you
sometimes it was beautiful--; I don't know how
to say it, but for a minute, everything was possible--;
and then,
then,--
well, like I said, she didn't move: and I saw,
under me, a little girl was just lying there in the mud:

and I knew I couldn't have done that,--
somebody else had to have done that,--
standing above her there,
in those ordinary, shitty leaves ...

--One time, I went to see Dad in a motel where he was
staying with a woman; but she was gone;
you could smell the wine in the air; and he started,
real embarrassing, to cry ...
He was still a little drunk,
and asked me to forgive him for
all he hasn't done--; but, What the shit?
Who would have wanted to stay with Mom? with bastards
not even his own kids?

I got in the truck, and started to drive
and saw a little girl--
who I picked up, hit on the head, and
screwed, and screwed, and screwed, and screwed, then

buried,
in the garden of the motel ...

--You see, ever since I was a kid I wanted
to feel things make sense: I remember

looking out the window of my room back home,--
and being almost suffocated by the asphalt;
and grass; and trees; and glass;
just there, just there, doing nothing!
not saying anything! filling me up--
but also being a wall; dead, and stopping me;
--how I wanted to see beneath it, cut

beneath it, and make it
somehow, come alive ...

The salt of the earth;
Mom once said, 'Man's spunk is the salt of the earth ...'

--That night, at that Twenty-nine Palms Motel
I had passed a million times on the road, everything

fit together; was alright;
it seemed like
everything had to be there, like I had spent years
trying, and at last finally finished drawing this
huge circle ...

--But then, suddenly I knew
somebody else did it, some bastard
had hurt a little girl--; the motel
I could see again, it had been
itself all the time, a lousy
pile of bricks, plaster, that didn't seem to
have to be there,--but was, just by chance ...

--Once, on the farm, when I was a kid,
I was screwing a goat; and the rope around his neck
when he tried to get away
pulled tight;--and just when I came,
he died ...
I came back the next day; jacked off over his body;
but it didn't do any good ...

Mom once said:
'Man's spunk is the salt of the earth, and grows kids.'

I tried so hard to come; more pain than anything else;
but didn't do any good ...

--About six months ago, I heard Dad remarried,
so I drove over to Connecticut to see him and see
if he was happy.
She was twenty-five years younger than him:
she had lots of little kids, and I don't know why,
I felt shaky ...

I stopped in front of the address; and
snuck up to the window to look in ...
--There he was, a kid
six months old on his lap, laughing
and bouncing the kid, happy in his old age
to play the papa after years of sleeping around,--
it twisted me up ...
To think that what he wouldn't give me,
he wanted to give them ...

I could have killed the bastard ...

--Naturally, I just got right back in the car,
and believe me, was determined, determined,
to head straight for home ...

but the more I drove,
I kept thinking about getting a girl,
and the more I thought I shouldn't do it,
the more I had to--

I saw her coming out of the movies,
saw she was alone, and
kept circling the blocks as she walked along them,
saying, 'You're going to leave her alone.'
'You're going to leave her alone.'

--The woods were scary!
As the seasons changed, and you saw more and more
of the skull show through, the nights became clearer,
and the buds,--erect, like nipples ...

--But then, one night,
nothing worked ...
Nothing in the sky
would blur like I wanted it to;
and I couldn't, couldn't,
get it to seem to me
that somebody else did it ...

I tried, and tried, but there was just me there,
and her, and the sharp trees
saying, "That's you standing there.
You're ...
just you."

I hope I fry.

--Hell came when I saw
MYSELF ...
and couldn't stand
what I see ..." 


The Wounded Breakfast

    A huge shoe mounts up from the horizon, squealing and grinding forward on small wheels, even as a man sitting to breakfast on his veranda is suddenly engulfed in a great shadow almost the size of the night. 
    He looks up and sees a huge shoe ponderously mounting out of the earth.  Up in the unlaced ankle-part an old woman stands at a helm behind the great tongue curled forward; the thick laces dragging like ships' rope on the ground as the huge thing squeals and grinds forward; children everywhere, they look from the shoelace holes, they crowd about the old woman, even as she pilots this huge shoe over the earth. . . 
    Soon the huge shoe is descending the opposite horizon, a monstrous snail squealing and grinding into the earth. . . 
    The man turns to his breakfast again, but sees it's been wounded, the yolk of one of his eggs is bleeding. . . 
  
 

The Automobile

A man had just married an automobile.

    But I mean to say, said his father, that the automobile is not a person because it is something different.

    For instance, compare it to your mother.  Do you see how it is different from your mother?  Somehow it seems wider, doesn't it?  And besides, your mother wears her hair differently.

    You ought to try to find something in the world that looks like mother.

    I have mother, isn't that enough that looks like mother?  Do I have to gather more mothers?

    They are all old ladies who do not in the least excite any wish to procreate, said the son.

    But you cannot procreate with an automobile, said father.

    The son shows father an ignition key.  See, here is a special penis which does with the automobile as the man with the woman; and the automobile gives birth to a place far from this place, dropping its puppy miles as it goes.

    Does that make me a grandfather? said father.

    That makes you where you are when I am far away, said the son.

    Father and mother watch an automobile with a just married sign on it growing smaller in a road. 
  
  
  
 

The Fall 
 

    There was a man who found two leaves and came indoors holding them out saying to his parents that he was a tree.

    To which they said then go into the yard and do not grow in the living-room as your roots may ruin the carpet.

    He said I was fooling I am not a tree and he dropped his leaves.

    But his parents said look it is fall. 
  
  
 

A Cottage in the Wood 
 

    He has built himself a cottage in a wood, near where the insect rubs its wings in song. 
    Yet, without measure, or proper sense of scale, he has made the cottage too small.  He realizes this when only his hand will fit through the door.  He tries the stairs to the second floor with his fingers, but his arm wedges in the entrance.  He wonders how he will cook his dinner.  He might get his hands through the kitchen window.  But even so, he will not be able to cook enough on such a tiny stove. 
    He shall also lie unsheltered in the night, even though a bed with its covers turned down waits for him in the cottage. 
    He lies down and curls himself around the cottage, listening to the insect that rubs its wings in song. 
  
  
 

The Broken Daughter 
 

    His daughter had broken.  He took her to be repaired. . .If you'll just pump-up her backside, and rewire her hair. . .

    This girl needs a whole new set of valves, and look at all those collision marks around her face, said the mechanic.

    I just want her fixed-up enough to use around the house; for longer trips I have my wife. 
  
  
 

Cinderella's Life at the Castle 
 

    After Cinderella married the prince she turned her attention to minutiae, using her glass slipper as a magnifying lens. 
    When at court she would wear orange peels and fish tins, and other decorous rubbish as found in back of the castle.

    You are making me very nervous, said the prince. 
    But Cinderella continued to look at something through her glass slipper. 
    Did you hear me? said the prince. 
    Cinderella's mouth hung open as she continued to look at something through her glass slipper. 
    Did you hear me, did you hear me, did you hear me? screamed the prince. 
  
 

A Journey Through the Moonlight

    In sleep when an old man's body is no longer aware of its boundaries, and lies flattened by gravity like a mere of wax in its bed. . .It drips down to the floor and moves there like a tear down a cheek. . .Under the back door  into the silver meadow, like a pool of sperm, frosty under the moon, as if in his first nature, boneless and absurd.

    The moon lifts him up into its white field, a cloud shaped like an old man, porous with stars. 
    He floats through high dark branches, a corpse tangled in a tree on a river. 
 

Summer, Forty Years Later

    He struggles out of a closet where his mother had hung him forty years ago. 
    She didn't understand children; she probably thought he was something made of cloth. 
    He thinks he as waited long enough for her to understand children, even though he is no longer a child. 
    After forty years a man has a right to seek the hallway; after all, he might even hope for the front door--and who knows, perhaps even a Nobel Prize for patience!

    From the front porch he sees that the midday sky is darker than he remembered it; the green of the lawn and trees has also darkened:  too many nights, too many coats of varnish. . . . 
    This is not the same summer, the color is gone. . .

    . . . That little boy who is always passing the house with his wagon has turned into a little old man collecting garbage. . . 
  

  Poems by Ai 
  
 
Cuba, 1962 
 

When the rooster jumps up on the windowsill 
and spreads his red-gold wings, 
I wake, thinking it is the sun 
and call Juanita, hearing her answer, 
but only in my mind. 
I know she is already outside, 
breaking the cane off at ground level, 
using only her big hands. 
I get the machete and walk among the cane, 
until I see her, lying face-down in the dirt.

Juanita, dead in the morning like this. 
I raise the machete—
what I take from the earth, I give back—
and cut off her feet. 
I lift the body and carry it to the wagon, 
where I load the cane to sell in the village. 
Whoever tastes my woman in his candy, his cake, 
tastes something sweeter than this sugar cane; 
it is grief. 
If you eat too much of it, you want more, 
you can never get enough. 
 


The Anniversary 
 

You raise the ax, 
the block of wood screams in half, 
while I lift the sack of flour 
and carry it into the house. 
I'm not afraid of the blade 
you've just pointed at my head. 
If I were dead, you could take the boy, 
hunt, kiss gnats, instead of my moist lips. 
Take it easy, squabs are roasting, 
corn, still in husks, crackles, 
as the boy dances around the table: 
old guest at a wedding party for two sad-faced clowns, 
who together, never won a round of anything but hard times. 
Come in, sheets are clean, 
fall down on me for one more year 
and we can blast another hole in ourselves without a sound. 
 

The Country Midwife:  A Day 
 

I bend over the woman. 
This is the third time between abortions. 
I dip a towel into a bucket of hot water 
and catch the first bit of blood, 
as the blue-pink dome of a head breaks through. 
A scraggy, red child comes out of her into my hands 
like warehouse ice sliding down a chute.

It's done, the stink of birth, Old Grizzly 
rears up on his hind legs in front of me 
and I want to go outside, 
but the air smells the same there too. 
The woman's left eye twitches 
and beneath her, a stain as orange as sunrise 
spreads over the sheet. 
I lift my short, blunt fingers to my face 
and I let her bleed, Lord, I let her bleed. 
  
The Hitchhiker

The Arizona wind dries out my nostrils 
and the heat of the sidewalk burns my shoes, 
as a woman drives up slowly. 
I get in, grinning at a face I do not like, 
but I slide my arm across the top of the seat 
and rest it lightly against her shoulder. 
We turn off into the desert, 
then I reach inside my pocket and touch the switchblade.

We stop, and as she moves closer to me, my hands ache, 
but somehow, I get the blade into her chest. 
I think a song:  "Everybody needs somebody, 
everybody needs somebody to love," 
as the black numerals 35 roll out of her right eye 
inside one small tear. 
Laughing, I snap my fingers.  Rape, murder, I got you 
in the sight of my gun.

I move off toward the street. 
My feet press down in it, 
familiar with the hot, soft asphalt 
that caresses them. 
The sun slips down into its cradle behind the mountains 
and it is hot, hotter than ever 
and I like it. 
  
 

The Root Eater 
 

The war has begun 
and I see the Root Eater bending, 
shifting his hands under the soil 
in search of the arthritic knuckles of trees. 
I see dazed flower stems 
pushing themselves back into the ground. 
I see turnips spinning endlessly 
on the blunt, bitten-off tips of their noses. 
I see the Root Eater going home on his knees, 
full of the ripe foundations of things, 
longing to send his seed up through his feet 
and out into the morning

but the stumps of trees heave themselves forward 
for the last march 
and the Root Eater waits, 
knowing he will be shoved, rootless, 
under the brown, scaly torso of the rock. 
  
  
 

Everything:  Eloy, Arizona, 1956 
 

Tin shack, where my baby sleeps on his back 
the way the hound taught him; 
highway, black zebra, with one white stripe; 
nickel in my pocket for chewing gum; 
you think you're all I've got. 
But when the 2 ton rolls to a stop 
and the driver gets out, 
I sit down in the shade and wave each finger, 
saving my whole hand till the last.

He's keys, tires, a fire lit in his belly 
in the diner up the road. 
I'm red toenails, tight blue halter, black slip. 
He's mine tonight.  I don't know him. 
He can only hurt me a piece at a time.

After a Long Time

the halves of the egg, impotence, 
slide into each other on waxed feet 
and the wait is over. 
The seam between my legs 
basted with hair tears apart, 
as your blue, flannel spoon slips inside, 
digs out the pieces of cracked shell 
and lays them on my thighs, 
like old china plates made too thin 
for holding anything but love.

To a Blossoming Pear Tree 
 

Beautiful natural blossoms, 
Pure delicate body, 
You stand without trembling. 
Little mist of fallen starlight, 
Perfect, beyond my reach, 
How I envy you. 
For if you could only listen, 
I would tell you something, 
Something human.

An old man 
Appeared to me once 
In the unendurable snow. 
He had a singe of white 
Beard on his face. 
He paused on a street in Minneapolis 
And stroked my face. 
Give it to me, he begged. 
I'll pay you anything.

I flinched.  Both terrified, 
We slunk away, 
Each in his own way dodging 
The cruel darts of the cold.

Beautiful natural blossoms, 
How could you possibly 
Worry or bother or care 
About the ashamed, hopeless 
Old man?  He was so near death 
He was willing to take 
Any love he could get, 
Even at the risk 
Of some mocking policeman 
Or some cute young wiseacre 
Smashing his dentures, 
Perhaps leading him on 
To a dark place and there 
Kicking him in his dead groin 
Just for the fun of it.

Young tree, unburdened 
By anything but your beautiful natural blossoms 
And dew, the dark 
Blood in my body drags me 
Down with my brother. 
  
Northern Pike 
 

All right.  Try this, 
Then.  Every body 
I know and care for, 
And every body 
Else is going 
To die in a loneliness 
I can't imagine and a pain 
I don't know.  We had 
To go on living.  We 
Untangled the net, we slit 
The body of this fish 
Open from the hinge of the tail 
To a place beneath the chin 
I wish I could sing of. 
I would just as soon we let 
The living go on living. 
An old poet whom we believe in 
Said the same thing, and so 
We paused among the dark cattails and prayed 
For the muskrats, 
For the ripples below their tails, 
For the little movements that we knew the crawdads were making under water, 
For the right-hand wrist of my cousin who is a policeman 
We prayed for the game warden's blindness. 
We prayed for the road home. 
We ate the fish. 
There must be something very beautiful in my body, 
I am so happy. 
  
  
A Blessing

Just off the highway to Rochester, Minnesota, 
Twilight bounds softly forth on the grass. 
And the eyes of those two Indian ponies 
Darken with kindness. 
They have come gladly out of the willows 
To welcome my friend and me. 
We step over the barbed wire into the pasture 
Where they have been grazing all day, alone. 
They ripple tensely, they can hardly contain their happiness 
That we have come. 
They bow shyly as wet swans.  They love each other. 
There is no loneliness like theirs. 
At home once more, they begin munching the young tufts of spring in the darkness. 
I would like to hold the slenderer one in my arms, 
For she has walked over to me 
And nuzzled my left hand. 
She is black and white, 
Her mane falls wild on her forehead, 
And the light breeze moves me to caress her long ear 
That is delicate as the skin over a girl's wrist. 
Suddenly I realize 
That if I stepped out of my body I would break 
Into blossom. 
  

Autumn Begins in Martins Ferry, Ohio

In the Shreve High football stadium, 
I think of Polacks nursing long beers in Tiltonsville, 
And gray faces of Negroes in the blast furnace at Benwood, 
And the ruptured night watchman of Wheeling Steel, 
Dreaming of heroes.

All the proud fathers are ashamed to go home. 
Their women cluck like starved pullets, 
Dying for love.

Therefore, 
Their sons grow suicidally beautiful 
At the beginning of October, 
And gallop terribly against each other's bodies. 
  
  
The Jewel

There is this cave 
In the air behind my body 
That nobody is going to touch: 
A cloister, a silence 
Closing around a blossom of fire. 
When I stand upright in the wind, 
My bones turn to dark emeralds. 
  
  
Lying in a Hammock at William Duffy's Farm in Pine Island, Minnesota 
 

Over my head, I see the bronze butterfly, 
Asleep on the black trunk, 
blowing like a leaf in green shadow. 
Down the ravine behind the empty house, 
The cowbells follow one another 
Into the distances of the afternoon. 
To my right, 
In a field of sunlight between two pines, 
The droppings of last year's horses 
Blaze up into golden stones. 
I lean back, as the evening darkens and comes on. 
A chicken hawk floats over, looking for home. 
I have wasted my life. 
  
  
Outside Fargo, North Dakota

Along the sprawled body of the derailed Great Northern freight car, 
I strike a match slowly and lift it slowly. 
No wind.

Beyond town, three heavy white horses 
Wade all the way to their shoulders 
In a silo shadow.

Suddenly the freight car lurches. 
The door slams back, a man with a flashlight 
Calls me good evening. 
I nod as I write good evening, lonely 
And sick for home. 
  

A Poem about George Doty in the Death House

Lured by the wall, and drawn 
To stare below the roof, 
Where pigeons nest aloof 
From prowling cats and men, 
I count the sash and bar 
Secured to granite stone, 
And note the daylight gone, 
Supper and silence near.

Close to the wall inside, 
Immured, empty of love, 
A man I have wondered of 
Lies patient, vacant-eye. 
A month and a day ago 
He stopped his car and found 
A girl on the darkening ground, 
And killed her in the snow.

Beside his cell, I am told, 
Hardy perennial bums 
Complain till twilight comes 
For hunger and for cold. 
They hardly know of a day 
That saw their hunger pass. 
Bred to the dark, their flesh 
Peacefully withers away.

The man who sits alone, 
He is the one for wonder, 
Who sways his fingers under 
The cleanly shaven chin, 
Who sees, in the shaving mirror 
Pinned to the barren wall, 
The uprooted ghost of all: 
The simple, easy terror.

Caught between sky and earth, 
Poor stupid animal, 
Stripped naked to the wall, 
He saw the blundered birth 
Of daemons beyond sound. 
Sick of the dark, he rose 
For love, and now he goes 
Back to the broken ground.

Now, as he grips the chain 
And holds the wall, to bear 
What no man ever bore, 
He hears the bums complain; 
But I mourn no soul but his, 
Not even the bums who die, 
Nor the homely girl whose cry 
Crumbled his pleading kiss. 
 



At the Executed Murderer's Grave

Why should we do this?  What good is it to us?  Above all, how can we do such a thing?  How can it possibly be done? 
--Freud

1. 
My name is James A. Wright, and I was born 
Twenty-five miles from this infected grave, 
In Martins Ferry, Ohio, where one slave 
To Hazel-Atlas Glass became my father. 
He tried to teach me kindness.  I return 
Only in memory now, aloof, unhurried, 
To dead Ohio, where I might lie buried, 
Had I not run away before my time. 
Ohio caught George Doty.  Clean as lime, 
His skull rots empty here.  Dying's the best 
Of all the arts men learn in a dead place. 
I walked here once.  I made my loud display, 
Leaning for language on a dead man's voice. 
Now sick of lies, I turn to face the past. 
I add my easy grievance to the rest:

2. 
Doty, if I confess I do not love you, 
Will you let me alone?  I burn for my own lies. 
The nights electrocute my fugitive, 
My mind.  I run like the bewildered mad 
At St. Clair Sanitarium, who lurk, 
Arch and cunning, under the maple trees, 
Pleased to be playing guilty after dark. 
Staring to bed, they croon self-lullabies. 
Doty, you make me sick.  I am not dead. 
I croon my tears at fifty cents per line.

3. 
Idiot, he demanded love from girls, 
And murdered one.  Also, he was a thief. 
He left two women, and a ghost with child. 
The hair, foul as a dog's upon his head, 
Made such revolting Ohio animals 
Fitter for vomit than a kind man's grief. 
I waste no pity on the dead that stink, 
And no love's lost between me and the crying 
Drunks of Belaire, Ohio, where police 
Kick at their kidneys till they die of drink. 
Christ may restore them whole, for all of me. 
Alive and dead, those giggling muckers who 
Saddled my nighmares thirty years ago 
Can do without my widely printed sighing. 
Over their pains with paid sincerity. 
I do not pity the dead, I pity the dying.

4. 
I pity myself, because a man is dead. 
If Belmont County killed him, what of me? 
His victims never loved him.  Why should we? 
And yet, nobody had to kill him either. 
It does no good to woo the grass, to veil 
The quicklime hole of a man's defeat and shame. 
Nature-lovers are gone.  To hell with them. 
I kick the clods away, and speak my name.

5. 
This grave's gash festers.  Maybe it will heal, 
When all are caught with what they had to do 
In fear of love, when every man stands still 
By the last sea, 
And the princes of the sea come down 
To lay away their robes, to judge the earth 
And its dead, and we dead stand undefended everywhere, 
And my bodies--father and child and unskilled criminal-- 
Ridiculously kneel to bare my scars, 
My sneaking crimes, to God's unpitying stars.

6. 
Staring politely, they will not mark my face 
From any murderer's, buried in this place. 
Why should they?  We are nothing but a man.

7. 
Doty, the rapist and the murderer, 
Sleeps in a ditch of fire, and cannot hear; 
And where, in earth or hell's unholy peace, 
Men's suicides will stop, God knows, not I. 
Angels and pebbles mock me under trees. 
Earth is a door I cannot even face. 
Order be damned, I do not want to die, 
Even to keep Belaire, Ohio, safe. 
The hackles on my neck are fear, not grief. 
(Open, dungeon!  Open, roof of the ground!) 
I hear the last sea in the Ohio grass, 
Heaving a tide of gray disastrousness. 
Wrinkles of winter ditch the rotted face 
Of Doty, killer, imbecile, and thief: 
Dirt of my flesh, defeated, underground. 
  

Saint Judas

When I went out to kill myself, I caught 
A pack of hoodlums beating up a man. 
Running to spare his suffering, I forgot 
My name, my number, how my day began, 
How soldiers milled around the garden stone 
And sang amusing songs; how all that day 
Their javelins measured crowds; how I alone 
Bargained the proper coins, and slipped away.

Banished from heaven, I found this victim beaten, 
Stripped, kneed, and left to cry.  Dropping my rope 
Aside, I ran, ignored the uniforms: 
Then I remembered bread my flesh had eaten, 
The kiss that ate my flesh.  Flayed without hope, 
I held the man for nothing in my arms. 
  
  

  
On the Skeleton of a Hound

Nightfall, that saw the morning-glories float
Tendril and string against the crumbling wall,
Nurses him now, his skeleton for grief,
His locks for comfort curled among the leaf.
Shuttles of moonlight weave his shadow tall,
Milkweed and dew flow upward to his throat.
Now catbird feathers plume the apple mound,
And starlings drowse to winter up the ground.
Thickened away from speech by fear, I move 
Around the body. Over his forepaws, steep
Declivities darken down the moonlight now,
And the long throat that bayed a year ago
Declines from summer. Flies would love to leap
Between his eyes and hum away the space
Between the ears, the hollow where a hare
Could hide; another jealous dog would tumble
The bones apart, angry, the shining crumble
Of a great body gleaming in the air;
Quivering pigeons foul his broken face.
I can imagine men who search the earth
For handy resurrections, overturn
The body of a beetle in its grave;
Whispering men digging for gods might delve
A pocket for these bones, then slowly burn
Twigs in the leaves, pray for another birth.
But I will turn my face away from this
Ruin of summer, collapse of fur and bone.
For once a white hare huddled up the grass,
The sparrows flocked away to see the race.
I stood on darkness, clinging to a stone,
I saw the two leaping alive on ice,
On earth, on leaf, humus and withered vine:
The rabbit splendid in a shroud of shade,
The dog carved on the sunlight, on the air,
Fierce and magnificent his rippled hair,
The cockleburs shaking around his head.
Then, suddenly, the hare leaped beyond pain
Out of the open meadow, and the hound
Followed the voiceless dancer to the moon,
To dark, to death, to other meadows where
Singing young women dance around a fire,
Where love reveres the living.

                                                    I alone
Scatter this hulk about the dampened ground;
And while the moon rises beyond me, throw
The ribs and spine out of their perfect shape.
For a last charm to the dead, I lift the skull
And toss it over the maples like a ball.
Strewn to the woods, now may that spirit sleep
That flamed over the ground a year ago.
I know the mole will heave a shinbone over,
The earthworm snuggle for a nap on paws,
The honest bees build honey in the head;
The earth knows how to handle the great dead
Who lived the body out, and broke its laws,
Knocked down a fence, tore up a field of clover.


Beginning

The moon drops one or two feathers into the fields.
The dark wheat listens.
Be still.
Now.
There they are, the moon's young, trying
Their wings.
Between trees, a slender woman lifts up the lovely shadow
Of her face, and now she steps into the air, now she is gone
Wholly, into the air.
I stand alone by an elder tree, I do not dare breathe
Or move.
I listen.
The wheat leans back toward its own darkness,
And I lean toward mine.


Trying to Pray

This time, I have left my body behind me, crying
In its dark thorns.
Still,
There are good things in this world.
It is dusk.
It is the good darkness
Of women's hands that touch loaves.
The spirit of a tree begins to move.
I touch leaves.
I close my eyes and think of water.

 

Depressed by a Book of Bad Poetry, I Walk Toward an Unused
Pasture and Invite the Insects to Join Me

Relieved, I let the book fall behind a stone.
I climb a slight rise of grass.
I do not want to disturb the ants
Who are walking single file up the fence post,
Carrying small white petals,
Casting shadows so frail that I can see through them.
I close my eyes for a moment and listen.
The old grasshoppers
Are tired, they leap heavily now,
Their thighs are burdened.
I want to hear them, they have clear sounds to make.
Then lovely, far off, a dark cricket begins
In the maple trees.


Small Frogs Killed On The Highway
Still,
I would leap too
Into the light,
If I had the chance.
It is everything, the wet green stalk of the field
On the other side of the road.
They crouch there, too, faltering in terror
And take strange wing. Many
Of the dead never moved, but many
Of the dead are alive forever in the split second
Auto headlights more sudden
Than their drivers know.
The drivers burrow backward into dank pools
Where nothing begets
Nothing.

Across the road, tadpoles are dancing
On the quarter thumbnail
Of the moon. They can't see,
Not yet.

Hook
I was only a young man
In those days. On that evening
The cold was so God damned
Bitter there was nothing.
Nothing. I was in trouble
With a woman, and there was nothing
There but me and dead snow.

I stood on the street corner
In Minneapolis, lashed
This way and that.
Wind rose from some pit,
Hunting me.
Another bus to Saint Paul
Would arrive in three hours,
If I was lucky.

Then the young Sioux
Loomed beside me, his scars
Were just my age.

Ain't got no bus here
A long time, he said.
You got enough money
To get home on?

What did they do
To your hand? I answered.
He raised up his hook into the terrible starlight
And slashed the wind.

Oh, that? he said.
I had a bad time with a woman. Here,
You take this.

Did you ever feel a man hold
Sixty-five cents
In a hook,
And place it
Gently
In your freezing hand?

I took it.
It wasn't the money I needed.
But I took it.

A Note Left in Jimmy Leonard's Shack

Near the dry river's water-mark we found
         Your brother Minnegan,
Flopped like a fish against the muddy ground.
Beany, the kid whose yellow hair turns green,
Told me to find you, even in the rain,
        And tell you he was drowned.

I hid behind the chassis on the bank,
         The wreck of someone's Ford:
I was afraid to come and wake you drunk:
You told me once the waking up was hard,
The daylight beating at you like a board.
        Blood in my stomach sank.

Beside, you told him never to go out
          Along the river-side
Drinking and singing, clattering about.
You might have thrown a rock at me and cried
I was to blame, I let him fall in the road
          And pitch down on his side.

Well, I'll get hell enough when I get home
          For coming up this far,
Leaving the note, and running as I came.
I'll go and tell my father where you are.
You'd better go find Minnegan before
         Policemen hear and come.

Beany went home, and I got sick and ran,
          You old son of a bitch.
You better hurry down to Minnegan;
He's drunk or dying now, I don't know which,
Rolled in the roots and garbage like a fish,
           The poor old man.



           Adam and Eve

I wanted to punch her right in the mouth and that's the truth.

After all, we had gotten from the station of the flickering glances
to the station of the hungry mouths,
from the shoreline of skirts and faded jeans
to the ocean of unencumbered skin,
from the perilous mountaintop of the apartment steps
to the sanctified valley of the bed--

the candle fluttering upon the dresser top, its little yellow blade
sending up its whiff of waxy smoke,
and I could smell her readiness
like a dank cloud above a field,

when at the crucial moment, the all-important moment,
the moment standing at attention,
she held her milk white hand agitatedly
over the entrance to her body and said No,
and my brain burst into flame.

If I couldn't sink myself in her like a dark spur
or dissolve into her like a clod thrown in a river,
can I go all the way in the saying, and say
I wanted to punch her right in the face?
Am I allowed to say that,
that I wanted to punch her right in her soft face?

Or is the saying just another instance of rapaciousness,
just another way of doing what I wanted then,
by saying it?

Is a man just an animal, and is a woman not an animal?
Is the name of the animal power?
Is it true that the man wishes to see the woman
hurt with her own pleasure

and the woman wishes to see the expression on the man's face
of someone falling from great height,
that the woman thrills with the power of her weakness
and the man is astonished by the weakness of his power?

Is the sexual chase a hunt where the animal inside
drags the human down
into a jungle made of vowels,
hormonal undergrowth of sweat and hair,

or is this an obsolete idea
lodged like a fossil
in the brain of the ape
who lives inside the man?

Can the fossil be surgically removed
or dissolved, or redesigned
so the man can be a human being, like a woman?

Does the woman see the man as a house
where she might live in safety,
and does the man see the woman as a door
through which he might escape
the hated prison of himself,

and when the door is locked,
does he hate the door instead?
Does he learn to hate all doors?

I've seen rain turn into snow then back to rain,
and I've seen making love turn into fucking
then back to making love,
and no one covered up their faces out of shame,
no one rose and walked into the lonely maw of night.

But where was there, in fact, to go?
Are some things better left unsaid?
Shall I tell you her name?
Can I say it again,
that I wanted to punch her right in the face?

Until we say the truth, there can be no tenderness.
As long as there is desire, we will not be safe.




Dickhead
 

To whomever taught me the word dickhead,
I owe a debt of thanks.
It gave me a way of being in the world of men
when I most needed one,

when I was pale and scrawny,
naked, goosefleshed
as a plucked chicken

in a supermarket cooler, a poor
forked thing stranded in the savage
universe of puberty, where wild

jockstraps flew across the steamy
skies of locker rooms,
and everybody fell down laughing

at jokes I didn’t understand.
But dickhead was a word as dumb
and democratic as a hammer, an object

you could pick up in your hand,
and swing,
saying dickhead this and dickhead that,

a song that meant the world
was yours enough at least
to bang on like a garbage can,

and knowing it, and having that
beautiful ugliness always
cocked and loaded in my mind,

protected me and calmed me like a psalm. 
Now I have myself become
a beautiful ugliness,

and my weakness is a fact
so well established that
it makes me calm,

and I am calm enough 
to be grateful for the lives I
never have to live again;

but I remember all the bad old days
back in the world of men,
when everything was serious, mysterious, scary,

hairier and bigger than I was;
I recall when flesh
was what I hated, feared

and was excluded from:
Hardly knowing what I did,
or what would come of it,

I made a word my friend.




Texaco

The nozzle of the gas pump
plunged into the flank of the car
like the curved beak of a predatory bird

looks like it is drinking
or maybe I'm light-headed
from the fumes

or from the slanted light
of Thursday afternoon.
—Still, it is a powerful moment

when I squeeze the trigger of the handle
and feel, beneath the stained cement,
the deep shudder and convulsion

of the gasoline begin
its plunging rush in my direction.
Out of the guts of the earth,

filtered through sand and blood
down the long hose of history
towards the very nipple of this moment:

—the mechanical ticking of the pump,
the sound of my car drinking—
filling my tank with a necessary story

about the road, how we have
to have it to go down;
the whole world construed around

this singular, solitary act
as if I myself had conjured it
from some strange thirst.




Lie Down with a Man
In those days I thought I had to 
do everything I was afraid of,
so I lay down with a man.

It was one item on a list--
sleeping in the graveyard, under the full moon,
not looking away from the burned girl's stricken face,
strapping myself into the catapult
of some electric blue pill.

It was the seventies, a whole generation of us
was more than willing to chainsaw through
the branch that we were sitting on
to see what falling felt like--bump bump bump.

Knowing the worse about yourself
seemed like self-improvement then,
and suffering was adventure.

So I lay down with a man,
which I really don't remember
except that it was humorless.

Curtains fluttered in the breeze
from the radio's black grill. Van Morrison
filled up the room like astral aftershave.

I lay my mass of delusions
next to his mass of delusions
in the dark room where I struggled
with the old adversary, myself


--in the form, this time, of a body--
someplace between heaven and earth,
two things I was afraid of.




The Replacement


And across the country I know
they are replacing my brother's brain
with the brain of a man;

one gesture, one word, one neuron at a time
with surgical precision
they are teaching him to hook his thumbs
into his belt, to iron his mouth as flat
as the horizon, and make his eyes
reflective as a piece of tin.

It is a kind of cooking
the male child undergoes:
to toughen him, he is dipped repeatedly
in insult--peckerwood, shitbag, faggot,
pussy, dicksucker--until spear points
will break against his epidermis,
until his is impossible to disappoint.

Then he walks out into the street
ready for a game of corporate poker
with a hard-on for the Dow-Jones
like this hormonal language I am
flexing like a bicep
to show who's boss.

But I'm not the boss.
And there is nothing I can do to stop it,
and would I if I could?
What else is there for him to be
except a man?
If they fail,
he stumbles through his life
like an untied shoe.
If they succeed, he may become
something even I can't love.

Already the photograph I have of him
is out of date
but in it he is standing by the pool
without a shirt: too young, too white, too weak,
with feelings he is too inept to hide
splashed over his face--

goofy, proud, shy,
he's smiling at the camera
as if he were under the illusion
that someone loved him so well
they would not ever ever ever
turn him over to the world.


Why the Young Men Are So Ugly


They have little tractors in their blood
and all day the tractors climb up and down
inside their arms and legs, their
collarbones and heads.

That is why they yell and scream and slam the barbells
down into their clanking slots,
making the metal ring like sledgehammers on iron,
like dungeon prisoners rattling their chains.

That is why they shriek their tires at the stopsign,
why they turn the base up on the stereo
until it shakes the traffic light, until it
dryhumps the eardrum of the crossing guard.

Testosterone is a drug,
and they say No, No, No until
they are overwhelmed and punch
their buddy in the face for joy,

or make a joke about gravy and bottomless holes
to a middle-aged waitress who is gently
setting down the plate in front of them.

If they are grotesque, if
what they say and do is often nothing more
than a kind of psychopathic fart,

it is only because of the tractors,
the tractors in their blood,
revving their engines, chewing up the turf
inside their arteries and veins
It is the testosterone tractor

constantly climbing the mudhill of the world
and dragging the young man behind it
by a chain around his leg.
In the stink and the noise, in the clouds
of filthy exhaust

is where they live. It is the tractors
that make them
what they are. While they make being a man
look like a disease.
 

America

Then one of the students with blue hair and a tongue stud
Says that America is for him a maximum-security prison

Whose walls are made of RadioShacks and Burger Kings, and MTV episodes
Where you can't tell the show from the commercials,

And as I consider how to express how full of shit I think he is,
He says that even when he's driving to the mall in his Isuzu

Trooper with a gang of his friends, letting rap music pour over them
Like a boiling Jacuzzi full of ballpeen hammers, even then he feels

Buried alive, captured and suffocated in the folds
Of the thick satin quilt of America

And I wonder if this is a legitimate category of pain,
or whether he is just spin doctoring a better grade,

And then I remember that when I stabbed my father in the dream last night,
It was not blood but money

That gushed out of him, bright green hundred-dollar bills
Spilling from his wounds, and—this is the weird part—,

He gasped, "Thank god—those Ben Franklins were
Clogging up my heart—

And so I perish happily,
Freed from that which kept me from my liberty"—

Which is when I knew it was a dream, since my dad
Would never speak in rhymed couplets,

And I look at the student with his acne and cell phone and phony ghetto clothes
And I think, "I am asleep in America too,

And I don't know how to wake myself either,"
And I remember what Marx said near the end of his life:

"I was listening to the cries of the past,
When I should have been listening to the cries of the future."

But how could he have imagined 100 channels of 24-hour cable
Or what kind of nightmare it might be

When each day you watch rivers of bright merchandise run past you
And you are floating in your pleasure boat upon this river

Even while others are drowning underneath you
And you see their faces twisting in the surface of the waters

And yet it seems to be your own hand
Which turns the volume higher?

 

Rap Music

Twenty-six men trapped in a submarine
are pounding on the walls with a metal pipe,
shouting what they'll do when they get out.
Or they are rolled up in a rug in the back
of a rug truck that has wrecked.

No, it's the car pulled up next to mine in traffic
with the windows rolled down and the sound turned up
so loud it puts everything in italics: enough to make the asphalt thump
and the little leaves of shrubbery
in front of the nice brick houses quake.

I don't know what's going on inside that portable torture chamber,
but I have a bad suspicion
there's a lot of dead white people in there

on a street lit by burning police cars
where a black man is striking the head of a white one
again and again with a brick,
then lifting the skull to drink blood from the hole—

But that's what art is for, isn't it?
It's about giving expression to the indignation—
it's for taking the in out of the inhibitchin;
so maybe my ears are just a little hysterical
or maybe my fear is a little historical

and you know, I'd like to form an exploratory committee
to investigate that question—
and I'd like that committee to produce a documentary
called The Sweet Sounds of Afro-American,

but all this ugly noise is getting in the way,
and what I'm not supposed to say
is that Black for me is a country
more foreign than China or Vagina,
more alarming than going down Niagara on Viagra—

and it makes me feel stupid when I get close
like a little white dog on the edge of a big dark woods
I'm not supposed to look directly into

and there's this pounding noise
like a heartbeat full of steroids,
like a thousand schizophrenic Shakespeares
killing themselves at high volume—

this tangled roar
that has to be shut up or blown away or sealed off
or actually mentioned and entered.

 

Reading Moby-Dick at 30,000 Feet

At this height, Kansas
is just a concept,
a checkerboard design of wheat and corn

no larger than the foldout section
of my neighbor's travel magazine.
At this stage of the journey

I would estimate the distance
between myself and my own feelings
is roughly the same as the mileage

from Seattle to New York,
so I can lean back into the upholstered interval
between Muzak and lunch,

a little bored, a little old and strange.
I remember, as a dreamy
backyard kind of kid,

tilting up my head to watch
those planes engrave the sky
in lines so steady and so straight

they implied the enormous concentration
of good men,
but now my eyes flicker

from the in-flight movie
to the stewardess's pantyline,
then back into my book,

where men throw harpoons at something
much bigger and probably
better than themselves,

wanting to kill it,
wanting to see great clouds of blood erupt
to prove that they exist.

Imagine being born and growing up,
rushing through the world for sixty years
at unimaginable speeds.

Imagine a century like a room so large,
a corridor so long
you could travel for a lifetime

and never find the door,
until you had forgotten
that such a thing as doors exist.

Better to be on board the Pequod,
with a mad one-legged captain
living for revenge.

Better to feel the salt wind
spitting in your face,
to hold your sharpened weapon high,

to see the glisten
of the beast beneath the waves.
What a relief it would be

to hear someone in the crew
cry out like a gull,
Oh Captain, Captain!

Where are we going now?       



February

This is the second month of the year I turn thirty-seven.
Already the weather is warming in southeast Texas, rushing
The weeks along; the trees have to work to keep up. One day
I'll look over my head and the elm will be leafed out,
And then it will be summer. And probably I'll be working
On my birthday, probably teaching a couple of classes,
And I'll say to myself, it's just as well, who needs to think about
Turning thirty-seven, and I'll go back to my regular life,
Smiling and talking to students in the hallway,
Breaking a sweat on the short walk from the door
To the parked car, rolling all the windows down
But not without glancing at the sky for stormclouds,
Because a storm will be breaking every day then after noon,
Lasting about an hour, and subsiding back to sun. You learn
Such things about the weather when you've lived in a place
For a while. Or maybe it's really what some people say,
It's like that everywhere; I haven't been anywhere near
Everywhere, and maybe I'll never make it.
But there were years when I liked to search out danger,
Late nights I learned each secret worn-out cars
Bouncing through the ruts of logging roads could take me to.
I learned about love like that; the full moon pierced
The windshield like a spike and I knew it was love
When the strong, agile boy above me sighed
And pushed deeper inside me. I knew it was love
When I didn't want to close my eyes. I learned about trouble
And I knew it was trouble when I dropped out of high school
My senior year and took to prowling the roads with boys;
We took to shooting heroin under the spring sky,
We'd lie back together in the roadside grass and all let go
Of our suffering, we were having a hard time growing up,
It felt good to do a terrible thing together.
No one could find us there. No one was looking.
We would've counted the stars, but that was work.
Instead we talked about loving one another, and I guess
You'd say it was the heroin talking, but we thought we felt it,
We were free together, we knew how we were when no one
Could know us because we were doing evil. I took myself
Far from those foothills the first chance I could.
I didn't find out what became of my friends, it looked like
Some of them were headed for prison; I loved them once
But I wouldn't love them now, and I didn't want to
Think about mixing love and trouble, the trick I learned
And never gave up; I just got older, and stopped
Getting into the trouble of the young; I discovered
The trouble of the older.
                                     This is the second month
Of the year I turn thirty-seven. Already the little fists
Of leaves are forming inside the knotted ends of twigs
All over Houston. The cold weather is over. This winter
Again there was no freeze. And tonight it's very late,
And it's Sunday, and no cars pass on the big road
By the house, but out there in the night
Some kids about seventeen are doing terrible things
They'll get by with, and grow out of, and remember
The way they'll remember what love felt like at first,
Before it stopped being the surest path to ruination,
Before it had done the worst it could and passed away.
And to them it's as if those who lived this life before them
Moved with the jerky speeded-up gestures of characters
In old-fashioned movies, their expressions intense
And exaggerated; they roll their eyes and loll their tongues
When the heroin hits their blood. It's as if the beauty
Of evil lives only in the present, where the drop of dope
Clinging to the tip of the stainless steel point
Catches the light like dew; and it doesn't matter
That the light falls from a streetlamp with a short in it,
And the impatient boy with the syringe in his hand
Will touch the drop back into the spoon
So as not to waste it. It's his instinct telling him
How much it means to live this now, before he knows
Better, while he still has a chance to survive it.
It's the moon over his head with its polished horns
That would slip through his skin if he touched them.
It's the trees leaping to life in his blood, greenness
Unfurling so hard it almost bursts his heart.


The Accident

I had no business there in the first place— 
I'm putting on weight—but the counter help was all smiles,
Having survived the lunch hour crunch. My husband and I
Ordered burgers and fries; I was in front, so I chose
A seat on the far side, back to the window.
I picked off two thin rings of onion; the fries were limp.
Something about the car, maybe, both of us
Interested, me a little bitchy, so it was almost the way you turn
Instinctively, say from a spider web in a darkened hall,
How I looked across the restaurant and found her face,
Left cheekbone swollen to a baseball, the same eye blackened,
Heavy make-up, front tooth out in a jack-o-lantern grin
As she tried to look friendly to the young waitress
Her husband motioned over. He rested one hand
On his wife's shoulder, solicitous, the other waving
A lit cigarette, a small man, dark-haired, now laughing aloud,
Glancing at the uncombed head of his beaten wife again
Turning her back to the room, though not crowded,
All suddenly staring, reading the last few hours
Of those lives in a horror of recognition.
She cupped her hand shading the side of her face,
You could see lumps of vertebrae through her t-shirt,
And he kept on talking, smiling at her, with a slight tilt
Of his head, as if saying poor baby, something happened to her,
Good thing I'm here to take care of her, a car wreck,
A bad one, a smash-up, and all of us looked
And knew better. At the table with them was a little girl.
The man, the woman, the five-year-old daughter— 
Even the man and the beaten woman had the same features,
As people do who have lived together for years. I couldn't see
The child's face. He was jotting a note on a small pad,
The waitress's name, as if to write a letter praising
Her fine service, and she smiled through her horror, she
Hardly more than sixteen, with clear pale skin. Next to us
A woman in permed hair and suit rose to leave, lunch untouched,
With her daughter. She carried a leather legal-sized folder.
We left soon after, heads turned, not looking,
Because sometime the man and woman would go
Home to the privacy of a city apartment, no neighbors
Home all day to hear, but first I said, in the restaurant,
Across the room where he couldn't hear, If I had a gun 
I'd blow his brains out, and I thought of that moment
Familiar from movies, the round black hole in the forehead
Opening, the back of the skull blowing out frame by frame
Like a baseball smashing a window, but no one near
Would've even been bloodied because no one was standing anywhere
Near him, his hand on the beaten woman's shoulder
Might as well've been yards from his body.

I was taught not to write about this. But my teacher,
A man with a reputation who hoped I would make
Good, never knew that I, too, have been hit in the face by a man.
He knew only my clumsy efforts to cast what happened
Into "characters," and he loved the beauty in poetry.
Maybe what I had written was awkward. Maybe my teacher
Guessed what happened and forbade me writing it
For some good reason, he cared for me, or he feared
He too might've slapped my face, because I, like the character
In that first effort, was bitching to the heavens and a redneck
Boyfriend, and we argued outdoors, near a stack of light wood
Used to kindle the stove like everyone has
In the foothills of North Carolina. That day I railed
Like a caricature of a bitching redneck woman,
Hands on hips, sometimes a clenched fist, I was
Bitching, I think, as he planned some stupid ting
I hated, like fishing, pitching horseshoes, driving
To visit his mother on Sundays, her tiny house
Tangled in dirt roads, where she sat in the kitchen dipping snuff.
Whatever he wanted to do was harmless,
But so was my shrieking, my furious pleading, an endless loop
Inside my head rolling I want to be rid of him, and he slapped me
Across my open mouth, I felt myself shut up and staggered,
Because he was a large man, and I was a large woman,
He had to make sure he hit me pretty hard,
Both of us strong and mad as hell, early
One Saturday morning, when he wanted to do what he wanted to do
And I wanted to keep him from it. He slapped me
Twice, open-handed, knocking me, open-handed, to my knees,
In kindling, so my knees were scraped bloody and my hand
Closed on a foot and a half of inch-thick pine, and I stumbled up,
Swinging, my eyes popping wide, till I brought it down
Hard across his shoulder, I saw how the rage on his face
Flashed to fear, just that quick, a second, or less,
And he turned to run but he made the wrong choice,
If he'd gone to the road I wouldn've followed, but he ran
Inside my "duplex" apartment, an old country house
Cut in two. So I cornered him upstairs and knocked him out.
It was simple. He fell so hard, I thought I've killed him;
I was throwing my clothes in a paper bag when I heard him
Sobbing. In the bathroom mirror I found the black eye and lop-sided lip,
And it seemed as if I might still take it back, the last ten minutes,
The chase, the beating, the high-pitched screaming,
The stubborn need to go fishing. But the make-up I disdained
In those years—I had just turned twenty—didn't do much
To cover the bruises. His face was clear. The knot on his head
Stopped swelling under ice. It was easy to tell him
To get the hell out and only regret it every other minute
Since there were no children, no marriage, even,
And I was young and believed I had proven
I was strong. I had beaten a man to his knees.
Months later I would go to college and stay safely there for years,
Not letting on to anyone the terrible things I'd done, until I wrote
That clumsy poem with the unbelievable characters, and now I've tried
To do it again, this time with different characters, I've defied
My teacher, who meant for me to learn to write well,
Who meant for the world to think well of me,
And I am not sorry. If he asked why I would say
I had to do it, and that lie would be like the lie of living
Without telling, till one day seeing the beaten face,
What scared me most, the missing tooth, the tangled hair, the vertebrae,
The daughter. There is no use thinking what it means
About me to say this: I am not sorry. I might have killed
That man. I might have blown his brains out.               
 


 My Papa's Waltz 
 

The whiskey on your breath 
Could make a small boy dizzy; 
But I hung on like death: 
Such waltzing was not easy.

We romped until the pans 
Slid from the kitchen shelf; 
My mother's countenance 
Could not unfrown itself.

The hand that held my wrist 
Was battered on one knuckle; 
At every step you missed 
My right ear scraped a buckle.

You beat time on my head 
With a palm caked hard by dirt, 
Then waltzed me off to bed 
Still clinging to your shirt.
 

Child on Top of a Greenhouse

The wind billowing out the seat of my britches,
My feet crackling splinters of glass and dried putty,
The half-grown chrysanthemums staring up like accusers,
Up through the streaked glass, flashing with sunlight,
A few white clouds all rushing eastward,
A line of elms plunging and tossing like horses,
And everyone, everyone pointing up and shouting!

Cuttings (Later)

This urge, wrestle, resurrection of dry sticks,
Cut stems struggling to put down feet,
What saint strained so much,
Rose on such lopped limbs to a new life?
I can hear, underground, that sucking and sobbing,
In my veins, in my bones I feel it—
The small waters seeping upward,
The tight grains parting at last.
When sprouts break out,
Slippery as fish,
I quail, lean to beginnings, sheath-wet. 



The Meadow Mouse

1.

In a shoe box stuffed in an old nylon stocking
Sleeps the baby mouse I found in the meadow,
Where he trembled and shook beneath a stick
Till I caught him up by the tail and brought him in,
Cradled in my hand,
A little quaker, the whole body of him trembling,
His absurd whiskers sticking out like a cartoon-mouse,
His feet like small leaves,
Little lizard-feet,
Whitish and spread wide when he tried to struggle away,
Wriggling like a minuscule puppy.

Now he's eaten his three kinds of cheese and drunk from his
bottle-cap watering-trough—
So much he just lies in one corner,
His tail curled under him, his belly big
As his head; his bat-like ears
Twitching, tilting toward the least sound.

Do I imagine he no longer trembles
When I come close to him?
He seems no longer to tremble.

2.

But this morning the shoe-box house on the back porch is empty.
Where has he gone, my meadow mouse,
My thumb of a child that nuzzled in my palm? —
To run under the hawk's wing,
Under the eye of the great owl watching from the elm-tree,
To live by courtesy of the shrike, the snake, the tom-cat.

I think of the nestling fallen into the deep grass,
The turtle gasping in the dusty rubble of the highway,
The paralytic stunned in the tub, and the water rising,—
All things innocent, hapless, forsaken.


The Geranium

When I put her out, once, by the garbage pail,
She looked so limp and bedraggled,
So foolish and trusting, like a sick poodle,
Or a wizened aster in late September,
I brought her back in again
For a new routine—
Vitamins, water, and whatever
Sustenance seemed sensible
At the time: she'd lived
So long on gin, bobbie pins, half-smoked cigars, dead beer,
Her shriveled petals falling
On the faded carpet, the stale
Steak grease stuck to her fuzzy leaves.
(Dried-out, she creaked like a tulip.)

The things she endured!—
The dumb dames shrieking half the night
Or the two of us, alone, both seedy,
Me breathing booze at her,
She leaning out of her pot toward the window.

Near the end, she seemed almost to hear me—
And that was scary—
So when that snuffling cretin of a maid
Threw her, pot and all, into the trash-can,
I said nothing.

But I sacked the presumptuous hag the next week,
I was that lonely.

 

Dolor

I have known the inexorable sadness of pencils,
Neat in their boxes, dolor of pad and paper weight,
All the misery of manilla folders and mucilage,
Desolation in immaculate public places,
Lonely reception room, lavatory, switchboard,
The unalterable pathos of basin and pitcher,
Ritual of multigraph, paper-clip, comma,
Endless duplicaton of lives and objects.
And I have seen dust from the walls of institutions,
Finer than flour, alive, more dangerous than silica,
Sift, almost invisible, through long afternoons of tedium,
Dropping a fine film on nails and delicate eyebrows,
Glazing the pale hair, the duplicate grey standard faces.

 

 

Root Cellar
Nothing would sleep in that cellar, dank as a ditch,
Bulbs broke out of boxes hunting for chinks in the dark,
Shoots dangled and drooped,
Lolling obscenely from mildewed crates,
Hung down long yellow evil necks, like tropical snakes.
And what a congress of stinks!
Roots ripe as old bait,
Pulpy stems, rank, silo-rich,
Leaf-mold, manure, lime, piled against slippery planks.
Nothing would give up life:
Even the dirt kept breathing a small breath.


Apostle Town 
 

After your death. 
It was windy every day. 
Every day. 
Opposed us like a wall. 
We went. 
Shouting sideways at one another. 
Along the road. 
It was useless. 
The spaces between us. 
Got hard. 
They are empty spaces. 
And yet they are solid. 
And black and grievous. 
As gaps between the teeth. 
Of an old woman. 
You knew years ago. 
When she was. 
Beautiful the nerves pouring around in her like palace fire. 
  
 

Love Town

She ran in. 
Wet corn. 
Yellow braid. 
Down her back. 
 

Town of the Sound of a Twig Breaking

Their faces I thought were knives. 
The way they pointed them at me. 
And waited. 
A hunter is someone who listens. 
So hard to his prey it pulls the weapon. 
Out of his hand and impales. 
Itself. 
  
 

Town of Spring Once Again

"Spring is always like what it used to be." 
Said an old Chinese man. 
Rain hissed down the windows. 
Longings from a great distance. 
Reached us. 
  
 

Bride Town

Hanging on the daylight black. 
As an overcoat with no man in it one cold bright. 
Noon the Demander was waiting for me. 
  
 

Town on the Way through God's Woods

Tell me. 
Have you ever seen woods so. 
Deep so. 
Every tree a word does your heart stop? 
Once I saw a cloud over Bolivia so deep. 
Mountains were cowering do you ever? 
Look in so quick you see the secret. 
Word inside the word? 
As in an abandoned railway car. 
One winter afternoon I saw. 
The word for "God's woods." 



The Day Lady Died

 It is 12:20 in New York a Friday 
three days after Bastille day, yes 
it is 1959 and I go get a shoeshine 
because I will get off the 4:19 in Easthampton 
at 7:15 and then go straight to dinner 
and I don’t know the people who will feed meI walk up the muggy street beginning to sun 
and have a hamburger and a malted and buy 
an ugly NEW WORLD WRITING to see what the poets 
in Ghana are doing these days 
                                                         I go on to the bank 
and Miss Stillwagon (first name Linda I once heard) 
doesn’t even look up my balance for once in her life 
and in the GOLDEN GRIFFIN I get a little Verlaine 
for Patsy with drawings by Bonnard although I do 
Brendan Behan’s new play or Le Balcon or Les Negres 
of Genet, but I don’t, I stick with Verlaine 
after practically going to sleep with quandarinessand for Mike I just stroll into the PARK LANE 
Liquor Store and ask for a bottle of Strega and 
then I go back where I came from to 6th Avenue 
and the tobacconist in the Ziegfeld Theatre and 
casually ask for a carton of Gauloises and a carton 
of Picayunes, and a NEW YORK POST with her face on itand I am sweating a lot by now and thinking of 
leaning on the john door in the 5 SPOT 
while she whispered a song along the keyboard 
to Mal Waldron and everyone and I stopped breathing


 

Why I am Not A Painter

I am not a painter, I am a poet. 
Why? I think I would rather be 
a painter, but I am not. Well,
for instance, Mike Goldberg 
is starting a painting. I drop in. 
"Sit down and have a drink" be 
says. I drink; we drink. I look 
up. "You have SARDINES in it." 
"Yes, it needed something there."

"Oh." I go and the days go by 
and I drop in again. The painting 
is going on, and I go, and the days 
go by. I drop in. The painting is 
finished. "Where's SARDINES?" 
All that's left is just
letters, "It was too much," Mike says.

But me? One day I am thinking of 
a color: orange. I write a line 
about orange. Pretty soon it is a 
whole page of words, not lines. 
Then another page. There should be 
so much more, not of orange, of 
words, of how terrible orange is 
and life. Days go by. It is even in 
prose, I am a real poet. My poem 
is finished and I haven't mentioned 
orange yet. It's twelve poems, I call 
it ORANCES. And one day in a gallery 
I see Mike's painting, called SARDINES. 
 

Poem

Lana Turner has collapsed!
I was trotting along and suddenly
it started raining and snowing
and you said it was hailing
but hailing hits you on the head 
hard so it was really snowing and
raining and I was in such a hurry
to meet you but the traffic
was acting exactly like the sky
and suddenly I see a headline
LANA TURNER HAS COLLAPSED!
there is no snow in Hollywood
there is no rain in California
I have been to lots of parties
and acted perfectly disgraceful
but I never actually collapsed
oh Lana Turner we love you get up

 

The Eager Note on My Door Said Call Me

The eager note on my door said "Call me,"
call when you get in!" so I quickly threw
a few tangerines into my overnight bag,
straightened my eyelids and shoulders, and

headed straight for the door. It was autumn
by the time I got around the corner, oh all
unwilling to be either pertinent or bemused, but
the leaves were brighter than grass on the sidewalk!

Funny, I thought, that the lights are on this late
and the hall door open; still up at this hour, a
champion jai-alai player like himself? Oh fie!
for shame! What a host, so zealous! And he was

there in the hall, flat on a sheet of blood that
ran down the stairs. I did appreciate it. There are few
hosts who so thoroughly prepare to greet a guest
only casually invited, and that several months ago. 

 

To the Harbormaster

I wanted to be sure to reach you;
though my ship was on the way it got caught
in some moorings. I am always tying up
and then deciding to depart. In storms and
at sunset, with the metallic coils of the tide
around my fathomless arms, I am unable
to understand the forms of my vanity
or I am hard alee with my Polish rudder
in my hand and the sun sinking. To
you I offer my hull and the tattered cordage
of my will. The terrible channels where
the wind drives me against the brown lips
of the reeds are not all behind me. Yet
I trust the sanity of my vessel; and
if it sinks it may well be in answer
to the reasoning of the eternal voices,
the waves which have kept me from reaching you. 

 

Song

Is it dirty
does it look dirty
that's what you think of in the city

does it just seem dirty
that's what you think of in the city
you don't refuse to breathe do you

someone comes along with a very bad character
he seems attractive. is he really. yes. very
he's attractive as his character is bad. is it. yes

that's what you think of in the city
run your finger along your no-moss mind
that's not a thought that's soot

and you take a lot of dirt off someone
is the character less bad. no. it improves constantly
you don't refuse to breathe do you 

 

As Planned

After the first glass of vodka
you can accept just about anything
of life even your own mysteriousness
you think it is nice that a box
of matches is purple and brown and is called
La Petite and comes from Sweden
for they are words that you know and that
is all you know words not their feelings
or what they mean and you write because
you know them not because you understand them
because you don't you are stupid and lazy
and will never be great but you do
what you know because what else is there?


Music


If I rest for a moment near The Equestrian
pausing for a liver sausage sandwich in the Mayflower Shoppe,
that angel seems to be leading the horse into Bergdorf's
and I am naked as a table cloth, my nerves humming.
Close to the fear of war and the stars which have disappeared.
I have in my hands only 35c, it's so meaningless to eat!
and gusts of water spray over the basins of leaves
like the hammers of a glass pianoforte. If I seem to you
to have lavender lips under the leaves of the world,
I must tighten my belt.
It's like a locomotive on the march, the season
of distress and clarity
and my door is open to the evenings of midwinter's
lightly falling snow over the newspapers.
Clasp me in your handkerchief like a tear, trumpet
of early afternoon! in the foggy autumn.
As they're putting up the Christmas trees on Park Avenue
I shall see my daydreams walking by with dogs in blankets,
put to some use before all those coloured lights come on!
But no more fountains and no more rain,
and the stores stay open terribly late.


A Step Away From Them

It's my lunch hour, so I go 
for a walk among the hum-colored
cabs. First, down the sidewalk 
where laborers feed their dirty
glistening torsos sandwiches 
and Coca-Cola, with yellow helmets 
on. They protect them from falling 
bricks, I guess. Then onto the 
avenue where skirts are flipping
above heels and blow up over 
grates. The sun is hot, but the 
cabs stir up the air. I look 
at bargains in wristwatches. There 
are cats playing in sawdust.
On 
to Times Square, where the sign 
blows smoke over my head, and higher
the waterfall pours lightly. A 
Negro stands in a doorway with a 
toothpick, languorously agitating
A blonde chorus girl clicks: he 
smiles and rubs his chin. Everything 
suddenly honks: it is 12:40 of 
a Thursday.

Neon in daylight is a 
great pleasure, as Edwin Denby would 
write, as are light bulbs in daylight. 
I stop for a cheeseburger at JULIET'S 
CORNER. Giulietta Maina, wife of 
Federico Fellini, é bell' attrice. 
And chocolate malted. A lady in 
foxes on such a day puts her poodle 
in a cab.

There are several Puerto 
Ricans on the avenue today, which 
makes it beautiful and warm. First 
Bunny died, then John Latouche, 
then Jackson Pollock. But is the 
earth as full of life was full, of them? 
And one has eaten and one walks, 
past the magazines with nudes 
and the posters for BULLFIGHT and 
the Manhatten Storage Warehouse, 
which they'll soon tear down. I 
used to think they had the Armory
Show there.

A glass of papaya juice 
and back to work. My heart is in my 
pocket, it is Poems by Pierre Reverdy. 
 

Autobiographia Literaria

When I was a child
I played by myself in a 
corner of the schoolyard
all alone.

I hated dolls and I
hated games, animals were
not friendly and birds 
flew away.

If anyone was looking 
for me I hid behind a 
tree and cried out "I am
an orphan."

And here I am, the 
center of all beauty! 
writing these poems!
Imagine!

 

 

Steps

How funny you are today New York
like Ginger Rogers in Swingtime
and St. Bridget's steeple leaning a little to the left

here I have just jumped out of a bed full of V-days
(I got tired of D-days) and blue you there still
accepts me foolish and free
all I want is a room up there
and you in it
and even the traffic halt so thick is a way
for people to rub up against each other
and when their surgical appliances lock
they stay together
for the rest of the day (what a day)
I go by to check a slide and I say
that painting's not so blue

where's Lana Turner
she's out eating
and Garbo's backstage at the Met
everyone's taking their coat off
so they can show a rib-cage to the rib-watchers
and the park's full of dancers with their tights and shoes
in little bags
who are often mistaken for worker-outers at the West Side Y
why not
the Pittsburgh Pirates shout because they won
and in a sense we're all winning
we're alive

the apartment was vacated by a gay couple
who moved to the country for fun
they moved a day too soon
even the stabbings are helping the population explosion
though in the wrong country
and all those liars have left the UN
the Seagram Building's no longer rivalled in interest
not that we need liquor (we just like it)

and the little box is out on the sidewalk
next to the delicatessen
so the old man can sit on it and drink beer
and get knocked off it by his wife later in the day
while the sun is still shining

oh god it's wonderful
to get out of bed
and drink too much coffee
and smoke too many cigarettes
and love you so much 

 

My Heart

I'm not going to cry all the time
nor shall I laugh all the time,
I don't prefer one "strain" to another.
I'd have the immediacy of a bad movie,
not just a sleeper, but also the big,
overproduced first-run kind. I want to be
at least as alive as the vulgar. And if
some aficionado of my mess says "That's
not like Frank!", all to the good! I
don't wear brown and grey suits all the time,
do I? No. I wear workshirts to the opera,
often. I want my feet to be bare,
I want my face to be shaven, and my heart--
you can't plan on the heart, but
the better part of it, my poetry, is open.

 

Meditations in an Emergency

Am I to become profligate as if I were a blonde? Or religious as if I were French?

Each time my heart is broken it makes me feel more adventurous (and how the same names keep recurring on that interminable list!), but one of these days there'll be nothing left with which to venture forth.

Why should I share you? Why don't you get rid of someone else for a change?

I am the least difficult of men. All I want is boundless love.

Even trees understand me! Good heavens, I lie under them, too, don't I? I'm just like a pile of leaves.

However, I have never clogged myself with the praises of pastoral life, nor with nostalgia for an innocent past of perverted acts in pastures. No. One need never leave the confines of New York to get all the greenery one wishes--I can't even enjoy a blade of grass unless i know there's a subway
handy, or a record store or some other sign that people do not totally _regret_ life. It is more important to affirm the least sincere; the clouds get enough attention as it is and even they continue to pass. Do they know what they're missing? Uh huh.

My eyes are vague blue, like the sky, and change all the time; they are indiscriminate but fleeting, entirely specific and disloyal, so that no one trusts me. I am always looking away. Or again at something after it has given me up. It makes me restless and that makes me unhappy, but I cannot keep them
still. If only i had grey, green, black, brown, yellow eyes; I would stay at home and do something. It's not that I'm curious. On the contrary, I am bored but it's my duty to be attentive, I am needed by things as the sky must be above the earth. And lately, so great has _their_ anxiety become, I can
spare myself little sleep.

Now there is only one man I like to kiss when he is unshaven. Heterosexuality! you are inexorably approaching. (How best discourage her?)

St. Serapion, I wrap myself in the robes of your whiteness which is like midnight in Dostoevsky. How I am to become a legend, my dear? I've tried love, but that holds you in the bosom of another and I'm always springing forth from it like the lotus--the ecstasy of always bursting forth! (but one must
not be distracted by it!) or like a hyacinth, "to keep the filth of life away," yes, even in the heart, where the filth is pumped in and slanders and pollutes and determines. I will my will, though I may become famous for a mysterious vacancy in that department, that greenhouse.

Destroy yourself, if you don't know!

It is easy to be beautiful; it is difficult to appear so. I admire you, beloved, for the trap you've set. It's like a final chapter no one reads because the plot is over.

"Fanny Brown is run away--scampered off with a Cornet of Horse; I do love that little Minx, & hope She may be happy, tho' She has vexed me by this exploit a little too.--Poor silly Cecchina! or F:B: as we used to call her.--I wish She had a good Whipping and 10,000 pounds."--Mrs. Thrale

I've got to get out of here. I choose a piece of shawl and my dirtiest suntans. I'll be back, I'll re-emerge, defeated, from the valley; you don't want me to go where you go, so I go where you don't want me to. It's only afternoon, there's a lot ahead. There won't be any mail downstairs. Turning, I spit in
the lock and the knob turns.

 

On Seeing Larry Rivers' "Washington Crossing the Delaware" at the Museum of Modern Art

Now that our hero has come back to us
in his white pants and we know his nose
trembling like a flag under fire,
we see the calm cold river is supporting
our forces, the beautiful history.

To be more revolutionary than a nun
is our desire, to be secular and intimate
as, when sighting a redcoat, you smile
and pull the trigger. Anxieties
and animosities, flaming and feeding

on theoretical considerations and
the jealous spiritualities of the abstract
the robot? they're smoke, billows above
the physical event. They have burned up.
See how free we are! as a nation of persons.

Dear father of our country, so alive
you must have lied incessantly to be
immediate, here are your bones crossed
on my breast like a rusty flintlock,
a pirate's flag, bravely specific

and ever so light in the misty glare
of a crossing by water in winter to a shore
other than that the bridge reaches for.
Don't shoot until, the white of freedom glinting
on your gun barrel, you see the general fear.

A True Account of Talking to the Sun on Fire Island


The Sun woke me this morning loud 
and clear, saying "Hey! I've been 
trying to wake you up for fifteen 
minutes. Don't be so rude, you are 
only the second poet I've ever chosen 
to speak to personally

so why
aren't you more attentive? If I could 
burn you through the window I would 
to wake you up. I can't hang around 
here all day."

"Sorry, Sun, I stayed
up late last night talking to Hal."

"When I woke up Mayakovsky he was 
a lot more prompt" the Sun said 
petulantly. "Most people are up 
already waiting to see if I'm going 
to put in an appearance."

I tried
to apologize "I missed you yesterday."
"That's better" he said. "I didn't 
know you'd come out. You may be 
wondering why I've come so close?" 
"Yes" I said beginning to feel hot 
wondering if maybe he wasn't burning me 
anyway.

"Frankly I wanted to tell you 
I like your poetry. I see a lot 
on my rounds and you're okay. You may 
not be the greatest thing on earth, but 
you're different. Now, I've heard some 
say you're crazy, they being excessively 
calm themselves to my mind, and other 
crazy poets think that you're a boring 
reactionary. Not me.

Just keep on 
like I do and pay no attention. You'll 
find that people always will complain 
about the atmosphere, either too hot 
or too cold too bright or too dark, days
too short or too long.

If you don't appear
at all one day they think you're lazy
or dead. Just keep right on, I like it.

And don't worry about your lineage 
poetic or natural. The Sun shines on 
the jungle, you know, on the tundra 
the sea, the ghetto. Wherever you were 
I knew it and saw you moving. I was waiting 
for you to get to work.

And now that you 
are making your own days, so to speak, 
even if no one reads you but me 
you won't be depressed. Not 
everyone can look up, even at me. It 
hurts their eyes."
"Oh Sun, I'm so grateful to you!"

"Thanks and remember I'm watching. It's 
easier for me to speak to you out 
here. I don't have to slide down 
between buildings to get your ear. 
I know you love Manhattan, but 
you ought to look up more often.

And
always embrace things, people earth 
sky stars, as I do, freely and with 
the appropriate sense of space. That 
is your inclination, known in the heavens 
and you should follow it to hell, if 
necessary, which I doubt.

Maybe we'll 
speak again in Africa, of which I too 
am specially fond. Go back to sleep now 
Frank, and I may leave a tiny poem 
in that brain of yours as my farewell."

"Sun, don't go!" I was awake
at last. "No, go I must, they're calling
me."
"Who are they?"

Rising he said "Some
day you'll know. They're calling to you
too." Darkly he rose, and then I slept.

Ann Arbor Variations


Wet heat drifts through the afternoon
like a campus dog, a fraternity ghost
waiting to stay home from football games.
The arches are empty clear to the sky.

Except for the leaves: those lashes of our
thinking and dreaming and drinking sight.
The spherical radiance, the Old English
look, the sum of our being, "hath perced

to the roote" all our springs and falls
and now rolls over our limpness, a daily
dragon. We lose our health in a love
of color, drown in a fountain of myriads,

as simply as children. It is too hot,
our birth was given up to screaming. Our
life on these street lawns seems silent.
The leaves chatter their comparisons

to the wind and the sky fills up
before we are out of bed. O infinite
our siestas! adobe effigies in a land
that is sick of us and our tanned flesh.

The wind blows towards us particularly
the sobbing of our dear friends on both
coasts. We are sick of living and afraid
that death will not be by water, o sea.

2
Along the walks and shaded ways
pregnant women look snidely at children.
Two weeks ago they were told, in these

selfsame pools of trefoil, "the market
for emeralds is collapsing, chlorophyll
shines in your eyes, the sea's misery

is progenitor of the dark moss which hides
on the north side of trees and cries."
What do they think of slim kids now?

and how, when the summer's gong of day
and night slithers towards their sweat
and towards the nest of their arms

and thighs, do they feel about children
whose hides are pearly with days of swimming?
Do they mistake these fresh drops for tears?

The wind works over these women constantly!
trying, perhaps, to curdle their milk
or make their spring unseasonably fearful,

season they face with dread and bright eyes,
The leaves, wrinkled or shiny like apples,
wave women courage and sigh, a void temperature.

3
The alternatives of summer do not remove
us from this place. The fainting into skies
from a diving board, the express train to
Detroit's damp bars, the excess of affection
on the couch near an open window or a Bauhaus
fire escape, the lazy regions of stars, all
are strangers. Like Mayakovsky read on steps
of cool marble, or Yeats danced in a theatre
of polite music. The classroon day of dozing
and grammar, the partial eclipse of the head
in the row in front of the head of poplars,
sweet Syrinx! last out the summer in a stay
of iron. Workmen loiter before urinals, stare
out windows at girders tightly strapped to clouds.
And in the morning we whimper as we cook
an egg, so far from fluttering sands and azure!

4
The violent No! of the sun
burns the forehead of hills.
Sand fleas arrive from Salt Lake
and most of the theatres close.

The leaves roll into cigars, or
it seems our eyes stick together
in sleep. O forest, o brook of
spice, o cool gaze of strangers!

the city tumbles towards autumn
in a convulsion of tourists
and teachers. We dance in the dark,
forget the anger of what we blame

on the day. Children toss and murmur
as a rumba blankets their trees and
beckons their stars closer, older, now.
We move o'er the world, being so much here.

It's as if Poseidon left off counting
his waters for a moment! In the fields
the silence is music like the moon.
The bullfrogs sleep in their hairy caves.

across the avenue a trefoil lamp
of the streets tosses luckily.
The leaves, finally, love us! and
moonrise! we die upon the sun.

A City Winter

1
I understand the boredom of the clerks
fatigue shifting like dunes within their eyes
a frightful nausea gumming up the works
that once was thought aggression in disguise.
Do you remember? then how lightly dead
seemed the moon when over factories
it languid slid like a barrage of lead
above the heart, the fierce inventories
of desire. Now women wander our dreams
carrying money and to our sleep's shame
our hands twitch not for swift blood-sunk triremes
nor languorous white horses nor ill fame,
but clutch the groin that clouds a pallid sky
where tow'rs are sinking in their common eye.

2
My ship is flung upon the gutter's wrist
and cries for help of storm to violate
that flesh your curiosity too late
has flushed. The stem your garter tongue would twist
has sunk upon the waveless bosom's mist,
thigh of the city, apparition, hate,
and the tower whose doves have, delicate,
fled into my blood where they are not kissed.

You have left me to the sewer's meanwhile,
and I have answered the sea's open wish
to love me as a bonfire's watchful hand
guards red the shore and guards the hairy strand,
our most elegant lascivious bile,
my ship sinking beneath the gutter's fish.

3
How can I then, my dearest winter lay,
disgorge the tasty worm that eats me up
falling onto the stem of a highway
whose ardent rainbow is the spoon's flat cup
and in the vilest of blue suited force
enamored of the heated needle's arm
finds the ministrant an own tongue's remorse
so near the blood and still so far from harm,
thus to be eaten up and gobbled down
volcanoes of speedometers, the strike
that heats the iris into flame and flow'rs
the panting chalice so a turning pike:
you are not how the gods refused to die,
and I am scarred forever neath the eye.

4
What are my eyes? if they must feed me, rank
with forgetting, in the jealous forest
of lustrous blows, so luminously blank
through smoke and in the light. All faint, at rest,
yet I am racing towards the fear that kills
them off, friends and lovers, hast'ning through tears
like alcohol high in the throat of hills
and hills of night, alluring! their black cheers
falling upon my ears like nails. And there
the bars grow thick with onanists and camps
and bivouacs of bears with clubs, are fair
with their blows, deal death beneath purple lamps
and to me! I run! closer always move,
crying my name in fields of dead I love.

5
I plunge deep within this frozen lake
whose mirrored fastnesses fill up my heart,
where tears drift from frivolity to art
all white and slobbering, and by mistake
are the sky. I'm no whale to cruise apart
in fields impassive of my stench, my sake,
my sign to crushing seas that fall like fake
pillars to crash! to sow as wake my heart

and don't be niggardly. The snow drifts low
and yet neglects to cover me, and I
dance just ahead to keep my heart in sight.
How like a queen, to seek with jealous eye
the face that flees you, hidden city, white
swan. There's no art to free me, blinded so.



Fifteen

South of the bridge on Seventeenth
I found back of the willows one summer
day a motorcycle with engine running
as it lay on its side, ticking over
slowly in the high grass. I was fifteen.

I admired all that pulsing gleam, the
shiny flanks, the demure headlights
fringed where it lay; I led it gently
to the road and stood with that
companion, ready and friendly. I was fifteen.

We could find the end of a road, meet
the sky on out Seventeenth. I thought about
hills, and patting the handle got back a 
confident opinion. On the bridge we indulged
a forward feeling, a tremble. I was fifteen.

Thinking, back farther in the grass I found
the owner, just coming to, where he had flipped
over the rail. He had blood on his hand, was pale—
I helped him walk to his machine. He ran his hand
over it, called me good man, roared away.

I stood there, fifteen.

 

Traveling Through the Dark

Traveling through the dark I found a deer
dead on the edge of the Wilson River road.
It is usually best to roll them into the canyon:
that road is narrow; to swerve might make more dead.

By glow of the tail-light I stumbled back of the car
and stood by the heap, a doe, a recent killing;
she had stiffened already, almost cold.
I dragged her off; she was large in the belly.

My fingers touching her side brought me the reason—
her side was warm; her fawn lay there waiting,
alive, still, never to be born.
Beside that mountain road I hesitated.

The car aimed ahead its lowered parking lights;
under the hood purred the steady engine.
I stood in the glare of the warm exhaust turning red;
around our group I could hear the wilderness listen.

I thought hard for us all—my only swerving—,
then pushed her over the edge into the river.

 

One Home

Mine was a Midwest home—you can keep your world.
Plain black hats rode the thoughts that made our code.
We sang hymns in the house; the roof was near God.

The light bulb that hung in the pantry made a wan light,
but we could read by it the names of preserves—
outside, the buffalo grass, and the wind in the night.

A wildcat sprang at Grandpa on the Fourth of July
when he was cutting plum bushes for fuel,
before Indians pulled the West over the edge of the sky.

To anyone who looked at us we said, "My friend";
liking the cut of a thought, we could say "Hello."
(But plain black hats rode the thoughts that made our code.)

The sun was over our town; it was like a blade.
Kicking cottonwood leaves we ran toward storms.
Wherever we looked the land would hold us up.

 

A Family Turn

All her Kamikaze friends admired my aunt,
their leader, charmed in vinegar,
a woman who could blaze with such white blasts
as Lawrence's that lit Arabia.
Her mean opinions bent her hatpins.

We'd take a ride in her old car
that ripped like Sherman through society:
Main Street's oases sheltered no one
when she pulled up at Thirty-first
and whirled that Ford for another charge.

We swept headlines from under rugs, names
all over town, which I learned her way, by heart,
and blazed with love that burns because it's real.
With a turn that's our family's own,
she'd say, "Our town is not the same"—

Pause—"And it's never been."



Topography
After we flew across the country we got in bed, laid our bodies delicately together, like maps laid face to face, East to West, my San Francisco against your New York, your Fire Island against my Sonoma, my  New Orleans deep in your Texas, your Idaho bright on my Great Lakes, my Kansas  burning against your Kansas your Kansas burning against my Kansas, your Eastern Standard Time pressing into my  Pacific Time, my Mountain Time beating against your Central Time, your  sun rising swiftly from the right my  sun rising swiftly from the left your  moon rising slowly from the left my  moon rising slowly from the right until  all four bodies of the sky burn above us, sealing us together,  all our cities twin cities,  all our states united, one  nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

The Race   
When I got to the airport I rushed up to the desk,  bought a ticket, ten minutes later  they told me the flight was cancelled, the doctors  had said my father would not live through the night  and the flight was cancelled. A young man  with a dark brown moustache told me  another airline had a nonstop  leaving in seven minutes. See that  elevator over there, well go  down to the first floor, make a right, you'll  see a yellow bus, get off at the  second Pan Am terminal, I  ran, I who have no sense of direction  raced exactly where he'd told me, a fish  slipping upstream deftly against  the flow of the river. I jumped off that bus with those  bags I had thrown everything into  in five minutes, and ran, the bags  wagged me from side to side as if  to prove I was under the claims of the material,  I ran up to a man with a flower on his breast,  I who always go to the end of the line, I said  Help me. He looked at my ticket, he said  Make a left and then a right, go up the moving stairs and then  run. I lumbered up the moving stairs,  at the top I saw the corridor,  and then I took a deep breath, I said  goodbye to my body, goodbye to comfort,  I used my legs and heart as if I would  gladly use them up for this,  to touch him again in this life. I ran, and the  bags banged against me, wheeled and coursed  in skewed orbits, I have seen pictures of  women running, their belongings tied  in scarves grasped in their fists, I blessed my  long legs he gave me, my strong  heart I abandoned to its own purpose,  I ran to Gate 17 and they were  just lifting the thick white  lozenge of the door to fit it into  the socket of the plane. Like the one who is not  too rich, I turned sideways and  slipped through the needle's eye, and then  I walked down the aisle toward my father. The jet  was full, and people's hair was shining, they were  smiling, the interior of the plane was filled with a  mist of gold endorphin light,  I wept as people weep when they enter heaven,  in massive relief. We lifted up  gently from one tip of the continent  and did not stop until we set down lightly on the  other edge, I walked into his room  and watched his chest rise slowly  and sink again, all night  I watched him breathe. 

Sex Without Love 
How do they do it, the ones who make love without love? Beautiful as dancers, gliding over each other like ice-skaters over the ice, fingers hooked inside each other's bodies, faces red as steak, wine, wet as the children at birth whose mothers are going to give them away. How do they come to the come to the come to the God come to the still waters, and not love the one who came there with them, light rising slowly as steam off their joined skin? These are the true religious, the purists, the pros, the ones who will not accept a false Messiah, love the priest instead of the God. They do not mistake the lover for their own pleasure, they are like great runners: they know they are alone with the road surface, the cold, the wind, the fit of their shoes, their over-all cardio- vascular health--just factors, like the partner in the bed, and not the truth, which is the single body alone in the universe against its own best time.
 
I Go Back to May 1937 
I see them standing at the formal gates of their colleges,  I see my father strolling out under the ochre sandstone arch, the  red tiles glinting like bent  plates of blood behind his head, I  see my mother with a few light books at her hip  standing at the pillar made of tiny bricks with the  wrought-iron gate still open behind her, its  sword-tips black in the May air, they are about to graduate, they are about to get married,  they are kids, they are dumb, all they know is they are innocent, they would never hurt anybody. I want to go up to them and say Stop,  don't do it—she's the wrong woman,  he's the wrong man, you are going to do things  you cannot imagine you would ever do,  you are going to do bad things to children, you are going to suffer in ways you never heard of,  you are going to want to die. I want to go  up to them there in the late May sunlight and say it, her hungry pretty blank face turning to me, her pitiful beautiful untouched body,  his arrogant handsome blind face turning to me, his pitiful beautiful untouched body, but I don't do it. I want to live. I  take them up like the male and female  paper dolls and bang them together  at the hips like chips of flint as if to  strike sparks from them, I say Do what you are going to do, and I will tell about it. 
 
What is the Earth?
The earth is a homeless person. Or the earth's home is the atmosphere. Or the atmosphere is the earth's clothing, layers of it, the earth wears all of it, the earth is a homeless person. Or the atmosphere is the earth's cocoon, which it spun itself, the earth is a larvum. Or the atmosphere is the earth's skin— earth, and atmostphere, one homeless one. Or its orbit is the earth's home, or the path of the orbit just a path, the earth, a homeless person. Or the gutter of the earth's orbit is a circle of hell, the circle of the homeless. But the earth has a place, around the fire, the hearth of our star, the earth is at home, the earth is home to the homeless. For food, and warmth, and shelter, and health, they have earth and fire and air and water, for home they have the elements they are made of, as if each homeless one were an earth, made of milk and grain, like Ceres, and one could eat oneself—as if the human were a god, who could eat the earth, a god of homelessness. 
 
  
High School Senior
For seventeen years, her breath in the house  at night, puff, puff, like summer  cumulus above her bed,  and her scalp smelling of apricots —this being who had formed within me,  squatted like a bright tree-frog in the dark,  like an eohippus she had come out of history  slowly, through me, into the daylight,  I had the daily sight of her,  like food or air she was there, like a mother.  I say "college," but I feel as if I cannot tell the difference between her leaving for college  and our parting forever—I try to see this house without her, without her pure  depth of feeling, without her creek-brown hair, her daedal hands with their tapered  fingers, her pupils dark as the mourning cloak's wing, but I can't. Seventeen years ago, in this room, she moved inside me, I looked at the river, I could not imagine  my life with her. I gazed across the street,  and saw, in the icy winter sun, a column of steam rush up away from the earth.  There are creatures whose children float away  at birth, and those who throat-feed their young for weeks and never see them again. My daughter  is free and she is in me—no, my love  of her is in me, moving in my heart,  changing chambers, like something poured  from hand to hand, to be weighed and then reweighed.
 
Take the I Out 
But I love the I, steel I-beam  that my father sold. They poured the pig iron  into the mold, and it fed out slowly,  a bending jelly in the bath, and it hardened,  Bessemer, blister, crucible, alloy, and he  marketed it, and bought bourbon, and Cream  of Wheat, its curl of butter right  in the middle of its forehead, he paid for our dresses  with his metal sweat, sweet in the morning  and sour in the evening. I love the I,  frail between its flitches, its hard ground  and hard sky, it soars between them  like the soul that rushes, back and forth,  between the mother and father. What if they had loved each other,  how would it have felt to be the strut  joining the floor and roof of the truss?  I have seen, on his shirt-cardboard, years  in her desk, the night they made me, the penciled  slope of her temperature rising, and on  the peak of the hill, first soldier to reach  the crest, the Roman numeral I— I, I, I, I,  girders of identity, head on,  embedded in the poem. I love the I  for its premise of existence—our I—when I was  born, part gelid, I lay with you  on the cooling table, we were all there, a  forest of felled iron. The I is a pine,  resinous, flammable root to crown,  which throws its cones as far as it can in a fire.
 
1954
Then dirt scared me, because of the dirt he had put on her face. And her training bra scared me—the newspapers, morning and evening, kept saying it, training bra, as if the cups of it had been calling the breasts up—he buried her in it, perhaps he had never bothered to take it off. They found her underpants in a garbage can. And I feared the word eczema, like my acne and like the X in the paper which marked her body, as if he had killed her for not being flawless. I feared his name, Burton Abbott, the first name that was a last name, as if he were not someone specific. It was nothing one could learn from his face. His face was dull and ordinary, it took away what I’d thought I could count on about evil. He looked thin and lonely, it was horrifying, he looked almost humble. I felt awe that dirt was so impersonal, and pity for the training bra, pity and terror of eczema. And I could not sit on my mother’s electric blanket anymore, I began to have a  fear of electricity— the good people, the parents, were going to fry him to death. This was what his parents had been telling us: Burton Abbott, Burton Abbott, death to the person, death to the home planet. The worst thing was to think of her, of what it had been to be her, alive, to be walked, alive, into that cabin, to look into those eyes, and see the human
 
Crab
When I eat crab, slide the rosy rubbery claw across my tongue I think of my mother. She'd drive down to the edge of the Bay, tiny woman in a huge car, she'd ask the crab-man to crack it for her. She'd stand and wait as the pliers broke those chalky homes, wild- red and knobby, those cartilage wrists, the thin orange roof of the back. I'd come home, and find her at the table crisply unhousing the parts, laying the fierce shell on one side, the soft body on the other. She gave us lots, because we loved it so much, so there was always enough, a mound of crab like a cross between breast-milk and meat. The back even had the shape of a perfect ruined breast, upright flakes white as the flesh of a chrysanthemum, but the best part was the claw, she'd slide it out so slowly the tip was unbroken, scarlet bulb of the feeler—it was such a kick to easily eat that weapon, wreck its delicate hooked pulp between palate and tongue. She loved to feed us and all she gave us was fresh, she was willing to grasp shell, membrane, stem, to go close to dirt and salt to feed us, the way she had gone near our father himself to give us life. I look back and see us dripping at the table, feeding, her row of pink eaters, the platter of flawless limp claws, I look back further and see her in the kitchen, shelling flesh, her small hands curled—she is like a fish-hawk, wild, tearing the meat deftly, living out her life of fear and desire. 
 
May 1968 
When the Dean said we could not cross campus until the students gave up the buildings, we lay down, in the street, we said the cops will enter this gate over us. Lying back on the cobbles, I saw the buildings of New York City from dirt level, they soared up and stopped, chopped off--above them, the sky, the night air over the island. The mounted police moved, near us, while we sang, and then I began to count, 12, 13, 14, 15, I counted again, 15, 16, one month since the day on that deserted beach, 17, 18, my mouth fell open, my hair on the street, if my period did not come tonight I was pregnant. I could see the sole of a cop's shoe, the gelding's belly, its genitals-- if they took me to Women's Detention and did the exam on me, the speculum, the fingers--I gazed into the horse's tail like a comet-train. All week, I had thought about getting arrested, half-longed to give myself away. On the tar-- one brain in my head, another, in the making, near the base of my tail-- I looked at the steel arc of the horse's shoe, the curve of its belly, the cop's nightstick, the buildings streaming up away from the earth. I knew I should get up and leave, but I lay there looking at the space above us, until it turned deep blue and then ashy, colorless, Give me this one night, I thought, and I'll give this child the rest of my life, the horse's heads, this time, drooping, dipping, until they slept in a circle around my body and my daughter 
 
One Year 
When I got to his marker, I sat on it, like sitting on the edge of someone's bed  and I rubbed the smooth, speckled granite. I took some tears from my jaw and neck and started to wash a corner of his stone. Then a black and amber ant ran out onto the granite, and off it, and another ant hauled a dead ant onto the stone, leaving it, and not coming back. Ants ran down into the grooves of his name and dates, down into the oval track of the  first name's O, middle name's O, the short O of his last name, and down into the hyphen between his birth and death--little trough of his life. Soft bugs appeared on my shoes, like grains of pollen, I let them move on me, I rinsed a dark fleck of mica, and down inside the engraved letters the first dots of lichen were appearing like stars in early evening. I saw the speedwell on the ground with its horns, the coiled ferns, copper-beech blossoms, each petal like that disc of matter which swayed, on the last day, on his tongue. Tamarack, Western hemlock, manzanita, water birch with its scored bark, I put my arms around a trunk and squeezed it, then I lay down on my father's grave. The sun shone down on me, the powerful ants walked on me. When I woke, my cheek was crumbly, yellowish  with a mustard plaster of earth. Only at the last minute did I think of his body actually under me, the can of  bone, ash, soft as a goosedown pillow that bursts in bed with the lovers. When I kissed his stone it was not enough, when I licked it my tongue went dry a moment, I  ate his dust, I tasted my dirt host.
 
Primitive 
I have heard about the civilized,  the marriages run on talk, elegant and honest, rational. But you and I are  savages. You come in with a bag,  hold it out to me in silence.  I know Moo Shu Pork when I smell it  and understand the message: I have  pleased you greatly last night. We sit  quietly, side by side, to eat,  the long pancakes dangling and spilling,  fragrant sauce dripping out,  and glance at each other askance, wordless,  the corners of our eyes clear as spear points  laid along the sill to show  a friend sits with a friend here. 
 
The Victims 
When Mother divorced you, we were glad. She took it and took it in silence, all those years and then kicked you out, suddenly, and her kids loved it. Then you were fired, and we grinned inside, the way people grinned when Nixon's helicopter lifted off the South Lawn for the last time. We were tickled to think of your office taken away,  your secretaries taken away,  your lunches with three double bourbons,  your pencils, your reams of paper. Would they take your suits back, too, those dark carcasses hung in your closet, and the black noses of your shoes with their large pores?  She had taught us to take it, to hate you and take it until we pricked with her for your  annihilation, Father. Now I pass the bums in doorways, the white slugs of their bodies gleaming through slits in their suits of compressed silt, the stained flippers of their hands, the underwater fire of their eyes, ships gone down with the lanterns lit, and I wonder who took it and  took it from them in silence until they had given it all away and had nothing  left but this. 
 
The Pope's Penis 
It hangs deep in his robes, a delicate clapper at the center of a bell. It moves when he moves, a ghostly fish in a halo of silver sweaweed, the hair swaying in the dark and the heat -- and at night while his eyes sleep, it stands up in praise of God.
 
The Space Heater 
On the then-below-zero day, it was on, near the patients' chair, the old heater kept by the analyst's couch, at the end, like the infant's headstone that was added near the foot of my father's grave. And it was hot, with the almost laughing satire of a fire's heat, the little coils like hairs in Hell. And it was making a group of sick noises- I wanted the doctor to turn it off but I couldn't seem to ask, so I just stared, but it did not budge. The doctor turned his heavy, soft palm outward, toward me, inviting me to speak, I said, "If you're cold-are you cold? But if it's on  for me..." He held his palm out toward me, I tried to ask, but I only muttered, but he said, "Of course," as if I had asked, and he stood up and approached the heater, and then stood on one foot, and threw himself toward the wall with one hand, and with the other hand reached down, behind the couch, to pull the plug out. I looked away, I had not known he would have to bend like that. And I was so moved, that he would act undignified, to help me, that I cried, not trying to stop, but as if the moans made sentences which bore some human message. If he would cast himself toward the outlet for me, as if bending with me in my old shame and horror, then I would rest on his art-and the heater purred, like a creature or the familiar of a creature, or the child of a familiar, the father of a child, the spirit of a father, the healing of a spirit, the vision of healing, the heat of vision, the power of heat, the pleasure of power. 

  The Slash 
The first ones were attached to my dress at the waist, one on either side, right at the point where hands could clasp you and pick you up, as if you were a hot squeeze bottle of tree syrup, and the sashes that emerged like axil buds from the angles of the waist were used to play horses, that racing across the cement while someone held your reins and you could feel your flesh itself in your body wildly streaming. You would come home, a torn-off sash dangling from either hand, a snake-charmer— each time, she sewed them back on with thicker thread, until the seams of sash and dress bulged like little knots of gristle at your waist as you walked, you could feel them like thumbs pressing into your body. The next sash was the one Thee, Hannah! borrowed from her be-ribboned friend and hid in a drawer and got salve on it, salve on a sash, like bacon grease on a snake, God's lard on the ribbon a Quaker girl should not want, Satan's jism on silk delicate as the skin of a young girl's genital. When Hannah gave up satin her father told her she was beautiful just as God made her. But all sashes lead to the sash, very sash of very sash, begotten, not made, that my aunt sent from Switzerland— cobalt ripple of Swiss cotton with clean boys and girls dancing on it. I don't know why my mother chose it to tie me to the chair with, her eye just fell on it, but the whole day I felt those blue children dance around my wrists. Later someone told me they had found out the universe is a kind of strip that twists around and joins itself, and I believe it, sometimes I can feel it, the way we are pouring slowly toward a curve and around it through something dark and soft, and we are bound to each other.    


The Mortal One 
Three months after he lies dead, that long yellow narrow body, not like Christ but like one of his saints, the naked ones in the paintings whose bodies are done in gilt, all knees and raw ribs, the ones who died of nettles, bile, the one who died roasted over a slow fire— three months later I take the pot of tulip bulbs out of the closet and set it on the table and take off the foil hood. The shoots stand up like young green pencils, and there in the room is the comfortable smell of rot, the bulb that did not make it, marked with ridges like an elephant's notched foot, I walk down the hall as if I were moving through the long stem of the tulip toward the closed sheath. In the kitchen I throw a palmful of peppercorns into the saucepan as if I would grow a black tree from the soup, I throw out the rotten chicken part, glad again that we burned my father before one single bloom of mold could grow up out of him, maybe it had begun in his bowels but we burned his bowels the way you burn the long blue scarf of the dead, and all their clothing, cleansing with fire. How fast time goes now that I'm happy, now that I know how to think of his dead body every day without shock, almost without grief, to take it into each part of the day the way a loom parts the vertical threads, half to the left half to the right like the Red Sea and you throw the shuttle through with the warp-thread attached to the feet, that small gold figure of my father— how often I saw him in paintings and did not know him, the tiny naked dead one in the corner, the mortal one. 
 
The Daughter Goes to Camp 
In the taxi alone, home from the airport, I could not believe you were gone. My palm kept creeping over the smooth plastic to find your strong meaty little hand and squeeze it, find your narrow thigh in the noble ribbing of the corduroy, straight and regular as anything in nature, to find the slack cool cheek of a child in the heat of a summer morning— nothing, nothing, waves of bawling hitting me in hot flashes like some change of life, some boiling wave rising in me toward your body, toward where it should have been on the seat, your brow curved like a cereal bowl, your eyes dark with massed crystals like the magnified scales of a butterfly's wing, the delicate feelers of your limp hair, floods of blood rising in my face as I tried to reassemble the hot gritty molecules in the car, to make you appear like a holograph on the back seat, pull you out of nothing as I once did—but you were really gone, the cab glossy as a slit caul out of which you had slipped, the air glittering electric with escape as it does in the room at a birth. 
  The Arrivals
I pull the bed slowly open, I open the lips of the bed, get the stack of fresh underpants out of the suitcase—peach, white, cherry, quince, pussy willow, I choose a color and put them on, I travel with the stack for the stack's caress, dry and soft. I enter the soft birth-lips of the bed, take off my glasses, and the cabbage-roses on the curtain blur to Keats's peonies, the ochre willow holds a cloud the way a skeleton holds flesh and it passes, does not hold it. The bed fits me like a walnut shell its meat, my hands touch the upper corners, the lower, my feet. It is so silent I hear the choirs of wild silence, the maenads of the atoms. Is this what it feels like to have a mother? The sheets are heavy cream, whipped. Ah, here is my mother, or rather here she is not, so this is paradise. But surely that was paradise, when her Jell-O nipple was the size of my own fist, in front of my face—out of its humped runkles those several springs of milk, so fierce almost fearsome. What did I think in that brain gridded for thought, its cups loaded with languageless rennet? And at night, when they timed me, four hours of screaming, not a minute more, four, those quatrains of icy yell, then the cold tap water to get me over my shameless hunger, what was it like to be there when that hunger was driven into my structure at such heat it alloyed that iron? Where have I been while this person is leading my life with her patience, will and order? In the garden; on the bee and under the bee; in the crown gathering cumulus and flensing it from the boughs, weeping a rehearsal for the rotting and casting off of our flesh, the year we slowly throw it off like clothing by the bed covers of our lover, and dive under. 
 
The Borders
To say that she came into me, from another world, is not true. Nothing comes into the universe and nothing leaves it. My mother—I mean my daughter did not enter me. She began to exist inside me—she appeared within me. And my mother did not enter me. When she lay down, to pray, on me, she was always ferociously courteous, fastidious with Puritan fastidiousness, but the barrier of my skin failed, the barrier of my body fell, the barrier of my spirit. She aroused and magnetized my skin, I wanted ardently to please her, I would say to her what she wanted to hear, as if I were hers. I served her willingly, and then became very much like her, fiercely out for myself. When my daughter was in me, I felt I had a soul in me. But it was born with her. But when she cried, one night, such pure crying, I said I will take care of you, I will put you first. I will not ever have a daughter the way she had me, I will not ever swim in you the way my mother swam in me and I felt myself swum in. I will never know anyone again the way I knew my mother, the gates of the human fallen.
 The Clasp 
She was four, he was one, it was raining, we had colds, we had been in the apartment two weeks straight, I grabbed her to keep her from shoving him over on his face, again, and when I had her wrist in my grasp I compressed it, fiercely, for a couple of seconds, to make an impression on her, to hurt her, our beloved firstborn, I even almost savored the stinging sensation of the squeezing, the expression, into her, of my anger, "Never, never, again," the righteous chant accompanying the clasp. It happened very fast-grab, crush, crush, crush, release-and at the first extra force, she swung her head, as if checking who this was, and looked at me, and saw me-yes, this was her mom, her mom was doing this. Her dark, deeply open eyes took me in, she knew me, in the shock of the moment she learned me. This was her mother, one of the two whom she most loved, the two who loved her most, near the source of love  was this.
 
The End 
 
The Pact
We played dolls in that house where Father staggered with the Thanksgiving knife, where Mother wept at noon into her one ounce of cottage cheese, praying for the strength not to kill herself. We kneeled over the rubber bodies, gave them baths carefully, scrubbed their little orange hands, wrapped them up tight, said goodnight, never spoke of the woman like a gaping wound weeping on the stairs, the man like a stuck buffalo, baffled, stunned, dragging arrows in his side. As if we had made a pact of silence and safety, we kneeled and dressed those tiny torsos with their elegant belly-buttons and minuscule holes high on the buttock to pee through and all that darkness in their open mouths, so that I have not been able to forgive you for giving your daughter away, letting her go at eight as if you took Molly Ann or Tiny Tears and held her head under the water in the bathinette until no bubbles rose, or threw her dark rosy body on the fire that burned in that house where you and I barely survived, sister, where we swore to be protectors.
 

A Week Later

A week later, I said to a friend: I don't think I could ever write about it. Maybe in a year I could write something. There is something in me maybe someday to be written; now it is folded, and folded, and folded, like a note in school. And in my dream someone was playing jacks, and in the air there was a huge, thrown, tilted jack on fire. And when I woke up, I found myself counting the days since I had last seen my husband--only two years, and some weeks, and hours. We had signed the papers and come down to the ground floor of the Chrysler Building, the intact beauty of its lobby around us like a king's tomb, on the ceiling the little painted plane, in the mural, flying. And it entered my strictured heart, this morning, slightly, shyly as if warily, untamed, a greater sense of the sweetness and plenty of his ongoing life, unknown to me, unseen by me, unheard, untouched-but known, seen, heard, touched. And it came to me, for moments at a time, moment after moment, to be glad for him that he is with the one he feels was meant for him. And I thought of my mother, minutes from her death, eighty-five years from her birth, the almost warbler bones of her shoulder under my hand, the eggshell skull, as she lay in some peace in the clean sheets, and I could tell her the best of my poor, partial love, I could sing her out with it, I saw the luck and luxury of that hour.
  Japanese-American Farmhouse, California, 1942
Everything has been taken that anyone thought worth taking. The stairs are tilted, scattered with sycamore leaves curled like ammonites in inland rock. Wood shows through the paint on the frame and the door is open--an empty room, sunlight on the floor. All that is left on the porch is the hollow cylinder of an Albert's Quick Oats cardboard box and a sewing machine. Its extraterrestrial head is bowed, its scrolled neck glistens. I was born, that day, near there, in wartime, of ignorant people. 
 

Your's, Kindly 

Because I felt too weak to move you kindly moved for me, kneeling and turning, until you could take my breast-tip in the socket of your lips; and my womb went down  on itself, drew sharply over and over to its tightest shape, the way, when newborns nurse, the fist of the uterus with each, milk, tug, powerfully shuts. I saw your hand, near me, your daily hand, your thumbnail, the quiet ordinary self, when your mouth at my breast was drawing sweet gashes of come up from my womb made black fork-flashes of a  celibate's lust shoot through me. And I couldn't lift my head, and you swiveled, and came down close to me, delicate blunt touch of your hard penis in long  caresses down my face, species happiness, calm which gleams with fearless anguished desire. It found my pouring mouth, the back of my throat, and the bright wall which opens. It seemed to take us hours to move the bone creatures so their gods could be fitted to each other, and then, at last, home, root in the earth, wing in the air. As it finished, it seemed my sex was a grey flower the color of the brain, smooth and glistening, a complex calla or iris which you  were creating with the errless digit of your sex. But then, as it finished again, one could not speak of a blossom, or the blossom  was stripped away, as if, until that moment, the cunt had been clothed, still, in the thinnest garment, and now was bare or more than bare, silver wet-suit of  matter itself gone, nothing there but the paradise flay. And then more, that cannot be told — may be, but cannot be, things that did not have to do with me, as if some  wires crossed, and history or war, or the witches possessed, or the end of life were happening in me, or as if  I were in a borrowed body, I knew what I could not know, did — was done to — what I cannot-do-be-done-to, so when  we returned, I cried, afraid for a moment I was dead, and had got my wish to come back, once, and sleep with you, on a summer afternoon, in an empty house where no one could hear us. I lowered the salt breasts of my eyes to your lips, and you sucked, then I looked at your face, at its absence of unkindness, its giving that absence off as a matter I cannot name, as if I was seeing not you but something between us, that can live only between us. I stroked back the hair in pond and sex rivulets from your forehead, gently raked it back along your scalp, I did not think of my father's hair in death, those oiled paths, I lay along your length and did not think how he did not love me, how he trained me not to be loved.



Dishwater

 Slap of the screen door, flat knock
of my grandmother’s boxy black shoes
on the wooden stoop, the hush and sweep
of her knob-kneed, cotton-aproned stride
out to the edge and then, toed in
with a furious twist and heave,
a bridge that leaps from her hot red hands
and hangs there shining for fifty years
over the mystified chickens,
over the swaying nettles, the ragweed,
the clay slope down to the creek,
over the redwing blackbirds in the tops
of the willows, a glorious rainbow
with an empty dishpan swinging at one end.

                             
PORCH SWING IN SEPTEMBER
 The porch swing hangs fixed in a morning sun
that bleaches its gray slats, its flowered cushion
whose flowers have faded, like those of summer,
and a small brown spider has hung out her webs
on a line between porch post and chain
so that no one may swing without breaking it.
She is saying it’s time that the swinging were done with,
time that the creaking and pinging and popping
that sang through the ceiling were past,
time now for the soft vibrations of moths,
the wasp tapping each board for an entrance,
the cool dewdrops to brush from her work
every morning, one world at a time.      


A Room in the Past 

It’s a kitchen. Its curtains fill 
with a morning light so bright 
you can’t see beyond its windows 
into the afternoon. A kitchen 
falling through time with its things 
in their places, the dishes jingling 
up in the cupboard, the bucket 



Cuba, 1962 
When the rooster jumps up on the windowsill  and spreads his red-gold wings,  I wake, thinking it is the sun  and call Juanita, hearing her answer,  but only in my mind.  I know she is already outside,  breaking the cane off at ground level,  using only her big hands.  I get the machete and walk among the cane,  until I see her, lying face-down in the dirt. 
Juanita, dead in the morning like this.  I raise the machete— what I take from the earth, I give back— and cut off her feet.  I lift the body and carry it to the wagon,  where I load the cane to sell in the village.  Whoever tastes my woman in his candy, his cake,  tastes something sweeter than this sugar cane;  it is grief.  If you eat too much of it, you want more,  you can never get enough.    
 The Anniversary 
You raise the ax,  the block of wood screams in half,  while I lift the sack of flour  and carry it into the house.  I'm not afraid of the blade  you've just pointed at my head.  If I were dead, you could take the boy,  hunt, kiss gnats, instead of my moist lips.  Take it easy, squabs are roasting,  corn, still in husks, crackles,  as the boy dances around the table:  old guest at a wedding party for two sad-faced clowns,  who together, never won a round of anything but hard times.  Come in, sheets are clean,  fall down on me for one more year  and we can blast another hole in ourselves without a sound. 

The Country Midwife:  A Day 


The fine delight that fathers thought; the strong 
Spur, live and lancing like the blowpipe flame, 
Breathes once and, quenchèd faster than it came, 
Leaves yet the mind a mother of immortal song. 
Nine months she then, nay years, nine years she long 
Within her wears, bears, cares and combs the same: 
The widow of an insight lost she lives, with aim 
Now known and hand at work now never wrong. 
  Sweet fire the sire of muse, my soul needs this; 
I want the one rapture of an inspiration. 
O then if in my lagging lines you miss 
the roll, the rise, the carol, the creation, 
My winter world, that scarcely breathes that bliss 
Now, yields you, with some sighs, our explanation. 


No worst, there is none. Pitched past pitch of grief, 
More pangs will, schooled at forepangs, wilder wring. 
Comforter, where, where is your comforting? 
Mary, mother of us, where is your relief? 
My cries heave, herds-long; huddle in a main, a chief 
Woe, world-sorrow; on an age-old anvil wince and sing -- 
Then lull, then leave off. Fury had shrieked "No ling- 
ering! Let me be fell: force I must be brief". 
   O the mind, mind has mountains; cliffs of fall 
Frightful, sheer, no-man-fathomed. Hold them cheap 
May who ne'er hung there. Nor does long our small 
Durance deal with that steep or deep. Here! creep, 
Wretch, under a comfort serves in a whirlwind: all 
Life death does end and each day dies with sleep. 


It was a hard thing to undo this knot. 
The rainbow shines but only in the thought 
Of him that looks. Yet not in that alone, 
For who makes rainbows by invention? 
And many standing round a waterfall 
See one bow each, yet not the same to all, 
But each a hand's breadth further than the next. 
The sun on falling waters writes the text 
Which yet is in the eye or in the thought. 
It was a hard thing to undo this knot.

 His rifle scrawled in his lap 
 Horrid eyes in an awful cave

 I have suffered forty years
 Times manifold like the Swans mingling 

 Cold as the puzzled Wind
 Where the ships beat away

 For I am not here 
 And I do not pretend 

                       


Stout Fields Next to a Butterfly 
Philosophy's Strangled Neck       

 Contrived to mix eternity,
  conceiving to unite careless 
  murder, salacious and vapid science 
  and to leave thirst, heart-piercing 
  strong and deserted, snowblue in granary dust 

         



At The Last 

 I felt a kind of writing
             in the heart 

 I found the one who made me 
 years ago, thinking of dust

 I gathered my dissolved dreams, 
 and hid patience in this book.






                                                                                                                       
Goddamn Winged 

 Hurts are a perfect ending 
 For the vacancy of years.

 So in fixed light and silence 
 And the numb flack of July

 Mothers of each family 
 Drag a law toward old men 

 As they decide on the graves 
 for us human potatoes 


          



O We are Reptiles 


I dance now in the the old lagoon, 
 plow the driveway, look and blow out air, 
 gnaw a great breeze, dark and
 wild as the yawning 
 years, while my many little children, 
 seditious, make jewelry water.

Peep 

 watch him watching the gray 
 morning over a hermit river
 
      



 Deep in a deadwood pool 
           source shakes. 
 
 Euripides' gods will die!

 Even as time-mama-phanic stars 
      taunt paths with pinwheeling 
                  statistical loops. 


                         



After Months of Kneaded Ratios 
 
 
 Hundred-year-old avocados,
      feed the hammer knife 
 deliciously captured blood


                  



 We scaled the ochre darkness 
 tracing green reeds over the corkscrew hills 
                along dim blue limbs of light. 

 Each at every block of the prayer
  planted an eye to see the cradle:

				        a peacock on a pillow, 
			      a tongue under a frozen sky.


               



Lost As Silences 

 Start from the country, a sorrow
  weed that bends a postcard dark. 
 
 It's one more excellent foolish 
  fire to die from. 

 Attractively, its heart-honored flames, 
  call on bellies to protect circulation.


                                                                                                                       
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I open 
 my dark eyes
 abhorring my life.





     


Quiet -- 

 
 Recall this world, 
  have no hope to endure. 

 It's then so eloquent
  as if a book


                                                                                                                       
 

 Pan Moves Erratically Over a Different Bridge


 He waited, much rapturous over the world, 
 hoping the sun's scarce writing on a clouded lake 
                     might spell birds or mermaids.


 And he can't remember how to make 
  the flawed arguments of names 
                  into separation.


                      



 That day the artist-god: a half-dead entity
			 enormous, arrived ermine-bright
			                    full of rust

 Sadness kept reflecting intelligence, valerian 
   wrinkling water, the studded horned doorways, 
                         rolling dry upon rocks. 


                 



Concealed 

			 wolves. 
			 avaricious.

 sparsely placing translation-bracken thorn
  fatigue-smoking fingertips behind ash-gray 
             zealous whole-flour purgatories


                


 With the fierce light
 Of a great strangering
 Imagination entered a lazy sky. 
 
 Real air 
 Circled the hub. 


                  


 Calm, back-lit in the brain,
 considered praise or fear stems. 
 
 As a brown hawk draws in granite, 
 surely, finally, flirtatiously

 Weary apprentices stare
 at pools pale with scum.


                                                                                                                       


I earned the blue light 
 It was my happy surge, my song 
 I drew the glass, met your eyes
 trembled, and said: "By you ..." 

       




Dinosaurs 

 honeyed grief

 the last cloud 




                



Dinna Levertov 
Waits for you
With an anatomical truth
Suspended in Green jelly. 
 
 

 


She unwrapped love, 
  yes, so familiar: 
 
 Mildew, pigeons, shrubbery, 
  death! An enticing devotion:

 Silent conviction sponge 
  the line between bodies. 
 
          


 
 I am continuous:
  anticipating midnight incessant, 
  blushing truths,

 Boulders 
  doodling deepening
  causes to sing 
 
 A sweet cliff
  to extend over. 
 

         




Gagging Eve

time wriggled off alone 
 past the schadenfreude 
   celebration of those unheard

 The milky labor of a rainbow: 
 life-giving clumps of empty inscriptions.

 Laughing willow-vicious
 fluffy reproachful precedents 
 
 Destroy 52% of truth.



                



And when the head dwells in the green 
 gutters and moves that horizon 
 where the body wanders 
 and the stones are blocked with
 the long bones that anchor the sun, 
    the heart, and its rider, gleam. 
 
 
                                                                                                                       
 
 
 
 
 
 In the loss of the hope of what 
  it is to take in this morning 

 The storm or the stream 
  where no one will look

 I have wandered so much seeking 
 peace, -constantly dissatisfied

 accepting noise as madness, rejecting 
 the war faith, glistening naugahyde

 'Tis time to curse this day 
     since the world's bliss is in me, 
     and the world is lonely. 
 

                                                                                                                       
 
 


 
 
 Sonnet 
 
 
 My heart is behind me, the wind turns to 
 Shadow on the fallen grass. I have thought 
 Something alone with my reason as it 
 Sits in the cold stream eating raving hints 
 Cleaned in the springs of the mixed ibises.
 Every stone a breast, a subjection
 Which can never lighten this scar loan mouth. 
 A note swimming awake through dead polite 
 Delight. Such soft ripe accents of spirit gain 
 Enough lechery to veil the canker 
 Trivia. Restraint! Random temptation!
 Consummation uprisen from leafmould,
 Wanders self-denial protoplasm.

 the brink repeats up and down as it loves

  drawn from nature's  latest  dream 
 illuminates the edge of these fervors like 
  a thoughtless poet 
            

 because this world is the end 
 there is room 
 for old age 
                    



 Where cruelty and gristle whisper 
  tiresome grief infantalises dead 
  cursed creation, perennial 
      and stubborn as a lock.


               





 Think of the grave as a wall
    anarchy crafts from flesh

 The gloss of a kennel 
    with sky for feet 




    





Order? 


 the sap is done with the wounded 
  and just the soul 
 is down

 I know what I say 
  to my heart 



                                                                                                                       
 
 
 
 
 
 
 loose in tender fields 
      on the glossy lawn 
  she would drop the dark

 and in the field of the field
  complement returning with a fearless wing!

 Now we say it is as if the bells dropped out 
   as if the humming lights are beating 
   nascent heads sequestered everywhere

 Nantucket light, the wind-like splitter wings 
   bent, the lashes and the face bent, 
   and the trial bent in bed 
	 
	    bees and angel 
	      make assured poets
	      				bent




                                                                                                                       




She goes inside the window for me 
  to brush the hidden land


   






		       This morning gentle rain 
		    tongues light frosty snares 
	   snaking thru tinctured sentences.

  Hollowness comes, curdling to scatter
            longing intervals connected 
  by climax. Idle, gone, a future caged

	 swoons inhaling someone's story, a 
	  wanderer dazzled by rolling light.

	     veiled in a fog of moons 

                                                                                                                       
 

 Tanned  Saran-Wrapped Time
 Striated with Unadventures
 
                 



Uncomforted we hid our volutions
  in Marley's perished factories.

 Ode to Winter 
 
 
 The winds in the summer 
 Are too small 
 To have a vision 
 Of the future 
 
 The clock of such
 Happy streams stain 
 Rainbows onto dark walls
 
 
 
 
 
 
                   




Remote Fires Rumble 


 ========|======== convolvulus 
 flinging up destruction here!

 Intravenous drums!
 Petulant visitors!
 Unlicensed scorn! 

 Furnished with horror.

 Good-bye.


                                                                                                                       

           





 
 And as the long, curling cage of night turns blue, 
 its slanting blossoms fall in slow brandy breezes, 
 Driving the hills from spring to that same ground, 
 Where moss slipping on the whole swell of the sea 
 Taught my heavy life how to fill trees, with song. 
 





                                                                                                                       




 And in the morning I pull on my hands 
 and look in the rooms of light.


 Photons are very cold 
 And they carry out 
 Days that are poor 
 That know nothing 
 and think words beautiful. 
	 

	 The sky is our heart.
	 The mountains our head.




                        



 I realize that in a way,  
 what lives in the world, 
 lives in misfortune 
	 
	 in a sea, alone, 
	 mirrored, hidden 
	       by process.



                                                                                                                       








Lavish is the Forgotten Lullabye Skiff

And Down

 I looked in the nursery 
		 searched behind 
		 mother's breath 

 
  + 


 In my earliest room, 
 I was the wind in the swamp, 
 A wind hung with blue shadows, 
 The sun came to me. 
 
 


                                                                                                                       



 In that garden, arms forgave
 the fermentation of seclusion

            



 No one is sure how the world knows 

               

                                                                                                  
Undinal

 adage, envyings,

 Well what is it, that which is the soul?

	 
	 Surely none of the ground:
	  filled with its own love and plans; 
	  the dreamt pleasures of the day 
	  more silent wins on the battleground 
	  of pendant and ominous squid

	 
 And maybe not even the bones of women 
  sturdily creeping past pastoral quiet

 Nor the mineral of some future's 
  dim soil, its spiral shadows
  flinched from an ancient obelisk

 Nor a ring in the field 
  a flower reaching 
  about the thin curled sun

 Nor the hours gestating in an oak 
  stained & sleeping in eternal height 
 
 Nor the flick of a naked shrine 
  in the shadow of our blood

 Nor the solitude of engines
  handcuffed in eggs 
 

	 I throw on a golden-crowned ark 
	  a parliament of languor spruce, 
	  and snorting thug-soup
	  save a spool of realization 
	  a convenient despondence
	  designated as incredible.

I Knelt Upon 

 the way to that last promising difference:  
 craggie sacrum torn, sobbing, behind the milk 
 of mouth, beyond the stink of this world.

                                                                                                                       
 



 Alone, among the voiceless 
 Aware of being the precision of happiness 
 A strong reflection of light made fluent 

 Bearing those whose own human glee can never 
 Bear a stranger's smile, or an animal 
 Who holds the centre of the dry knots

 With a living scream 
 In the freakish evening 
 Of your swamp 
 
 An ungraspable 
 All wanders
 On drunken terms

 Singing lazily 
 Of an exit 
 From racist slough

 Lord of the Flowers I Love


 The luminous well wilded presences 
  peacefully, all night, working 
  the weak sounds, and the mountains 
  with their fingers in the sky, and 
  the flash of orchards swaying into snow 
  as flowing beige silhouettes. 
 
 Long after that year when we met 
  light escaping the river wind, 
		  lived every morning 
		  in time's completion.

 The moon on the roots of an unfinished shaft

 where we have been, and each other 
 own a good world to tell




                 






 Hurricanes, narrating
 concussions, wrinkle

 On cool weekends 
 old pills, at meals, 
 stroll over stubble. 

 And in the veins 
 between lives,
 faces catch in

 If we do not love 
 ourselves, completing

 That this heart is a certain smile of 
  an old old innocence bathing in the sea

 Wanting In One Abandoned Phrase

 
 To you I held the horizon.

 But the dying angel, 
 which I feared,
 went first to you.

 What I want, I am. 



                 




 
 I'm happy! I'm a tangled meme 
 trampling untranslatable 
 monstrous persistence. 

 I don't taste the names
 Of the prayers increasing inside my eyes. 

 My streets lead toward an empty restaurant;
 Walking plum north, I am laughing diamonds.

In The Fist Of A Dry Problem

 
 That solid elegy movement, that is this 
 one in two, each lip, travelling to the next, 
 a brain, trimming the bled wheels 
 of peril, or regret, arranging  
 the unknown inside, tuned to a shred 
 of swollen smoke, feeding to grow.
 



                



 And now the lights 
  marry the fish, 
 And I'm happy, having fun, 
 On this blustering day 
 Carrying the grafts of the drums, 
 To the Whiskey-Whizzgigs oil-permeated 
 Formal Medici account; easing to rest 
 Within the leper's world.

 I take courage from my bed. 
 I do not breathe.
 
 I listen to the light. 
 Heart creeps into eye.

 Roaring with song, 
 Hands in the ditch. 
 
 To the grave, I say, 
 To hear feathers tread.

 And then the hour's art

 And from what friends are not long gone,

 With gold wings, photogenic 
 Love flying down 
 As I turn and turn.

   guiding progress.

Thirty Years 

 No one could say
 I do not care.
 
 Infinite time, waking! Yet,
 What hurts me most is the last moment.

	  as her bowels

 the manifold frost before summer
 the sky like a flower 
 the lines on the ground where the gulls are

 & the wind that rises to keep 
 the green water prodigal





                  




And Grandfather's

 bathed in kindness,

 concave, uneasy, screaming, quenched

You Tell Me

Peas
 on the windowsill
 green and very young. 
 
 The bosom of the Creator is sad. 

 Morning is shattered by some festival 
   that only Love will find. 


   





Eyes keep clouds under bricks.

 And things 
   have long been 
  the same as they are now, 
   days are the same as any other days, 
      and souls are eager to know love.

As Made in Dreams 


 Music suspends the agony of words. 
 Reason slams, far away, into the back of the sun.
 Delight releases fangs to guide nowhere. 

 A riddled playground
 Covers the frame. 
 
 Weathered masks
 Become shelters.




      




 On this great night 
 I must write from you! 
 
 Give a world in which 
 I do not need to be.

 Let myself be invisible, 
 No more than a dumb image.

 My heart bright 
 Like a sad 
 Broken ember. 
 



                                                                                                                       
 




 Phrenologist's Intramural Tubing Nirvana

 taxicab, tidal 
 weeknights, hurricanes

 pivot-bidding foxglove-beautiful 
 pre-spring taper parkway-gliding 
                  groves where sex stipples me. 

 A kept shudder carcass embalming depth.

Perhaps each shadow 
 in your shoulders 
  shortcutting fire,

 jettisoned hot dreams

 I thought I was a place too astonishing to read.
 I lived in the mirror in the middle of my heart.

 I stretched the spools of my hands; I mapped time, 
 retrieved a blade of blood from a hissing dark. 
 
 I saw nothing.



                                                                                                                       





The Measured Wish

     aspired to meaning, a meadow 
          poured on starving flames,

     a quilt of secret somber flesh, its sugar 
    coinciding with something found 
 
 and when it laughs 
 driving thru the night, deodorized
  hopes swinging from the rear-view 
   gather cold sudden uncertainties. 
 
 
 
 
  
            


 my pillow on my hip 
 not my hip in my hands
 
               



I am born in the dark

 called into flesh 
 to slaughter death 

 a country that smells of dreams 
 children that eat the words of hired worms



             





 I thought to myself: this might be 
 a nice way to be healthily buried 
 in a contemplation of speech.

 Each day, light wakes, still, bewildered,

 And all that is absolute is restored
 In that vigor of your human body. 

 A temporary floating kettle fragrance
 Born to bite, tie shoes, and calibrate time.

 A hearth as large as an ancient empire, 
 An artist trash-pile seeking a goddess.

 A console owned by love and death, a mad 
 Being reaching through fear to resilience.









                                                                                                                       
 



 Her husband shouted holding his child 
  sped sharply to the door 
  on the ice dropped her baby.
 
 Her brother struck her, and missed,
  then held her, and took her
  back, haunted.

 Is one way to pull the best word 
 From an agitated silent heart land 
 
 For the soul is a kind of singing of 
 The fact itself, changing its view 
 
 A curve of jubilance and lace 
 Carving a jagged fallen sky

 o, thick ponderous quadriplegic 
 you were a natural glorious

 hoping virgin-choir bully 
 undressed remembrance bliss scree, 
 flitting AT&SF between amores.






                                                                                                                       







 And in the deep cities of the morning 
 I know that walls are nothing but light. 
 
 Morning clutches its nets in the heart 
 Birds entangled in the secret of its face.




 
               







Bloody Salvador

 youthful guts can kill 
 the phagocytic swelling 
 surface glistening villains

 the final past 
 snow pungent detail 
 that waiting remains 
 between queeck, hymnal, 
 Alcazar communicating
 Norumbega floating day

    ahimsa slaughter mines 




           








Celebrator Baths 
 beat; blackbirds Bacchae me
 Pindaric space traffic concubine

 forced to racks Sears 
 Search Ardis, aloof,  
 ostensibly to tie Ajax

 Big rang, 
 face-down 

 with dirty divining beans 
 discarded and bald in the pathway 
 tickling incomplete word-spouts

 In the darkest sun

 Winter retrieved
        one dense broken
      pale, seething carcass

 Atonement's peeling promulgation
       precipice free-glittering 
  tremulous armour wretchedness

 The violent heart-broken groans of 
        chaos caulking farewell's 
       crumbling approximations.





                                                                                                                       







 Then the sun washes the terrace 
 As if there were flowers in my hands 
 And my heart tears off my eyes.

 Society had to turn 
 in the mud among sharp branches
 brute wind was shining in it like
 an injured streambed, a pill-popping fog,
 an unblinking corona staring at a silhouette

The Lines of the Family 
 
 in some seasons we fight, 
 and have to stretch for a guidebook 
 
 wild forest cedars catching 
 cavernous eruptional 
 menacing sunlight, sipping rain 
 for faint fingers of information 








DARKNESS 

 
 is that instinct
 to eat uncertainty
 
 uniforms subject 
 to contradiction 
 
 dead doubts breaking









my hand
scented 
by the sculpture of you

 you, who 
 have peace 

 while for me, hell ascends 
 to settle around the street 
 a sun broken by the morning








 

 what will be done 
 let's make it she
 
 till she cupping 
 an uncontrollable
 alder 
 
 shows him 
 the her 
 in which 
 children 
 will









PLAY 

 
 he lay at her knees 
 and used a smile 
 to tie her hair










hypothetical lilies 
are no way  to care












 i love you for such artless
 steps at my door, like a bee 
 inside a dress, seeking milk 











 men all fear 
    the flesh

 and yet on weekend's torn nights
 after the hydrangea settle
 realize mind's moist transcendence










 
 those steps dreamt 
 
 of a regular gesture 
 of acid tracing a base

 ephemeral ills aching
 as flames in the silt










placed in an ocean 
that sways beneath a confused 
and ungraspable light


	   a map 
	   becomes 
	   an anchor
 







answers beat 
up questions







filtered
subtle animals
with sunny dispossessions 
 
 delight
 in the swamp weather 
 of this generation
 
 smell the former
 rough treasure
 dispenser 

 touch smouldering
 dreary willow's 
 radiant notes 









family troubles
 seeking micro redemption 

 elegantly unannounce 
  pre-determined acts










nothing awakens
the withered mist

its violins dreaming of cauliflower trees, 
the shape of redwoods, a river wandering

 it passes again everywhere 
 sharp lines of cellophane

 a branch of consonant sunsets mixing 
 dust and herbless ash from mercury 









my phone lets sweet rain
 and birds in the deep current 
 remind me of sorrow

 lines shed by the ground
gravity-scented 
  to wake decay
  
 








i watch the shortest sound 
 of darkness, admire me
 on my long way 
 out of nothing










PAIN 

 
 two hundred minutes 
 curve from the leaves 
 that plan the beautiful 

 that happen to erase
 a dispute, or a moment's future

 that dawn simply in birth's objective:

			 to seed space, inside 
			 you, to evade 
			 retrieved language 
			 











in the strange indifference
 of the week's implacable
 bread, each flower was finished

 it's flesh lets the night lie open 
  as it makes the tangled questions

 		    look at every new leaf
 
 







like imaginary milk
she grows softly 
and tries to live






 can you tell me why you now 
 give me this sign, as style?

 snare a robin, drink sand
 & hook nowhere, to matter?





 the idiocy
 my rhythms create 
 
 out of a bit
     of water smells




a butterfly 
licks littoral
sweat off camera  
cargoes folded before a pig









 in the hope of joy 
 i know the same
 dreaming 
 that fingerprints 
 call 'self-expression' 












  there was a moment 
 in great thick socks
  where she decided

			 i can't 
			 let myself 
			 be hurt 
			 








Plunging her hair into rain.
She says: you need to be loved.







 to echo the ocean's light
 the poison of its elms 
 pruning stars

 that reach to her 
 self the trunk 
 of a mistake









 patient blue images 
 wrapped 
 and showered

 i have a cat too 
 that's new 

 and horses, harmless 
 blue figments

 there is a catch: 
  their skins are not locked
  their infusions warm nothing











 
 i kept a cardinal 
 in my inbox 
 shining

 and 
 a few times, 
 i heard or 
 felt its stench. 












 deified 
 did i consider it 
 home? what with the music 
 every morning, and my mockery 
 poured onto the roof, and the buried 
 cold calls of heavy earth's fear

 singing over remnants 
       of synthesizers
 












 the young story's 
 graying ventricles 
 cool into a lone depth

 as she rolled on to catch him 
 flinging cracked borders from the puddle

 and then won his process of choice 
 blushed home, belonging like joy 











 we were busy 
 in the enormous
 hardwood internet forest

 pebble wristwatches 
 gathered around new 
 story feeds left 
 to rot in the sun 
 of public despair











 when anger rains
 human war

 languages 
 of happiness
 are stomped into dust













someone  

 buried a cat
  at a picnic 

     with a banker 
     designing the dull logo 
          of solitude

			 & other young shapes 
			 half-buried by famine 
			 










 moral tongues 
 decivilize dying

 a garland
 of contentious pills 
 
 the pierced shock 
 of a tree

 a night
 silence











  orchids 
  see soul
  kiss trouble










 and the pain 
 of another's company

 noticed in its benediction
 sends thoughts home 










 never greet the lover 
 on the rocks

 or the children 
 between the houses 

 or the fleas 
 on a forbidden sun

 drowning forever 
 in rooms somewhere









 when sweet must come 
 even from a forgetten 
 secret 
 
 and time comes to hold
 the noise of the dead

 as eunuchs come to sunday tea 
 
 and the many fruits 
        of a secret 
 little moon come 

  to willow rip 
  budded feet 
  on the sun 












i want
 guaranteed demands

 laden and hacked 
 at placenta gate











COWARDICE 

 
	the  clock 
		 soon     uncertain
		 disappears   in us











the rubble wildly-wailing 
 shows you its pedigree, writing 
                swamps onto your flesh










 mama insisted 

 on making a corpse
 from the untold tales 
 of fake vagabonds
 
 to roll in a whisper 
 with a keel of silk 

 	where the earth waits crystal still









body was at ease 
 a wind between 
  skin and mirror








 a hero, 
 undestroyed, 
  died, across from, 
      what was mine.










GREAT LITTLE SOUL. 

 
someone carried you
past the private incorporated
 abandoned sweetness 
                     of walls










 an excited pine-tree 
 watches the sky 
 twist augurs of substance 
 into weary tears







Luria's Illnesses 

	kicked the fists
	where songs stab out







ghetto dreams
kill them all:

 ex-jocks, myal boys, 
 hearth lords, fruit elders

  they are not only tongues









 
 peace writes with 
 dissolving stars 
 (all gold) 
 
 a strange bird,
 old and shattered
 rising from its fetus 
 











 implacable vision 
 walking through the stone summer streets
 treading on fissures of crushed oblivion. 

 stoops in glad naked 
 gloomy invented time










 coulee honey. 
 babylon maple. 
 cherry creek.







high-dive 

 i have 
 no blessing or wit, nor 
 pictures of wordly passions. 
 
 i find my way into everything.
 i wish less lives.









 the bible: its delicate wrecked tongues
 rise into the sky, thick with hours, 
 to dance in a shrine at midnight,
 and leak thunder to make many 
 methods of uniform uniforms
 prison dried under stumped
 unknown birds with lips, 
 the music of the prize 
 to tend the state 









fuck the seed fund 
 of faint encrypted feelings







 
 i remember his point. it was to say:
 
 				when i say 
 				nothing, i 
 				learn. 
 
 







 you remember how her fingers would give 
 a wish to what must be unmoved

 you invent the fatigue of light 
 a shadow awaiting soul

 you leave her more and more within borders 
 rinsing her belly with maps and rules

 you seed a garden strewn with unspoken
 rented contradictions












 i nuzzle sea-sands
 that goddess exactly made
 to seek my hand, and there 
 find burdens  become desert 
 a wing of accumulated doubts







 hands gleaming sweat 
 in her bed in the forest







 that long summer
 we dragged the gully 
 light toward the quiet 
 impossible hopes of sparrow-flocks 
 








 a wide rain of fire filled
     an empire with nipples

 a spice of truth sprouted as a garden 
  in your ear, your watched your words 
                    become wind









what shall we gain?
less yearning? 

fragment ragged warning smoke?
 perhaps our solitude?

 and in spite of ourselves 
  the odd gift? 












 i pushed home 
 the closed
 delicate bodies 
 of babel 
 
 being
 a season
 of valleys
 
 bone's positron 
 twentieth-century 
 heart-felt  dogma












	folded asleep 
	 in the core

	 is a word 
	  never 
	   loved









 
the poet fainted 
beneath the moon 

among dull pink and beautiful knives, 
where the earth had fallen out of the dark

	+

 and there is no fate
 in our thoughts 

 they live 
 in fresh smoke
 clearing the engine's glaze










 the lie 
 will die


   glimpsing an orchid 
       carrying a dawn

 









beauty moving on 
 an electrode hill

	 i listen
	 using time 
	 to play 
	 the earth 









 we enter a hard world: 
 everything again 
 waiting  
 
 we burn a rock 
 in the moist speed
 of being born

 we count many pillow-like weeds
 abandoned on the pavement











EVERYTHING 


 rides up to the borders
 gathers around your bed

+

 i feel its all as clear 
 as if i have forgotten all my life, 
 and naive, all is unread, uncanny, following all











 
 Self-Lost


 perhaps time 
 was speaking about a bird, 
 a creek oiseau creature 
 bonded to wet surface
 
 or a hunter 
 serene, knee-deep in water 
 near the river bottom
 that trembles as it rains










 in that garden, 
 the hiss of wood, 
 in circular darkness 
         is incessant










 
 a human gaze hushed
 at the root, alive 
 in a loop 
 of unbearable messages













 time tells me it's not known at all 
 
 it whirls in exhilaration 
        an absent blessing

 a human complaint behind its breast 












 	only flames
 	heed why happiness
 	stitches earth into play

	          to devour love

 









 even slow attention
 now, too, must obey 
 delusion
 











 for something to know what it was
 and hurl the last massive stars
 out of heaven as wasted light

 nobody must be missing











this family cannot flow, and so
  dies in this chair of dust 









 
 being a taste, you have no 
 concerns nor questions to dance












 i know the fresh edge of an invisible
 winter mesh, a liquid wind exploding









 
 the sky you haven't wanted enough 
 the lake of your own crying fists

 that for the miracle you

 return to morsels
 in sharp brine

 breath shine 
 & shadow ash









in the room that comes before day
 place begins longing










 i am reflection 
 spent in pity

 a river of potatoes

 wise familiar words 
 dreaming a distant star

 forlorn hearts
 letting years sing














 
   this song calibration
 has no need for a wound

      blue lime crumpled 
      in the plum  smoke 
 
         books  becoming 
                 flowers

 











NATURE 

 
 no one can think 
   to learn
 
 a mirror spins 
 straining facts
   to love










NEVER FORGET 

 me 








 In The School Of The Birth-moment 


	 waving 
	 writhing 
	 melting 
	 floating
	 singing
	 flashing
	 breaking










 sorrow knows how to hear 
 what time will not tell
 
 







 of all that we most know 
 the law of each other 
 is needed
 









night's sun kept
whispering to god 
to come taste the bile

 the walls of fog sweeping
 over bright screens, tender 
 soft electronic blessings



 








consolation

 and there are no pearls 
 no holy poet's work to loathe 

 just temptations and torsos 
		    rubbing branches
		      over the wrecks 
		       of homeless faces 




 








SHARK


the price of his glittering house 

 the air that lambs him
 in the torn smocks 
 on the blood flow 

 and the shack 
 bleached glow
 cock blunders

 show the heart speech where
 the ocean will be destroyed. 












ALL 

    the grace  of seized
    certainty-free sleep

    is an oddity 
    best-expressed 
    dead











 summer says: of course 
 all things begin free 
 
 in ambitious recurring
 bright days, where sacrifice 
 revives faith for no purpose










STONE 

 
 the disordered moon in the baby is 
 welcome to become, not art nor dust, nor 
 a wrinkled voice, but driftwood, peacock-shrine 
 cut, through the fresh lungs, a lubricity 
 reads, in sadness motes, a meager vitality









 
 he's she? 
 past engines, 
  otherwise extra. 
 
 i have spoken 
 of all the things 
  fucked. 
 
 so it can leave me 
 when it sings wars. 
  we agree. 













 love the world

				 your voice 
				 this moment 
				 is
				 










 in an impossible way 
 life must be 

 faith in a house 
 somewhere shattered











TONGUE 

 and your silent cinema imitation of green 
 photographs and summer rocks 
 drives the sunset to cut 
 water

 you'll exult less 
 when you feel more














distances 
 made in confused cries 
 pluck a stalk of infinity
 
















 love becomes dust 
 grated used-up
 not good for anything

 











 in three 
 enigma-born 
 dream-poems

 a blackbird sits in my hair


 










gate husks the certainty 
of swimming fitful winds 
 
 vents threaten me from the dead contrary
 night with muses fed on uncensored data














 the selfish 
 wind shield

 its eyes barbecue 
 regulations sleep

 its book severs meaning's 
 immutable grief surfaces

 human things 
 hidden in the eyes 
 of fruit












 i love the swampy pear 
 as always, more saint than calf 
 a home saturday once designed 
 
 by hunger's hornbill 
 an art of tiny hands

 my father hates
 any land you live on












DEATH, A HOUND 

 fused blue and cultured 
 eats cutty-shark manure 
 reins of static liberty

 like flat stars within a sacred leaf 
 emptying swans out of a hollow skin 
 
 the everlasting 
 claw of the teeth

 bone-broke
 brainless 















PRIVATE ROOM 

 in the opposite sense 
 is twice cherished, or 
 scrubbed away
 into electron flecks 
 of backbone 
 complaining walls











OUTSIDE i am scared

 flouds 
 mr. folk 
 pariah ether 

 cities dangling
 by the blanket 
 tangent olives

 forgotten hoahwah
 story mesa 
 breeze clocks

 something has happened to x 
 








 a destiny
 body made 
 
 a crossing 
 escapes 
 the tongue 
 
 my board 
 smells of
 nostalgia 
 








my lips 
cascade
melanomas

almond orange
cry clear
looks









 north over fountain's snow-covered winds
 ears strike a supervised precedent

 to disperse the sea's 
 warm seal of hard 
 enslaved cameras










 you hear the house see

 imagining a queue of leftover
 animals linked in sexual 
 chronology










in the arms of this muted 
 loneliness 

 nothing moves 
 micromanaging 
 
 the sudden perseid bones
 of resistance wounds

 and ruelle water
 battered by forty years 
 of artistry










 
 
 sunday, six-hour star, honey, the lone sun.

 death becomes an alchemical favorite
 a big funeral sentimental 

 web buzz raft









Dub nerve chorus 

 the logs are asleep
 and ore a winding intent 
 deep within a chain of houses 
 perceived swallowing light
 snakes in the distant air




















 saw what i say i know

 you land
  inside me 
 like sky 
 
 i forget my eyes 
  to kiss 
 your hands

























 
 
 
 i wept here
 across the milk gates of the factory 
 while my father began to erase 
 money with a mouth-sternum-navel-cleft
















 i have suffered the 
 intimate nerve thoughts 
 of rock dry 
 conspiracies swirling
  wonder














THIN HEART 

 
 here, awake, hold me 
 at your bosom, let no scorned 
 grass politics clanking muffled 
 pierce the salt meadow

 blurred feeling
 wound enough 
 to guess














SPEECH


 enormous hollows flung bright 
 from the pewter array
 pilgrim moment 

	 fear 
	 to sing
	  enthusiasm 
 
 as when i left a pair of dead 
      kids rigid burning

    prayer owner's upheaval 
        after hate 
      made the point in me 
 











 3:49 dawn, always 
 here, i regret
 the wind in her blue coats 
 
 salmon-pink alloy 
 cucucurrucued evaporating










 a fading brightness of horses burns the way 
 sometimes a sun somewhere in america was 
 
 measured in a riderless decline, a 
 sparrow-flock of angels in a plague of suns










militant 
 tongue asking 

 shadow to jump 
 through defeat

 bridges 
 shooting fanged agony
 from honey machines

 pine-dark dogs 
 tar canku rows

 hitching friezes 
 where ancients sleep













I see

 night cause this saying

 what follows spying on
 the effect of the rest

 planted on mountain's peak 
 love demands all-love-forever












time-girdled, imploding
    they wake for love 












don't take him back. right away. 
 flames, like stories, die.













 let love ripen again, 
 let your bones pass over this universe.














 we did not know 
 the glow of things
 the shine that made
 day swallow our paths










dead water
etched into 
 unicorns

  oil-coil & pork-sky dreams
 double-hard, darkening-wild
              snowblue hands











 only nothing 
 the feeling to be
 such separation















		 we are born
		 stalking 
		 last-gasp 
		 lust










 raw pods of rainbow hair




 
 old meals 

 my soul already wanting to lift 
 nowhere,          bent barefoot 
 by the fence          with rain. 
 











every wave 
 is a model
 logic farms














 mankind sustains abominations 
	 money-hungry and happy








 orchids to pencils
 one antiquated dot 
 
 rare charity 
 in violet harm 
 bridges  crime
 
 one hour of such надо, raised a way 
 of casual birds, a beard addressing napalm







					 we have forgotten
					 we were raised 
					 to pause













 i love how you watch the glass 
 that separates me from
                the photograph












 sin. 
 
 i, the falcon, 
 planted the southwest
 scratched soil 
 flew trembling thru fog











mind is a smudge


oxygen wax 
 
 veins 
 in the bleachers 
 of the visual propeller

 peasantry car meat

 misery piers 
 ninja planets








 
 
 i sit at home 
 a sky in a photo
 
 a sliver of flesh
 burned with light 

 brandishing 
 nothing
 
 an adamant singing
 declaring  the sun 
 











 my story is 
 like a voice
 which sings 
 when it cannot











 sit, cry no longer, find 
                      a calling

		robot offers 
		ignite answers

		we are mattered 
		   fate rhythms









Sipping on Estrangement 

 
 he sighs over early-closed flaws
  contextless phone calls missed
  flights that stopped the fruit of together 
 








 sicken 
 silent 
 sad

 even though 
 the world 
 is planned 
 similitude 
 
 paper-thin 
 self-effacing
 lost dreams
 come to smother
 happiness









 beautiful men thresh flora diamondine 
 impolite free sandstone parcels
 
 where the headland pliant 
 satisfaction bore deep scars






 
 i'm not saying we're right 

 stone lifts naked
 magazine oil egos

 a punished bird 
 unbeheld morphs 
 into silk blood









 love struggling
 along the field

 redeeming gestures
 of ochre sea-spray

 winter's precise 
 guarded  amazement







in the womb 
 of manhattan 
 scattered on gloss 
 between pine and snowy wires

 anguished yum 
 on fluted agave's 
 discarded pavement 
 











 big and clear 
 wrapped in ignorance 
  
 i count things 
 i am  dreaming










 the future slid preying on us 
 in the peak of the dawn light








 archived orphan tumours
 cut home in whore steps







 a never-ending winter
 opened the long odors
 of an impending  song








	 language 
	 throttled
	 trees










death-spasm
twist of stars
ate dog time 
 
 wept
 a button
 spurting









 mouth ranged into the street
 whirling translucent in the hope 
 of some other







  people told dead 
 heaped empty webs 
       sloth yarns











 our hearts returned to 
  weather the fallen 
  debate of the floor

 recalcitrant 
  rings screwed in 
  narrow undulations

 burning cliffs 
  silently pitted 
  with gas bridges










 hiss light 
 and cure kin 

 whistle at the guard of blood 
 
				          when 
				 chance laughs
				   death feels










 

 i toss love down
 i get up

 even the sound of god 
 ignores me

 i build a table from the horizon










by your slurried window, 
 the only place you never are

 rabbits listen, and  
 a great stone spasms 

  birthing a shy 
 inner metaphysical  
 springtime









 
 dawn 
 commandos oil
 the formalist you 
 
 ah, the sum of homes 
 
 a cloak of paper bowing among mangroves 
 a desiccated summer glowing in the wind

 asleep with swans










like the doctor
 whom the words ash 
 in cargo

 i lean 
 to thrill
 disguised

 meditation 
     bridge 
     crumbs 
 










 a mole attitude
 blooms in the real poem

 a statuette of rain
 a pet kept by a crowd










 
 
 i have not always been   
   what i was, so i am happy
   when they come, and we is sick. 
 
 we have you, they think 
    to wake without, and 
    soap the mountain.
 
 i want to talk to you with you
   until you forgive me.

 w/out u, i'd have 
   no birth at all 
      no childhood.













 the enigma 
 of this leaf bloom
 cures the backyard

 what's to come after the house
 expiration? you do not want details
 about it: that last need of being

 you hide yr pain in pride's moment 
 taste a future known only in symbols











 a seer furled 
 becomes hush endless

 offal, a friend
 caught in a vinyl mirror

 a rage of telegrams; a legless 
 animal burning; an invisible 
 floating rock










she wants an inflammable 
 scrap horse in bed

he knows any good aggragates
 will be sent ill-luck

she notices courage's small legs swell
 as she touches him, he blinks shuts











why tell them 
 everyone is ravaging nothing

 foreshadowing neglected
 synonyms weaving 

 a pulse of lakes 
 i need to watch you -- 
 














the worst 
 is love 

 that deflection daoist 
 poet held like the pen

 void, unwanted 
  human nature

  united with the floor
  you are taken and cry













 summit of contractions 
  those odd antique stones groping 
     a row of afterthoughts 

     	 +
		 
		 i fetch a false arrow 
		 and sow  power

		 to save one mocked
		 bulging
		 strangeness











 adversaries thread 

				      a trance for 
				 imprisoned
				   fledgling trees
				  
	soil swaying 
	 like molten bones

	     bread hardened 
	           into words

		        walking dusk 
		           into desolation














 every day a woman 
 passes through a dark alley 
 of industrial beech light 
 
 touching the apple-red agaric wings 
 washing a glossy hare in horikoshi mustard 
 
	 sipping resveratrol
	 to awaken the heart











 nature

 tells someone 
 about anywhere
 
  nothing fails













		    bless me empty
		          softened
		             heavy

    in a throbbing chair
          of blood hunger

 something burns the grace 
  of eternal loss, becomes
       a polyphonic canker














Being answers


 a cage with no retreat 
 a bowl of sturdy moments

	    & wonder
	    goes on 

			    before they 
			    declare you

			    	   over












 i will open 
 a holiday 

 at a little distance
 from unlistening

 and touch
 only the almost 
 beautiful enough

 at the edge of the poem
 offer weeds as gifts













    acumen
 describes
 the night

 rescues moist
  bravery, and shakes
    
    as thirty pills shoot 
    a wire into awareness 

 
 







in the covenant of women 
 a path quickens

		   all afternoon 
		        it rains 
		 
      each place falters 
   catching the light

 dying to display desire 
         or lack thereof 










 beauty

 physiological 
       in time
    not heaven

 wakes a handful of confessions

 stands, letting midnight
 play within it, grinning










 a flutter 
 of rendition
 speaks of god 
 
 as if he or she were alive
 in water striking literature 

 no duplicate 
 tasks to improvise 
 
 not even death,   marked 
				   to talk 
				   to this spot 
 
 nothing makes it the word 
 of my seizures  against 
 the stillness of hope 
 
               past 
             space 
          implies 
     endorphines












 one lover's back
 pulls holes from
 the field's sand 

 damp with empty blood




	 life juice
	 locked within light
	        shakes stars
	 
	  unflattering hills 
	   flail into prayer 




 a trough
 of lovers call
 feelings a mistake 
 
 their glittering 
 squinted jurisdiction
       sublimates care 
 













 two blossoms 
 turn bed
 into garden 

 book 
 a pulsing sky
 within water


 undulant
 accursed
 moments

 full thrill 












we talk 
 what others
     think










 a kiss is
 a cardio problem

 stitched 
 felt 
 satellite lines

 indignity
 whiffs of emotion

 a mud echo 
 shut into the hours 
 beneath slang










Inside
silence

 beyond 
 what i am thinking

 i am alone
 and will never be born


			  time eats 
			  the words 
			   of worms













come, speak me

life will still 
be just this 
 








 
 as stars spent
 words they could not 
 feel

 their green hands
 cut odor

 all i have done
 at last, becomes
 a stem











the shape of doors

 remind me of wheat 
 beneath the plumage 
 circling echo

 a narrow nadir 
 open and tuned

             a gun 
           inside the shed
          smearing shadows











 hoax children
 no longer turn
 stones into air 
 









 i sit on salt 
 my mother said

 phlegm, so necessary 
 only a wretched scent of sleep
 belongs to higher things










she runs home
to the soft-conched bush

to explain how the child 
 didn't like me, and how it

 means nothing because
 i am listening to you 











to eat is to be known, to get 
     glittering self nectar 
    from flesh meditation 
 
   to remember what
 you must see, perhaps 












 

 
 beautiful anemones
 
	   sounded 
	   wounded 
	  confused

	   sweat 

	  on sunlit ground
	  in full-unfolded

	       riff stroke madness












	 for       me 
	 here forever

	 loud    silk 
	 sweet spikes 
	 mist pattern

	 harp reservoirs
	 
	 dirty    harm

 could we have said, 
 again, what 
 is precious

 what the sagacious 
 howled small cynical
 great narratives 
 had convinced
 the mother 
 blubbered mind 
 to like

 and to borrow my ear 
 so we might 
 shut in them 
 the beautiful
 feeling pieces










 it starts in the morning 
  out of the heavy-winged 

 veins of
   reason:
 
 
 the first 
    singing 


     +


	 behind me 
	 a thing is
	    kneeling

	 unable to keep 
	      any secret 
	 within its reach 












 
 
 in one bones 
        again 
 there is rock

	 & a tree 
	 eating
	 a potato

	 a chair
	 covered 
	 in honey

	 a sparrow
	 on a bus
	 smiling












 in the morning two days later 
 blue sounds strike the valley
 
 and with judgments crack
 what has always been invisible
 









 when a dream shifts 
 its position 
 
 it shreds the whine 
 of inherited stones









 she lies on her back in the field 
 and feels the screams from the city
 eat into her beautiful ears








germinations
 turn death 
 into sex







microbial sympathy routine








 like the heart of a lake 
 we are wounded with time

 bound by blood's secret
 dust of favorite things 
 
 bright
 quarrelling
 valley











THERE IS NOTHING IN ME. 

 except pandas
 stirring empty 
 unknown shadows

 lovely ink of blatant
 transparent fleshless 
 copious corpse clouds 

 motor virgins of lichen 
 whispering that the body 
 destroys what she planned 
			 
		amputated wings 
		in an abandoned cradle











 a hope i thought i achieved
 toiling in the alley  
 
		 like a trip 
		 without baggage











 to thank the mess, she said, is not right

 maybe its a favor to drown
 what life shows in books 
 
 i hate to find this page in my body

 printing me till i live to explain
 how-to become old, die without fret 










Spring frowns and falls 
 towards the world 

 crowded with yarn
 irrigation light

 a robocounter
 in the fields 

 a beach 
 sparkling 
 
 arms and breasts
 appearing from folds

 dirty clouds
 budding taut  
 drench the sea 










 mercy passed on the next book 
 of those not speaking love -- 
 
 we know that they stayed small, optically- 
 positioned to pull in the breath of people










freedom is what nobody is:
 a core absent mystery 

a gleam sewing faces into inaction
  as if there is not enough to do 

plastic tape-roll peeling rocks 
 to reveal little meatlockers 









this strange 
summons visits
    every brain
 









in that ancient room-- 
 there was something 
 the opposite of home

 an answer snail, 
 a pentagon econolodge 
 a mad silly translation of time
 a chimney before dawn, a trickle of cold
   loam pointing with your whole hand
   			  toward fermented windows
















ballad's concussion 
 concludes in drool

that's the way it is 
 it licks anyone who looks 













 
 do you even see me? 
 when i am not in bed? 
 
 and do you see your mother's 
 fingerprints in my mouth?

 and the petals on your neck 
 trembling with rules?
 
 and the sparrows 
 in the swamp 
 carving hopes?

 or the sun 
 playing ancient cellos?












Some of that rain
 stabs reveries 









 
 a foot-path for what is crushed 
 a pure horror gulag fountain 
 
 every grandmother runs through it 
 












NOTHING 


 we saw eyes dream

 in home-sick skin jails 
	    
	    wrappers, 
	     greater than any 
	   distance, thought 
	      around the body 















Woman God


 let's be clear
 each day is a lever


	     the naked church
	      refuses to take grief 
	         into the machine 
 












 
weeding self-pity
 

 black cars moved 
 over a sagging cloud 












Last Tone From The Ancient Fabric Of A Child


 curling on her lap, the hush 
 of oak trees, a silver trout 
 with winged horns, and a soft    rain 

           thoreau shows how narrative
              floating awake like that
 cryed for years in the blue sin











Where We Stand

 today we gave our money
 to feed one life

 our emotions weighed
 our replacement 

	 we held the deep 
	 paths of the wind 
	  
	    to make sure  
	    united chaos 

	 wasn't a transitory 
	 lotus breakthrough










 pills by sour peaks. 
 my neck calligraphy.
 
 unwilling bread sculptures.
 rooting mountain poster rock.











 the end is filled

 its ample hands 
 hovering over bright snow

 its white horns rolled 
 in cellophane startled 

 touch sheets of sludge
 from the dryhtlic dance-off










 joke rage
 
 
 before that 
 at the point 
 at which i'm still 

                     here 

    people's skin
    devious amid melting fists 
         ate buckets of births










 restless stuff
 absolves disorder

 what is it i mean by this? 

         i harvest foliage 
         that burns my heart

			 i am
			 a sinking boat 
			 on a locked tide
			 









 
 
 we won't trick minds
 
 or ascend
 with touch 
 to join the stars 
 when you die

 	





		   complicated fumes 
		   root in numb fire














chant 
love
each day

sing a spectacular music 
outstretched in the grasses

forget your animal body consumed 
by light expanding fogiveness









music on the floor, 
 poised asleep on the edge outside of things 
 in some place  where molten

 mosquito rock 
 intelligent shows
 possibility pity










 my heart eats ashes 
  others love me 
 
 i like it at home
 i have these analogies

 i feel lulled in with sides
 a еспредельщик contigous grin 
 
 a solace that stares as it grows











angel 
 of structure, i fall like a tear 
 into torture ditch code: 
 c,d,d,b,b,a,b,a,a,c,b,b,b,c,b,d,b,d,c
 
 i see the hunter pushed, head up 
 into the bathroom, preening. 

 i hear you shut the takeout box
 that bears my name
 heaped before the tv













 whitman's fake appetites
 make the x listen back









in the golden hotel 
 eating cake 
 despair gates
 
 clockwork cusp of sycamores 
 lined up, yawning, seduced,
 lost in wonders' fibrous machinery

 endless anomalies
 dusting the dross 










 1000 amber deaths, & a little wind 
 set out to remember lyric stone 
 debtors' trysts, power salience











bitter future anaphor
 
 a forgotten echo
 bare and for sale

 a vast sweaty
 stolen wild residue

 fading bereft
 limp salt rim

 ruins 
 sufficiently used
 becoming archives













during this dance 
  sky cracks 

  and lust
  (a rubber ducky)
  watches 
 
			 tyrant-haters 
			 gang-fight 
			 










 
 i. 
 
 the countless salt 
 in everything


 ii.

 a word, a tiny word, 
 round as mercy


 iii.

 a lifetime lit 
 by speckled rags 













 after the perfection of the feast 
 we were not supposed to note loss 
 
 or brick-strewn trickle grapes 
 sagging where payrolls whisper







 i remember the sounds of heaven within the whale 
 








 and so the waif 
 (sheathed chasing 
 crowded water) 
 watched the village breach

 clamouring with time 
 at the entrance to a velocity 
 where expectation slipped

 
 
 





infinity sometimes
is a danger 
tearing despair 
from the pattern-book of dream






the true road was commotion 
 an overgrown aim 

 behold my mind by the sea. your 
 side under my mouth, succumbs. do 
 i create you? ready root glare 
 of my body, an email flood 
 that tries to let light in






 thread distances
 before they pass 








 open the chaos

 a flying tongue
 squeezing language

 				

 let relations 
 come home 
 to illumination 









evanescenct war

 an unreal fever  










long ago now 
 a secret mood 
 hid behind

 as it rained












 p. placing her hands 
  on the lyric and tubes

  jagged letter savanna 














FRANTIC 

 stirred and fragrant as any dream 
  reaching she reverts me

 we spoke for a moment
  left 
   in love 
 
 for this is the year
  we pass the heart sirens 
  bleeding pause 
 
 the pale impossible noticed 
  bronze-gold spaces

 the ribs that fill this bed 
  with song-book hammer valleys 
      beating dirt into smiles 













the paralyzed priest 
remains undiscouraged 
 
 Idomeneus singing until
 the flower of heart's 
 caress scatters 
 

         beauty holds 
          a cold bell











 river tore 
 around the bricks

 ushered and scrubbed 
 past the meditation 

 up to tree 
 on a fjord 
 to warn you 













having seen fear
invoke drama

 i watched in distress 
 my teenage txt recede
 into gutted emptiness
		 
		 ancient words
		 waiting in the sea 














 reboot all installer code
 awake as a lifeless alert

 










 you're the first thing i saw:
 the scent of grief, fresh-washed

 useless grime enclosing
 a weakness amphitheatre

 honey-suckle's embryo trench












 morbid grass on dead 
 clouds moldy sloshes 

 the decaying nameless wise shadows 
 and the reflections of the welcome 

 a clique of suspended penetration

I Wish To Be Closed In The Intimacies Of Love
	 

	 a pool open 
	 to the bottom of history 

	 children floating
	 on fluted rain 
	 
     the deep cream of an unerring land













until 
 time-lapse pollen and water-clock care 
 swarm regret visionaries in a chorus
 of flesh-traded brand-new raving

mouth 
 will release  a shadow 
 of sewers among swamps 













 because they were screwing 
 on our hairy chairs 

 and splintered particles
 were escaping through 
 a fine hole facing a fire
 
 rages, disenfranchised, 
        conjoined cliffs 
 











 get upon her 

 spread and drunk 
 crammed in

 clinging to a weight of coffins











 where ashes 
 never-living

 softly beat
 a disturbed task 
 












		with a frown 
		full of honey 

		 i surrender
		 to a past 
		            
		    where passions 
                imagine me 
















 john cool gasps,
 grasps twilight black

 blue ashtray glass, picks
 green flowers shooting

 hidden among 
 green stalks. wakes 

 everyone who won't enter

 celadon paths that run 
 to see coyote flaws spring












 
 solitary huckleberry 
 in the bright bottom of the void










 
 Fleece-hustle Taste

 I summon ash, pine-forests 
 and bubble-awe high-risk flocks











a flame rare, endures, nothing 
but a cataract of foam-flecked talk
that cries out, upright and massive
for the troubled stink of sleep











the house they dragged 
 out of the daylight 
 talked 

 









 clay
 argues with the moaning
                     sun

 tattered     books
  
 who seem to write the fool 
 and kiss     the nest home

 i cannot dream you  
 beauty   diseaseed
   smooth in my bed













 orchestra isolation 
 without ambition's mushroom
 cut bones into the color of isms










  
 poetry flows in joy 
  above what moans 

 all climb her 
  light 

 to drink warm 
  wine 

 and gaze at 
  bearded spines

 huddling in the brain 
  leaking wet cochineal spice














waves
 a broken ledge 
 a pool of bright fronds 
 a jail bulletin
 a metronome 
 a death-note 
 












 in this model
 the ground
 doesn't matter

 and life floats 
 toward loss
 leaving lullabies 














folded breath

 approaching a wall
  of mild appropriated 
   saturation

 peak
 transparency

 where words
 scratch self 
 with speech milk













 so often dust like the feet
 of an illegal tree 
 comes to spill the muses












 
 this afternoon 
 all the sunlit 
 songs of water run 
 toward cool mute twilight



 
 








 
 devil's muscle draws
 empty cream, brick 
 jockstrap roar 
 and hungry skulls 
 quiet and young

 that's the wisdom 
 of this dead thistle

	 cinnabar fields












 angry are their paths thru the games 


 sounds are dry here, their souls

 death is the shadow truth 
 of meat, apollo's peace

 they are alone, lost in steps

CHANGE TOO LATE

 
 on the last crucial rail of light, 
 the void does not see the vaulting
 turning air, nor cities folded 
 as they lie at home, dwelling in
  venus' orbits














 adorned duress 
 inside gown albatross

 arranged red tents 
 and stonecrop unities

 reverence the way 
 they're mutilated 












 they listen on these nights  
 to an elegant shift

 forgetting the tracks 
 inside the interface

 they want to be 
 platform sediment

 his team impossible 
  lowland  enclave 
 of pompous clothes

 his mint weather-hen 
  swirl of dappled bowl 
 executive-proved awakenings









 together at a picnic 
 of pastel-drawl deeds
 and sensitive velvet-ice









 
 show me, once you've fallen too far, too long 
 in blue, through my dream where mother hidden 
 and free shines, while dad hearing me, writes not 












 a mind in pain i am 
 tearing at cherished words

 the body's fresh rewards 
 scarcely felt as growing 














 Kerygma 

 in the latitude of the way, they choose 
 to sleep, letting the law of things
 pack white wet privilege 
 
 we enter with those folk, 
 bound in the name of you. 

 to sing: i am digestive soul 
 perched numb on an old wise song
 for i ask nothing out of love 













 
 every spring must
 kiss the stream 
 bent with snow 

 prisoners without feeling
 rinsing the valley in a knot
 of enflamed breath
 
 










 
 i am smoking a persistent nazar: 
 a field encompassing maps, colony- 
 lines, slave-reading light as it grazes 
 its primary-braid of north snow-gestures










 Calm always deep Hyperion
 is an island stuck 
 in sherbet like a shell 
 inhaling regret tallow 










 sick driving
 a plastic code
 and the perfume 
 of crackhead matrix 
 cornbeef jumps stinking 
 over her high birthday skin
 hernia leashed to altar-stains 
 











 a muse calls to its peers: 

	 an om orb, at home in the market, 
	 a resilient heart thicket,
	 a thin statue, bare-legged,
	 a guest, thrown out, pacing 
	 chronos who sells ringing

	 nothing filled when alone 
	  believing knows












 
 
 i hear obedience weeping
 swallowing gravel

 as the cold old one waking 
 says: what is broken is bad















 Perhaps They Crawl


 to lecture the carnival flower 
 to rust the chilled reptilian cicadas 
 to leap-frog monuments 
 to chide dewy plates floating like flax

 in these a kind of gratified order has happened













Who Came To Shit Visions and Desire?


 Poetry with a beautiful mouth 
 cheating the sunset out of pain













Hard Flower 

 
  a tree's child
  calls a rock 
  to the agitation 
  of vegetable touch















 now i am chalk.

 and i regret to be
 the yesreaderyes -- that 
 heart anecdote taken from me

 i'm old and rare and torn
 
 and i am sure voice now realizes 
            sound is an acid jail.


















 We Number It 
 
 
 iii 
 
 and point the mountain's lines 
 and swarms of autumn
 toward my dad's hut

 where he said i thought 
 it was what you wanted. 
 
 i cannot taste you, 
 the way the cherry relaxing 
 tastes voices or analogies 
 as pieces of african rock, 
 sea-gull, doorbells, or grape.
















 in between, friendship
 was a difficult love story

 slow endeavours 
 to access her belly 
 to dry her eyes

 i am not talking, nor am i waiting 
 to see perhaps if it fits 
 explicitly in this impeccable














 racing with breath 
 in perpetual pain

 guarded like emptiness

	 remember 
	 that god 
	 is looting

	 quiver
	 sufficiently perished -- 

	 inherit yourself 
	 
	 there is no zero here 
	 




	







 
 time engulfed us 
 to nibble this willow 
 
 bed 
 deep
 swells

		 the significance 
		 of a misplaced heart
		 in a fierce tent of ribs
















I Am Writing To 

 the bullets & the windows

 water is too confident 
 nothing is empty 
 
 i've no room for that














 spider 
 listens

 opening 
 love 

 as it instructs 
 soft dismal knowledge

 to imagine
 living exiled 

 among stories
 of a sea-worm soul














dawn fields

 kicked upward laughing 
 at their own flood

 constricting the smell of snow
 to where shining first went


















Mind By This Clay Breathes
 

 unconstructed and ensouling, clear. 
 windy and numb, reversing. 

 later a landscape is spined out of it, 
 a victimized bump, and desire below, speaks.



















The Last Bliss 


 those bright lines 
 in our spine
 are silence

 i am kept
 in a movie 
 in a coffin 
 in the gutter
 in slender sounds
 suspended over a lake












 my third instinct
 through a graceless
 angel cyclone cuts holes 
 into angry infinite blues













 shadows sang 
 to the holy woman

 her wounded hair
 seized the gate

















I Close My Face On The Stems


 a photo of candles 
 on the path
 where i am born 
 
 air shining 
 by the box of answers 
 in a summer room 
 
 i am eating 
 the sound 
 of a heart
 to calm the moon
















 

 the song's air
 supposed the wrong thing 
 
 sliced the tender
 last book
 
 shaped a picture
 with rules
 
 made time
 wiretap space

 removed
 our content 















 the scent of things in things 
 holds a serious bitter radiance

 body's mind, light-footed as nothingness,
 promised an entire cloying rumored lice-oil
                    love    reconfiguration

















 for what is not is what is 
 in the hole day forever whole
 
 head must break off hand 
 to choose an hour 

 draw on a puddle 
 of faded butter 
 a rumor of the sun














i will write three short dreams today. 
 
	 
	 in the first: i touch a prurient 
	 cheese, then purchase a nose. 

	 second: rivers run inside walls
	 looking, unsuccessfully, for windows

	 third: a blossoming lignum-vitae
	 offers a sauce of pleasure
	 to dead ruined letters 











melody believes in meat 
 
 darkness hard 
 revolution fossils 








how does one paint grief 
 on the elegance of the infant








Light Was Wasted On Us


 the night is full of comments 
 
 all-new roaches 
 fluffing death

 my heart is thinking how 
 i miss your presence











 balance laughs 
 a secret joined 
      to progress











 convergences leak 
 a precocious blood-lust

 as naturally as one might
 hold a howitzer 

 i was saying 
 this always 
 in bed 











 
 There Is No Therapy Now


 liberty, dying, receives a future
 melody written to forget

 wrought in the garden heart
 haunted by the climbing

 boastful 
 celebrities, choking 
 inside discards bags 











 forests and darkness
 require guns

 beloved curieux 
 madness 
 under the oaks

 toys disappearing 
 in a roar of primeval
 being

 while in many minds 
 some interior kind prometheus 
 constellation scuffed
 construction star
 burns in the shadows 
 
 and at the edges of it 
 is what i am not sure 
 











it once seemed 
that wisdom came out of each word
and phenomena sang a rainbow 

 how is it that the poetry of miracles 
 understands substance as a barren 
 shuffling of books and roots?











 phony corrupt
 gushing counselors 
 breed juxtaposed 
 on the table

 river 
 light 
 faces 
       the ocean

 we wake 
 to go again










 i am happy as i chant 
 past suicides 

 gesturing at glands
 broken in me



	  like me 
	 the grass 
	 brings in 
	 a body 
	 sometimes 

	 awakened 
	 to hear
	 the hidden
	  free i 











hungry songs 
in your etymologist 
 crown leap out 
 remarried 
 same-sex 











  talkers ween with fear
  the south lawn studs 

 patiently vague
 worksong raw 

 swimmers who
 deceptive glitter 
 among thrush waves

			 plankton
			 solace 












 there's a vein 
 in this song, a zeal 
  useless
 chrysalis of silence












 
 limbs. 
 i remember, 
 one.










 under the feast pulse
 in the mouth of nothing

 above humpback rhythms where
 people sign crosses, my father

 plays with a beautiful
 quiet bivalve of doubt

 a wind full of foxes and pebbles 
 flashing cuticles of saint thigh 
 








yet you
 found what you sailed for 
 to hide the clearing, no need 
 of doubt, no need to end 
 in your centre stone pain









And Die 

 to have a choice, to live 
 cling to paved wanderlust

 play the tender sheaves 
 of their graves

 a packet of warm blood 
 and blind abdomen lice 
 crying up from the sea











Our Witty General Woes



	  diamond unperplexed 
	 she spends her language 
	  expiating rotating cages 












 the light smells
 bent-winged 
      of crimson
        dreaming












 at the end 
 drawing dust 
 on the face 
 of fantasy









Your Metal Be Done 
 

 grief (like bees)
 redeems an archipelago
 inside a mirage






 
 tyrant flux







 the room stands

 	physically 

      	when i fall






 a bird in the asylum
 its mouth leaks home







 you are born enough 
 no doubt you can be      beautiful

 








 my body is sutured labyrinths
 a love nourishing mind thirst







NEW 

children emerge from the wreck 

				 flaw ordained 
				 pinioned dead 
				 rumour poised











Grief Circles Forgotten Trees


 what i can't remember 
 of this place 
  sings itself

 outside there is 
  a dog, a beach,
  stones, a console, 
  a highway, planes.












 and we are hungry, we say 
 for the ideogram devotion 
 
 we discuss, it is assumed,
 the cold balcony shit god









 a little moment
 migrated into fingers 

 & ha! 

 flow by ashen
 contemplation 
 
 oak united naked 
 damp water smoke

 to love the seizure 
 wit broken entrance

 i remember the word 
 laid hot to sweeten











 so people went to the prison 
 the racist ruined black wind

 the fresh emblem of the wandering echos 
 a gap gurgle stew of twine turbid doors 











Hate The Same 


 i almost wanted to do this 
 to hear you talking

 but no, i live my name
 enumerating 
 its couplets, ignore 
 my tongue 

 until i am a glock swat 
 invitation 
 halting wounds












Toothless Sextalk


 husk drawn to the sludge
 lips, rewarded with rain 
 
 overcome by dust
   engines unfold










 a starved whim gently stands
 wrapped in possibilities







 for troilus, the year  
 during which i'm dead 
 was dangerous










i hold a zen love
 spun

out of perfect insects
 shuddering in the wind 
 
 i draw my cedar back to wine: 
  ripening  satisfied













You Woke

 
 summer dawns 
 inside bread 
 & wild grass

 long skies 
 drunken butterflies 
 cream whispers 

 sound makes us 
 dwell and fall

 







tender sticky and open

	you stand 
	  at the rose door
	and crawl inside

	 As morning springs so quickly from the ground, 
	 Light's song flowers in the meadow's long hair.

	 We no more hear the stars once so long there, 
	 And the faintest reeds of summer's wide wave.

	 A soft warm air heavy with the sun's breath 
	 Touches the eastern hills with slow showers 
	 Wet woods rush to cover the crumbling hills.

 The Argument of the Dead Man 
 
 
 I was in the middle of the river

 And the deep night of the morning

  in that summer house, hours 
                   lying down, thinking

  how the blood, succumbing 
  without loss, works to heal
      imaginable and solitary tautness

 May the wet moons of your quick dark heart 
    graze, counseling travellers, leaving

 watching it all, being warm.

        By the anxieties of wounds
             in desired structures 
              hold the sharp hairs 
 of sickness floating in the blood 
					 

					 Summer asleep 
					 Lifts flowers 
					 Curled sheers

And although Equality does seem rugged, --

Cycle


Summer night 
    on the land.

Then sun 
   in the first breath 
      of early morning 
	
Stars lying down 
   on frosted grass

A soft fire
   in the sky
	 
A wind 
   reading 
         trees

And then night again.

	To Be

	 We have no time at the end for 
	      the shore where it kneels

 At the end of the forest (a place

All That I Know Of All That Is Left


	   I know your blue throat, 
		  writing as you sleep. 
			 
		 Smoke-wreaths howling 
			  over the hot sea 
			   to see my voice 
		fall so near your feet. 

		 To see the wild light
		        as rain breaks
		        into thin snow 
		            as i pause
		         on the stairs 
		     above the kitchen. 

		 These are minutes to worry 
		     about. The rain caught 
		rushing at windows, begging 
	  to hear the garden in the sun.

Sharpest Vegetarian

  
 He caught the plastic bird and stood by the wall.

 Now when the bird would try to burn him with a blow, 
    to make him bleed and be vengeful, a wild mortal 
           child, hunted by the place, tickled water.

Are you Ready To Eat Chain? 

 Grimaces. Half-trained voices: dark ground. 

 Even erosions pausing. Calfing.
 Adorations full of prehensions.

 Moralists embracing in remote hospices:
  switchboards peddling inexplicably inauspicious 
  limits honed from unreasonable ambitions, 
  newly-hatched schemes struck down as they are overtaken.

 Friendship 


      I choose years where less 
    Is sown. Let innocence roam
    To love a cruel clever foam.

 All words are orphans! I guess
  The times you hurt descend to 
       Make you hold me in blue.

	Poem Of The Sacred

 sense flowers in the breast of my mind

 Let us have madness openly.
O men Of my generation.
Let us follow
The footsteps of this slaughtered age:
See it trail across Time's dim land
Into the closed house of eternity
With the noise that dying has,
With the face that dead things wear--
nor ever say
We wanted more; we looked to find
An open door, an utter deed of love,
Transforming day's evil darkness;
but We found extended hell and fog Upon the earth,
and within the head
A rotting bog of lean huge graves. 




As We Are So Wonderfully Done With Each Other - Poem by Kenneth Patchen
Autoplay next video

As we are so wonderfully done with each other
We can walk into our separate sleep
On floors of music where the milkwhite cloak of childhood lies

O my lady, my fairest dear, my sweetest, loveliest one
Your lips have splashed my dull house with the speech of flowers
My hands are hallowed where they touched over your
soft curving.

It is good to be weary from that brilliant work
It is being God to feel your breathing under me

A waterglass on the bureau fills with morning . . .
Don’t let anyone in to wake us. 



Be music, night,
That her sleep may go
Where angels have their pale tall choirs

Be a hand, sea,
That her dreams may watch
Thy guidesman touching the green flesh of the world

Be a voice, sky,
That her beauties may be counted
And the stars will tilt their quiet faces
Into the mirror of her loveliness

Be a road, earth,
That her walking may take thee
Where the towns of heaven lift their breathing spires

O be a world and a throne, God,
That her living may find its weather
And the souls of ancient bells in a child's book
Shall lead her into Thy wondrous house 



Wherever the dead are there they are and
Nothing more. But you and I can expect
To see angels in the meadowgrass that look
Like cows -
And wherever we are in paradise
in furnished room without bath and
six flights up
Is all God! We read
To one another, loving the sound of the s’s
Slipping up on the f’s and much is good
Enough to raise the hair on our heads, like Rilke and Wilfred Owen

Any person who loves another person,
Wherever in the world, is with us in this room -
Even though there are battlefields. 



The old guy put down his beer.
Son, he said,
(and a girl came over to the table where we were:
asked us by Jack Christ to buy her a drink.)
Son, I am going to tell you something
The like of which nobody was ever told.
(and the girl said, I've got nothing on tonight;
how about you and me going to your place?)
I am going to tell you the story of my mother's
Meeting with God.
(and I whispered to the girl: I don't have a room,
but maybe...)
She walked up to where the top of the world is
And He came right up to her and said
So at last you've come home.
(but maybe what?
I thought I'd like to stay here and talk to you.)
My mother started to cry and God
Put His arms around her.
(about what?
Oh, just talk...we'll find something.)
She said it was like a fog coming over her face
And light was everywhere and a soft voice saying
You can stop crying now.
(what can we talk about that will take all night?
and I said that I didn't know.)


You can stop crying now. 



Man-dirt and stomachs that the sea unloads; rockets
of quick lice crawling inland, planting their damn flags,
putting their malethings in any hole that will stand still,
yapping bloody murder while they slice off each other’s heads,
spewing themselves around, priesting, whoring, lording
it over little guys, messing their pants, writing gush-notes
to their grandmas, wanting somebody to do something pronto,
wanting the good thing right now and the bad stuff for the other boy.
Gullet, praise God for the gut with the patented zipper;
sing loud for the lads who sell ice boxes on the burning deck.
Dear reader, gentle reader, dainty little reader, this is
the way we go round the milktrucks and seamusic, Sike’s trap and Meg’s rib,
the wobbly sparrow with two strikes on the bible, behave
Alfred, your pokus is out; I used to collect old ladies,
pickling them in brine and painting mustaches on their bellies,
later I went in for stripteasing before Save Democracy Clubs;
when the joint was raided we were all caught with our pants down.
But I will say this: I like butter on both sides of my bread
and my sister can rape a Hun any time she’s a mind to,
or the Yellow Peril for that matter; Hector, your papa’s in the lobby.
The old days were different; the ball scores meant something then,
two pill in the side pocket and two bits says so; he got up slow see,
shook the water out of his hair, wam, tell me that ain’t a sweet left hand;
I told her what to do and we did it, Jesus I said, is your name McCoy?
Maybe it was the beer or because she was only sixteen but I got hoarse
just thinking about her; married a john who travels in cotton underwear.
Now you take today; I don’t want it. Wessex, who was that with I saw you lady?
Tony gave all his dough to the church; Lizzie believed in feeding her own face;
and that’s why you’ll never meet a worm who isn’t an antichrist, my friend,
I mean when you get down to a brass tack you’ll find some sucker sitting on it.
Whereas. Muckle’s whip and Jessie’s rod, boyo, it sure looks black
in the gut of this particular whale. Hilda, is that a .38 in your handbag?


Ghosts in packs like dogs grinning at ghosts
Pocketless thieves in a city that never sleeps
Chains clank, warders curse, this world is stark mad


Hey! Fatty, don’t look now but that’s a Revolution breathing down your neck. 




Speak softly; sun going down
Out of sight. Come near me now.

Dear dying fall of wings as birds
complain against the gathering dark...

Exaggerate the green blood in grass;
the music of leaves scraping space;

Multiply the stillness by one sound;
by one syllable of your name...

And all that is little is soon giant,
all that is rare grows in common beauty

To rest with my mouth on your mouth
as somewhere a star falls

And the earth takes it softly, in natural love...
Exactly as we take each other...
and go to sleep... 



In the footsteps of the walking air
Sky's prophetic chickens weave their cloth of awe
And hillsides lift green wings in somber journeying.

Night in his soft haste bumps on the shoulders of the abyss
And a single drop of dark blood covers the earth.

Now is the China of the spirit at walking
In my reaches.
A sable organ sounds in my gathered will
And love's inscrutable skeleton sings.

My seeing moves under a vegetable shroud
And dead forests stand where once Mary stood.

Sullen stone dogs wait in the groves of water ...
Though the wanderer drown, his welfare is as a fire
That burns at the bottom of the sea, warming
Unknown roads for sleep to walk upon. 




I believe that a young woman
Is standing in a circle of lions
In the other side of the sky.

In a little while I must carry her the flowers
Which only fade here; and she will not cry
If my hands are not very full.

±

Fiery antlers toss within the forests of heaven
And ocean’s plaintive towns
Echo the tread of celestial feet.
O the beautiful eyes stare down…
What have we done that we are blessèd?
What have we died that we hasten to God?

±

And all the animals are asleep again
In their separate caves.
Hairy bellies distended with their kill.
Culture blubbering in and out
Like the breath of a stranded fish.
Crucifixion in wax. The test-tube messiahs.
Immaculate fornication under the smoking walls
Of a dead world.
I dig for my death
in this thousand-watt dungheap.
There isn’t even enough clean air.
To die in.
O blood-bearded destroyer!

In other times...
(soundless barges float
down the rivers of death)
In another heart
These crimes may not flower…
What have we done that we are blessèd?
What have we damned that we are blinded?

±

Now, with my seven-holed head open
On the air whence comes a fabulous mariner
To take his place among the spheres—
The air which is God
And the mariner who is sheep—I fold
Upon myself like a bird over flames. Then
All my nightbound juices sing. Snails
Pop out of unexpected places and the long
light lances of waterbulls plunge
into the green crotch of my native land.
Eyes peer out of the seaweed that gently sways
Above the towers and salt gates of a lost world.

±

On the other side of the sky
A young woman is standing
In a circle of lions—
The young woman who is dream
And the lions which are death. 




Let us have madness openly.
O men Of my generation.
Let us follow
The footsteps of this slaughtered age:
See it trail across Time's dim land
Into the closed house of eternity
With the noise that dying has,
With the face that dead things wear--
nor ever say
We wanted more; we looked to find
An open door, an utter deed of love,
Transforming day's evil darkness;
but We found extended hell and fog Upon the earth,
and within the head
A rotting bog of lean huge graves. 




We must be slow and delicate; return
the policeman's stare with some esteem,
remember this is not a shadow play
of doves and geese but this is now
the time to write it down, record the words—
I mean we should have left some pride
of youth and not forget the destiny of men
who say goodbye to the wives and homes
they've read about at breakfast in a restaurant:
'My love.'—without regret or bitterness
obtain the measure of the stride we make,
the latest song has chosen a theme of love
delivering us from all evil—destroy. . . ?
why no. . . this too is fanciful. . . funny how
hard it is to be slow and delicate in this,
this thing of framing words to mark this grave
I mean nothing short of blood in every street
on earth can fitly voice the loss of these. 



The Dove walks with sticky feet
Upon the green crowns of the almond tree,
Its feathers smeared over with warmth
Like honey
That dips lazily down into the shadow ...

Anyone standing in that orchard.So filled with peace and sleep,
Would hardly have noticed the hill
Nearby
With its three strange wooden arms
Lifted above a throng of motionless people
- Above the helmets of Pilate's soldiers
Flashing like silver teeth in the sun. 




Tiny green birds skate over the surface of the room.
A naked girl prepares a basin with steaming water,
And in the corner away from the hearth, the red wheels
Of an up-ended chariot slowly turn.
After a long moment, the door to the other world opens
And the golden figure of a man appears. He stands
Ruddy as a salmon beside the niche where are kept
The keepsakes of the Prince of Earth; then sadly, drawing
A hammer out of his side, he advances to an oaken desk,
And being careful to strike in exact fury, pounds it to bits.
Another woman has by now taken her station
Beside the bubbling tub.
Her legs are covered with a silken blue fur,
Which in places above the knees
Grows to the thickness of a lion's mane.
The upper sphere of her chest
Is gathered into huge creases by two jeweled pins.
Transparent little boots reveal toes
Which an angel could want.
Beneath her on the floor a beautiful cinnamon cat
Plays with a bunch of yellow grapes, running
Its paws in and out like a boy being a silly king.
Her voice is round and white as she says:
'Your bath is ready, darling. Don't wait too long.'
But he has already drawn away to the window
And through its circular opening looks,
As a man into the pages of his death.
'Terrible horsemen are setting fire to the earth.
Houses are burning ... the people fly before
The red spears of a speckled madness . . .'
'Please, dear,' interrupts the original woman,
'We cannot help them ... Under the cancerous foot
Of their hatred, they were born to perish -
Like beasts in a well of spiders ...
Come now, sweet; the water will get cold.'
A little wagon pulled by foxes lowers from the ceiling.
Three men are seated on its cushions which breathe
Like purple breasts. The head of one is tipped
To the right, where on a bed of snails, a radiant child
Is crowing sleepily; the heads of the other two are turned
Upward, as though in contemplation
Of an authority which is not easily apprehended.
Yet they act as one, lifting the baby from its rosy perch,
And depositing it gently in the tub.
The water hisses over its scream ... a faint smell
Of horror floats up. Then the three withdraw
With their hapless burden, and the tinny bark
Of the foxes dies on the air.
'It hasn't grown cold yet,' the golden figure says,
And he strokes the belly of the second woman,
Running his hands over her fur like someone asleep.
They lie together under the shadow of a giant crab
Which polishes its thousand vises beside the fire.
Farther back, nearly obscured by kettles and chairs,
A second landscape can be seen; then a third, fourth,
Fifth ... until the whole, fluted like a rose,
And webbed in a miraculous workmanship,
Ascends unto the seven thrones
Where Tomorrow sits.
Slowly advancing down these shifting levels,
The white Queen of Heaven approaches.
Stars glitter in her hair. A tree grows
Out of her side, and gazing through the foliage
The eyes of the Beautiful gleam - 'Hurry, darling,'
The first woman calls. 'The water is getting cold.'
But he does not hear.
The hilt of the knife is carved like a scepter
And like a scepter gently sways
Above his mutilated throat ...
Smiling like a fashionable hat, the furry girl
Walks quickly to the tub, and throwing off
Her stained gown, eels into the water.
The other watches her sorrowfully; then,
Without haste, as one would strangle an owl,
She flicks the wheel of the chariot - around
Which the black world bends ...
    without thrones or gates, without faith,
    warmth or light for any of its creatures;
    where even the children go mad - and
As though unwound on a scroll, the picture
Of Everyman's murder winks back at God.
Farther away now, nearly hidden by the human,
Another landscape can be seen ...
And the wan, smiling Queen of Heaven appears
For a moment on the balconies of my chosen sleep. 




So it is the duty of the artist to discourage all traces of shame
To extend all boundaries
To fog them in right over the plate
To kill only what is ridiculous
To establish problem
To ignore solutions
To listen to no one
To omit nothing
To contradict everything
To generate the free brain
To bear no cross
To take part in no crucifixion
To tinkle a warning when mankind strays
To explode upon all parties
To wound deeper than the soldier
To heal this poor obstinate monkey once and for all

To verify the irrational
To exaggerate all things
To inhibit everyone
To lubricate each proportion
To experience only experience

To set a flame in the high air
To exclaim at the commonplace alone
To cause the unseen eyes to open

To admire only the abrsurd
To be concerned with every profession save his own
To raise a fortuitous stink on the boulevards of truth and beauty
To desire an electrifiable intercourse with a female alligator
To lift the flesh above the suffering
To forgive the beautiful its disconsolate deceit

To flash his vengeful badge at every abyss

To HAPPEN

It is the artist’s duty to be alive
To drag people into glittering occupations

To blush perpetually in gaping innocence
To drift happily through the ruined race-intelligence
To burrow beneath the subconscious
To defend the unreal at the cost of his reason
To obey each outrageous inpulse
To commit his company to all enchantments. 




These of living emanate a formidable light,
Which is equal to death, and when used
Gives increase eternally.
What fortifies in separate thought
Is not drawn by wind or by man defiled.
So whispers the parable of doubleness.
As it is necessary not to submit
To power which weakens the hidden forms;
It is extraordinarily more essential
Not to deny welcome to these originating forces
When they gather within our heat
To give us habitation.
The one life must be attempted with the other,
That we may embark upon the fiery work
For which we were certainly made.


What has been separated from the mother,
Must again be joined; for we were born of spirit,
And to spirit all mortal things return,
As it is necessary in the method of earth.
So sings the parable of singleness.
My comforter does not conceal his face;
I have seen appearances that were not marshalled
By sleep.
Perhaps I am to be stationed
At the nets which move through this completing sea.
Or I have hunting on my sign.


Yet the ground is visible,
The center of our seeing. (The houses rest
Like sentinels on this hawking star.
Two women are bathing near a trestle;
Their bodies dress the world in golden birds;
The skin of their throats is a dancing flute. . .
How alter or change? How properly
Find an exact equation? What is flying
Anywhere that is more essential to our quest?
Even the lake. . . boat walking on its blue streets;
Organ of thunder muttering in the sky. . . A tiger
Standing on the edge of a plowed field. . .
What is necessary? What is inseparable to know?
The children seek silvery-pretty caves. . .
What are we to teach?)
The distance is not great
To worlds of magnificent joy or nowhere.

The Deer And The Snake - Poem by Kenneth Patchen
Autoplay next video

The deer is humble, lovely as God made her
I watch her eyes and think of wonder owned

These strange priests enter the cathedral of woods
And seven Marys clean their hands to woo her

Foot lifted, dagger-sharp—her ears
Poised to their points like a leaf's head

But the snake strikes, in a velvet arc
Of murderous speed—assassin beautiful

As mountain water at which a fawn drank
Stand there, forever, while poison works
While I stand counting the arms of your Cross
Thinking that many Christs could hang there, crying. 


And all that is this day. . .
The boy with cap slung over what had been a face. ..

Somehow the cop will sleep tonight, will make love to his
wife...
Anger won't help. I was born angry. Angry that my father was
being burnt alive in the mills; Angry that none of us knew
anything but filth, and poverty. Angry because I was that very
one somebody was supposed To be fighting for
Turn him over; take a good look at his face...
Somebody is going to see that face for a long time.
I wash his hands that in the brightness they will shine.
We have a parent called the earth.
To be these buds and trees; this tameless bird Within the
ground; this season's act upon the fields of Man.
To be equal to the littlest thing alive,
While all the swarming stars move silent through The merest
flower
. .. but the fog of guns.
The face with all the draining future left blank. . . Those smug
saints, whether of church or Stalin, Can get off the back of
my people, and stay off. Somebody is supposed to be fighting
for somebody. . . And Lenin is terribly silent, terribly silent
and dead. 



A beast stands at my eye.

I cook my senses in a dark fire.
The old wombs rot and the new mother
Approaches with the footsteps of a world.

Who are the people of this unscaled heaven?
What beckons?
Whose blood hallows this grim land?
What slithers along the watershed of my human sleep?

The other side of knowing ...
Caress of unwaking delight ... O start
A sufficient love! O gently silent forms
Of the last spaces. 



The Orange bears with soft friendly eyes
Who played with me when I was ten,
Christ, before I'd left home they'd had
Their paws smashed in the rolls, their backs
Seared by hot slag, their soft trusting
Bellies kicked in, their tongues ripped
Out, and I went down through the woods
To the smelly crick with Whitman
In the Haldeman-Julius edition,
And I just sat there worrying my thumbnail
Into the cover---What did he know about
Orange bears with their coats all stunk up with soft coal
And the National Guard coming over
From Wheeling to stand in front of the millgates
With drawn bayonets jeering at the strikers?

I remember you would put daisies
On the windowsill at night and in
The morning they'd be so covered with soot
You couldn't tell what they were anymore.

A hell of a fat chance my orange bears had! 



The sleds of the children
Move down the right slope.
To the left, hazed in the tumbling air,
A thousand lights smudge
Within the branches of the old forest,
Like colored moons in a well of milk.


The sleds of the children
Make no sound on the hard-packed snow.
Their bright cries are not heard
On that strange hill.
The youngest are wrapped
In cloth of gold, and their scarfs
Have been dipped in blood.
All the others, from the son
Of Tegos, who is the Bishop
Of Black Church—near Tarn,
On to the daughter of the least slut,
Are garbed in love's shining dress;
Naked little eels, they flash
Across the amazed ice.
And behind each sled
There trots a man with his sex
Held like a whip in his snaking hand.


But no one sees the giant horse
That climbs the steps which stretch forth
Between the calling lights and that hill
Straight up to the throne of God.
He is taller than the highest tree
And his flanks steam under the cold moon.
The beat of his heart shakes the sky
And his reaching muzzle snuffles
At the most ancient star.


*


The innocent alone approach evil
Without fear; in their appointed flame
They acknowledge all living things.
The only evil is doubt; the only good
Is not death, but life. To be is to love.
This I thought as I stood while the snow
Fell in that bitter place, and the riders
Rode their motionless sleds into a nowhere
Of sleep. Ah, God, we can walk so easily,
Bed with women, do every business
That houses and roads are for, scratch
Our shanks and lug candles through
These caves; but, God, we can't believe,
We can't believe in anything.
Because nothing is pure enough.
Because nothing will ever happen
To make us good in our own sight.
Because nothing is evil enough.


*


I squat on my heels, raise my head
To the moon, and howl.
I dig my nails into my sides,
And laugh when the snow turns red.
As I bend to drink,
I laugh at everything that anyone loves.


All your damn horses climbing to heaven 




That should be obvious
Of course it won't
Any fool knows that.
Even in the winter.
Consider for a moment.
What?
Consider what!
They never have.
Why now?
Certainly it means nothing.
It's all a lie.
What else could it be?
That's right.
Sure.
Any way you look at it.
A silk hat.
A fat belly.
A nice church to squat in.
My holy ass...
What should they care about?
It's quaint.
Twelve kids on the fire escape...
Flowers on the windowsill...
You're damn right.
That's the way it is.
That's just the way it is. 




The snow is deep on the ground.
Always the light falls
Softly down on the hair of my belovèd.


This is a good world.
The war has failed.
God shall not forget us.
Who made the snow waits where love is.


Only a few go mad.
The sky moves in its whiteness
Like the withered hand of an old king.
God shall not forget us.
Who made the sky knows of our love.


The snow is beautiful on the ground.
And always the lights of heaven glow
Softly down on the hair of my belovèd. 


 To leave the earth was my wish, and no will stayed my rising.
Early, before sun had filled the roads with carts
Conveying folk to weddings and to murders;
Before men left their selves of sleep, to wander
In the dark of the world like whipped beasts.

I took no pack. I had no horse, no staff, no gun.
I got up a little way and something called me,
Saying,
'Put your hand in mine. We will seek God together.'
And I answered, 'It is your father who is lost, not mine.'
Then the sky filled with tears of blood, and snakes sang. 


We go out together into the staring town
And buy cheese and bread and little jugs with
flowered labels

Everywhere is a tent where we put on our whirling
show

A great deal has been said of the handless serpents
Which war has set loose in the gay milk of our
heads

But because you braid your hair and taste like
honey of heaven
We go together into town to buy wine and
yellow candles. 




If in a shimmering room the babies came. 
Drawn close by dreams of fledgling wing. 
It was because night nursed them in its fold. 

Night nursed not him in whose dark mind 

The clambering wings of birds of black revolved^ 

Making harsh torment of the solitude. 

The walker in the moonlight walked alone> 

And in his heart his disbelief lay cold. 

His broad-brimmed hat came close upon his eyes. 

FROM THE MISERY OF DON JOOST 

I have finished my combat with the sun; 
And my body, the old animal^ 
Knows nothing more. 

The powerful seasons bred and killed, 
And were themselves the genii 
Of their own ends. 

Oh, but the very self of the storm 
Of sun and slaves, breeding and death, 
The old animal — 

The senses and feeling, the very sound 
And sight, and all there was of the storm — 
Knows nothing more. 


Wallace Stevens 



THE DOCTOR OF GENEVA 



The doctor of Geneva stamped the sand 
That lay impounding the Pacific swell. 
Patted his stove-pipe hat and tugged his shawl. 

Lacustrine man had never been assailed 
By such long-rolling opulent cataracts, 
Unless Racine or Bossuet held the like. 

He did not quail. A man so used to plumb 
The multifarious heavens felt no awe 
Before these visible, voluble delugings. 

Which yet found means to set his simmering mind 
Spinning and hissing with oracular 
Notations of the wild, the ruinous waste, 

Until the steeples of his city clanked and sprang 

In an unburgherly apocalypse. 

The doctor used his handkerchief and sighed. 

GUBBINAL 

That strange flower, the sun. 
Is just what you say. 
Have it your way. 

The world is ugly. 
And the people are sad. 

That tuft of jungle feathers, 
That animal eye, 
Is just what you say. 

That savage of fire, 
That seed — 
Have it your way. 

The world is ugly, 
And the people are sad. 



THE SNOW MAN 

One must have a mind of winter 
To regard the frost and the boughs 
Of the pine-trees crusted with snow; 

And have been cold a long time 

To behold the junipers shagged with ice, 

The spruces rough in the distant glitter 

Of the January sun; and not to think 
Of any misery in the sound of the wind, 
In the sound of a few leaves, 

Which is the sound of the land 

Full of the same wind 

That is blowing in the same bare place 


Wallace Stevens 



For the listener, who listens in the snow, 

And, nothing himself, beholds 

Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is. 



TEA AT THE PALAZ OF HOOK 

Not less because in purple I descended 
Th» western day through what you called 
The loneliest air, not less was I myself. 

What was the ointment sprinkled on my beard? 
What were the hymns that buzzed beside my ears? 
What was the sea whose tide swept through me there? 

Out of my mind the golden ointment rained, 
And my ears made the blowing hymns they heard. 
I was myself the compass of that sea: 

I was the world in which I walked, and what I saw 

Or heard or felt came not but from myself; 

And there I found myself more truly and more strange. 



THE CUBAN DOCTOR 

I went to Egypt to escape 

The Indian, but the Indian struck 

Out of his cloud and from his sky. 

This was no worm bred in the moon, 
Wriggling far down the phantom air, 
And on a comfortable sofa dreamed. 

The Indian struck and disappeared. 
I knew my enemy was near — I, 
Drowsing in summer's sleepiest horn. 



ANOTHER WEEPING WOMAN 

Pour the unhappiness out 
From your too bitter heart, 
Which grieving will not sweeten. 

Poison grows in this dark. 
It is in the water of tears 
Its black blooms rise. 

The magnificent cause of being — 
The imagination, the one reality 
In this imagined world — 

Leaves you 

With him for whom no phantasy moves. 

And you are pierced by a death. 




Wallace Stevens 



OF THE MANNER OF ADDRESSING CLOUDS 

Gloomy grammarians in golden gowns> 

Meekly you keep the mortal rendezvous, 

Eliciting the still sustaining pomps 

Of speech which are like music so profound 

They seem an exaltation without sound. 

Funest philosophers and ponderers, 

Their evocations are the speech of clouds. 

So speech of your processionals returns 

In the casual evocations of your tread 

Across the stale, mysterious seasons. These 

Are the music of meet resignation; these 

The responsive, still sustaining pomps for you 

To magnify, if in that drifting waste 

You are to be accompanied by more 

Than mute bare splendors of the sun and moon. 



OF HEAVEN CONSIDERED AS A TOMB 

What word have you, interpreters, of men 
Who in the tomb of heaven walk by night, 
The darkened ghosts of our old comedy? 
Do they believe they range the gusty cold. 
With lanterns borne aloft to light the way. 
Freemen of death, about and still about 
To find whatever it is they seek? Or does 

That burial, pillared up each day as porte 
And spiritous passage into nothingness, 
Foretell each night the one abysmal night, 
When the host shall no more wander, nor the light 
Of the steadfast lanterns creep across the dark? 
Make hue among the dark comedians. 
Halloo them in the topmost distances 
For answer from their icy Elys6e. 

THE LOAD OF SUGAR-CANE 

The going of the glade-boat 
Is like water flowing; 

Like water flowing 
Through the green saw-grass, 
Under the rainbows; 

Under the rainbows 
That are like birds, 
TuQiing, bedizened. 

While the wind still whistles 
As kildeer do. 

When they rise 
At the red turban 
Of the boatman. 


Wallace Stevens 

HIBISCUS ON THE SLEEPING SHORES 

I say now, Fernando, that on that day 
The mind roamed as a moth roams, 
Among the blooms beyond the open sand; 

And that whatever noise the motion of the waves 
Made on the sea-weeds and the covered stones 
Disturbed not even the most idle ear. 

Then it was that that monstered moth 
Which had lain folded against the blue 
And the colored purple of the lazy sea, 

And which had drowsed along the bony shores, 
Shut to the blather that the water made. 
Rose up besprent and sought the flaming red 

Dabbled with yellow pollen — red as red 

As the flag above the old caf6 — 

And roamed there all the stupid afternoon. 

Wallace Stevens 



FROM CITY LANES 

The dawn comes to me sweetly^ as a soft new child 
Leans with its soul to drain a bit of milk. 
And I am new. 

gray old city^ 

Lift your head a moment from the pots and streets — 
fVash over me your meaning as a flask of fire 
Tipped and spilled over at the altar* s base. 

There are new augurings that go in blue-gray smoke 
Up from your shops y 

New lips that rain a torrent in me as of words. 
Be still a moment y cityy while the dawn tells tales. 

CITY WED 

1 lie by the bricks at night — 

Do you think I am lying by you, 

And this is your breast I lean against? 

No. Bricks are my lord — 

With them I shall procreate, 

Until I wake some morning with my litter of stone. 

Not that I want to lie with bricks, 

O beloved of the white limbs and strong neck! 

But how can I help it when they come tumbling — 

These bricks that come fumbling 

At my breast?

IF 



If it were not for this dream upon me, 

I should make my coin; 

I should grind my way to fortune with the little wheels, 

I should count the flying heels my slaves to bind, 

I should count the eardrums and the fingers mine. . . . 

But I keep thinking I can touch the sky 

With my lips. 

ELEVATOR MAN 

You in your little cage and I in mine. 

Elevator man. 

We will pierce the wide world's heaven 

Far as we can: 

You to go up and down, beating up and down; 

I to brush my wings ofF 

On the walls of Merchant Town. 

BEREFT 

my country, 

1 am crying to you piteously as a hungry bird, 
I am crying to you for your beautiful ports 
And harbors. 

For the slow beauty of your Statue and its silent hope. 
O my country, I would slink into the crevices of your 

egoism. 
And squat on the doormat of your excellences. 

[II] 



 



POETRY: A Magazine of Ferse 

But what shall I do when mad spring comes, 
And blossoms come, 
And wild sap comes — 
But my lover comes not? 

O my country, I might be a thin thread in your flag, 
Or the little wind blowing your ships to sea; 
But what shall I do when the spring comes in, 
And flowers shoot up in me? 



OLD MAN 

Dawn sprang wildly to her lips, 

And the little hard breasts burst as a waterfall over the 

rocks. 
I, the dark pine at the precipice edge. 
Lunged and was still; 
Then swiftly, as wild birds go to the kill. 
Toppled, and ran with her youth to the sea. 

They said I was wanton and cruel 

To have taken her youth at the height. 

To have matched the great might 

Of my years 

With her slender beauty and tremulous fears. 

I tell you, I lunged and was still; 

Then swiftly, as wild birds go to the kill, 


Loureine Aber 



Toppled, and ran with her youth to the sea. 
Pity me! 

GIRL 

Dreamily, girl — 

Duskily, night, 

Cover your dead. 

Make a plot by the old stream's head. 

Plant him and pray 

Till worlds make way 

And the blooms come. 

Duskily, night — 
Dreamily, girl. 

DEATH 



I am waiting for the white winds to come. 

White with the long-whispering dust, 

Withered under hoofs and feet. 

White with the mountains that blow their sleep 

Into the sea. 

I am waiting for the white winds to come. 

Lifting their hands as beautiful women clad for the moon; 

And soon, ah soon, 

Lifting my heart to be ashes and wind.

POEMS 

JOY 

Joy, Joy, run over me 

Like water over a shining stone; 

And I beneath your sweet shall be 

No longer hungry and alone. 

The light at my heart's gate is lit — 

My love, my love is tending it! 

CEREMONY 

The unpeopled conventional rose garden 

Is where I shall take my heart 

With this new pain. 

Clipped hedge and winter-covered beds 

Shall ease its hurt. 

When it has grown quiet, 

I shall mount the steps, slowly, 

And put three sorrows in the terra-cotta urn 

On that low gate-pillar. 

And leave them there, to sleep, 

Beneath the brooding stillness of a twisted pine. 

FIRST COMER 

Gold bee, 

You cling too still and drowsily 


Maurine Smith 

In the frosty noon. 

Think you 

The dandelion is a sun 

To warm your body through? 

WIND 

Gulls take veering way 

Through the fresh day; 

Crisp brown oak-leaves whirl and rise. 

Though my heart flies, 

I must go 

Carefully and slow. 

Eager is the wind> shy 

As any butterfly — 

ril not blur life with my frosty breath, 

Nor think again of death ! 

SWALLOWS BRUSH A POOL 

Let there be end of talk of good and evil, 
Thirst, hunger and the rest . . . Beauty has given 
The white gift of a cherry petal 
To brood upon.

THREE SMALL POEMS 



TO GET WISDOM 

I will spread out my mind 
As the wind spreads the skies; 
I will make my heart Argus, 
Full of love's eyes: 
So shall I grow 
Abysmally wise. 

MEEKNESS AND PRIDE 

Meekness and Pride 
Are fruits of one tree; 
Eat of them both 
For mastery: 
Take one of Pride — 
Of the other, three. 

COURAGE 

4 

Courage is armor 

A blind man wears, 

The calloused scar 

Of outlived despairs : 

Courage is Fear 

That has said its prayers.

NOT IN THE WHIRLWIND 

Do I speak soft and little — 

Do I offer you a drop of honey in a bent brown leaf? 

Yet I too have been rent by the whirlwind: 

I have lain trembling under its bellowings; 

I have endured its fangs; 

I have heard it hiss and groan, "Bitterness, bitterness!" 

But all I have left, 

After its searchings and its rendings. 

May be told in a soft voice 

And is sweet — 

Sweet, 

Like a drop of thick honey in a bent brown leaf. 

Karle Wilson Baker 



KEEP MY HAND 

Keep my hand, because I am afraid 

To be alone — 
I am afraid of all the dreams I made. 

If you were shown 
Dream after little dream that I made gay 
To keep my spirit strong upon the way, 
You would hold my hand closer than you do 

Within your own! 

Louise Driscoll 


UNDER THE CLIFF 

SHADOW CANYON 

The earth has carved a hollow cup. 

In which, most delicately set. 
Tall redwood boughs are lifted up, 

To form a sky-enlacing net. 

There, on the ground made green with fern. 
The sunshine lies in pools of light; 

And iris holds a fragile urn, 
With morning's gems of dew bedight. 

There is no sound but water going. 
And sunlight thrilling through the air. 

There is no breath but breezes blowing. 
And wild quail rustling to their lair. 

Here is a deep and drowsing haven, 
That woven sun-rays pierce and cross; 

And on the peaceful trees are graven 
The little footprints of the moss. 

Sweet dreaming canyon, shadow-bound 
Yet sunshine-stippled all the day, 

The calm skies circle you around. 
But you lie deeper hushed than they!

THEMES 



"I remember" and "I wish*'— 

Of such stuff are poems fashioned; 
Poems lyric with regret, 

Vibrant poems> dream-impassioned. 

In your honor and your praise 

I would strike a richer chord. 
Sing: "I have you and am yours, 

O adorer and adored!" 

WILL IT BE LIKE THIS? 

Will it be like this?— 

Climbing the hill at midnight. 

While the rain seeps from the plumaged pepper-trees, 

And the damp air is rank with eucalyptus; 

And our little house black and untenanted. 

Soundless, where your hurrying footsteps 

Used to run to the door to greet me; 

Black, and cold, and I alone there? 

Will that be the way of it, 

On that silent day when I shall begin waiting 

For Death to release me to you?

SIC PASSIM 

The Angel. Now here's the road to Allencourt, 
And here's the road to Tyre. 
And he who goes to Allencourt 
Is purged of all desire. 

The Youth. But what of him who goes to Tyre, 

Among the cedar trees? 
The Angel. Why, he who goes to Tyre has none 

But just himself to please. 

While he who goes to Allencourt 
Across the Hills of Pain 
Must love his fellow very well. 
And count no thing as gain 

That wounds another. He must keep 
His eyes upon the crest 
Of that high'hill, where he at last 
Through virtue shall find rest. 

The Youth, But what of him who goes to Tyre, 

Along the road of ease? 
The Angel. Why, he who goes to Tyre has none 

But just himself to please; 

While he who goes to Allencourt, 
And does not lose his way 
Among the thorns and brambles, comes 
To rich reward some day. 



The Old Man, Ah, why are thorns and brambles set 

To make the road a care? 
The AngeL Why, man himself, most carelessly, 

Has placed the brambles there. 

The Youth. But what of him who goes to Tyre 

Beside the sunny seas? 
The AngeL Why, he who goes to Tyre has none 

But just himself to please. 

The Old Man. And what's the toll to Allencourt? 
The Youth. And what's the toll to Tyre? 
The AngeL Why, he who goes to Allencourt 
Is purged of all desire. 

The toll is love — a brother's love — 
For man in full sincerity. 
And all the peace that God has willed 
Is the reward — eternally. 

But toll upon the other road 
Is crucible of burn and freeze: 
For he who goes to Tyre has none 
But just himself to please. 

While he who goes to Allencourt 

Is purged of all desire . . . 
The Old Man. Lord, lead me on to Allencourt! 
The Youth. For me, I go to Tyre. 

RECALLED 

You see it not . . . ? This Rose of Rhone 

Has something of the flow 

Of light — like a liquid lacquer on the wall. 

And old Madrid — I swear, it shone 

More with your light, your glow. 

Than that of the sun. Why do your eyelids fall? 

You hear it not . . . ? The Prado was 

A sweeping meadow then: 

The swing of the tunes of time was in your tone. 

No dream comes to you now because 

You hear my voice again — 

No dream of a youth you passed at dusk alone? 

Three hundred years . . • ! you mark them not? 

And yet — you loved mc then, 

Who now in the light of muUioned windows stand. 

And it is you who have forgot 

That once, O sought of men! — 

When I was the king of Spain I kissed your hand.

SEA QUATRAINS 

I 
Too fast the silly white-^aps run 

Their helter-skelter races; 
They stumble when the goal is won 

And fall upon their faces. 
II 
A purple light is shaken over 

The greener ocean shadows, 
Like clover on the cooler depths 

Of grass in upland meadows. 
Ill 
The sea hangs kelp upon the sand 

Like garlands on a grave. 
Mourning the dead and silent land 

With every living wave. 

IV 

The breakers thunder in the night 
With which the sea is drenched. 

Only one plunging line is white; 
Even the stars are quenched. 

V 

The fairest ship ever a wreck 

Had not so white a sail 
As this fair wave cast up to break. 

Driven before the gale.

SONG 



These are the words of the wind: 

Over your white body shall pass 

Whorls of water, whorls of light. 

Of the lustre of blown glass. 
These are the words of the wind. 

You are beloved of the silence 

And the grey still rain. 
Once the sun loved you utterly, 

And shall love you again. 

These are the words of the wind: 

Over your white body shall pass 

Whorls of water, whorls of light, 

Of the lustre of blown glass. 
These are the words of the wind. 

LAKE 

You are a broad white lake, 

Silent. 

On your surface people launch their brown sun-warmed 

souls. 
Reflected in you, they see themselves 
Tall, profound, mystical.
