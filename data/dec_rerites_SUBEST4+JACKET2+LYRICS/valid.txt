Must be revealed to light. 
We're not here to judge what's good from bad 
But to do the things that are right. 
 
On a hot, sunny day, 
Follow the shadows for rescue. 
But as the day grows old, 
I know the sun is gonna find you. 
 
Be not selfish in your doings: 
Pass it on. 
Help your brothers in their needs: 
Pass it on. 
 
Live for yourself, you will live in vain;

REDEMPTION SONG

 Old pirates, yes, they rob I; 
Sold I to the merchant ships, 
Minutes after they took I 
From the bottomless pit. 
But my hand was made strong 
By the 'and of the Almighty. 
We forward in this generation 
Triumphantly. 
Won't you help to sing 
These songs of freedom? 
'Cause all I ever have: 
Redemption songs; 
Redemption songs. 
 
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery; 
None but ourselves can free our minds. 
Have no fear for atomic energy, 
'Cause none of them can stop the time. 
How long shall they kill our prophets, 
While we stand aside and look? Ooh! 
Some say it's just a part of it: 
We've got to fulfil de book.

WAITING IN VAIN

 1, 2, 3: 
 
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love; 
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love. 
From the very first time I rest my eyes on you, girl, 
My heart says follow t'rough. 
But I know, now, that I'm way down on your line, 
But the waitin' feel is fine: 
So don't treat me like a puppet on a string, 
'Cause I know I have to do my thing. 
Don't talk to me as if you think I'm dumb; 
I wanna know when you're gonna come soon. 
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love; 
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love; 
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love,

I'm still waiting there;

And I'm still waiting there.

Soul train is coming our way; 


 



A BOX FOR BLACK PAUL

 Who'll build a box for Black Paul? 
Ah'm enquirin on behalf of his soul 
Ah'd be beholdin to ya all 
For a lil information, just a little indication 
Just who'll dig the hole? 
When ya done ransackin' his room 
grabbin any damn thing that shines, 
throw the scraps down on the street 
Like all his books and his notes. 
All his books and his notes and 
All the junk that he wrote 
the whole fucken lot right up in smoke 
Ain't there nuthin sacred anymore 
Won't someone will build a box for Black Paul? 
And their shootin off his guns 
and their shootin off their mouths 
saying 'Fuck with us ... and die!' 
'Fuck with us ... and die!' 
(Let's see that rat of fear go scuttle in their skulls) 
'Cover that eye! Cover that frozen eye!' 
 
Black puppet, in a heap up against the stoning wall 
Black puppet, go to sleep, ma ma won't scold ya anymore 
 
Armies of ants, wade up the lil red streams 
they're headin for the mother pool 
O lord, it's cruel! O man it's hot! O man it's hot and 
And some of them ants they just climb to the spot 
Who threw the first stone at Black Paul? 
 
'Don't ask us', say the critics and the hacks 
The pen pushers and the quacks 
'We jes cum to git dah facks!' 
'We jes cum to git dah facks!' 
Hey, hey, hey, hey... 
 
Here is the hammer, that built the scaffold, 
and built the box... 
Here is the shovel, that dug the hole, 
in this ground of rocks... 
And here is the pile of stones! 
and for each one planted, God only knows, 
a blood rose grown... 
These are the true Demon Flowers! 
These are the true Demon Flowers! 
Stand back everyone! Blood black everyone! 
 
Who'll build a box for Black Paul? 
Who'll carry it up the hill? 
 
'Not I', said the widow, adjusting her veil 
'Ah will not drive the nail 
Or cart his puppet body home, 
For ah done that one hundred times before, 
Yeah! ah done that one hundred times or more, 
And why should ah dress his wounds? 
When he has wounded my dress, nightly, 
Right across the floor' 
 
Who'll build a box for Black Paul? 
Who'll carry it up the hill? 
Who'll bury it in the black soil? 
And from the woods and the thickets 
Come the ghosts of his victims 
'We love you!' 
'Ah love you!' 
'and this will not hurt a bit, 
Outta my eyes was your rise to full glory 
Spring up from the corp of life 
we'll go up, up, up, up, up into Death 
up, up, up, up, inhale its breath 
O yes, Death favours those that favor Death' 
 
Here is the stone, and this is the inscription it bare: 
'Below Lies Black Paul, Under The Upper... 
But Above and Beyond The Surface Flat Fall There.' 
 
And all the angels come on down, 
And all you men and women crowd around 
And all the old widows weeping into their skirts 
And all the lil gals and the lil Boys 
And the scribes with their pens poised 
All the hullaballoo, all the norse 
All the hullaballoo, all the noise 
All the hullaballoo, all of the noise 
clears his throat of black blood 
singin Black Paul like a lonely boy... 
 
We e e ll, ah have cried one thousand tears 
Ah've cried a thousand tears, its true 
And the next stormy night you know, 
That ah'm still cryin them for you 
 
Well, ah had a gal she was so sweet, 
Red dress, and long red hair hangin down 
And heaven yes ain't heaven 
Without that lil girl hangin around 
 
Well, ya know ah've beenn a bad man 
and Lord knows ah done some good things too 
But ah confess, my soul will never rest 
Until you've, until you've build 
Until you've built a box for my gal, too. 
my gal, too 
my gal, too

 


AIN'T GONNA RAIN ANYMORE

 Once there came a storm in the form of a girl 
It blew to pieces my snug little world 
Sometimes I swear I can still hear her howl 
Down through the wreckage and the ruins 
 
And it ain't gonna rain anymore 
Now my baby's gone 
And it ain't gonna rain anymore 
Now my baby's gone 
 
Now the storm has passed over me 
I'm left to drift on a dead calm sea 
And watch her forever through the cracks in the beams 
Nailed across the doorways of the bedrooms of my dreams 
 
And it ain't gonna rain anymore 
Now my baby's gone 
And it ain't gonna rain anymore 
Now my baby's gone 
 
Now I got no one to hold 
Now I am all alone again 
It ain't too hot but it ain't too cold 
And there is no sign of rain 
 
And it ain't gonna rain anymore 
Now my baby's gone 
And it ain't gonna rain anymore 
Now my baby's gone 
And I'm 
Here I'm on my own 
 
She ain't coming back no more 
She ain't coming back no more 
She ain't coming back no more 
Say what you will, I don't care 
 
And it ain't gonna rain anymore 
Now my baby's gone, yeah 
And it ain't gonna rain anymore 
Now my baby has gone

 


ALL TOMORROW'S PARTIES

 And what costume shall the poor girl wear 
To all tomorrow's parties 
A hand me down dress from who knows where 
To all tomorrow's parties 
 
And where will she go and what shall she do 
When midnight comes around 
She'll turn once more to Sunday's gown 
And cry behind the door 
 
And what costume shall the poor girl wear 
To all tomorrow's parties 
Why silks and plumes of yesterday's gowns 
To all tomorrow's parties 
 
And what shall she do with Thursday's rags 
When Monday comes around 
She'll turn once more to Sunday's clown 
And cry behind the door 
 
And what costume shall the poor girl wear 
To all tomorrow's parties 
For Thursday's child is Sunday's clown 
For whom none will go mourning 
 
A blackened shroud, a hand me down gown 
Of rags and silks, a costume 
Fit for one who sits and cries 
For all tomorrow's parties

 


AND NO MORE SHALL WE PART

 And no more shall we part 
It will no longer be necessary 
And no more will I say, dear heart 
I am alone and she has left me 
 
And no more shall we part 
The contracts are drawn up, the ring is locked upon the finger 
And never again will my letters start 
Sadly, or in the depths of winter 
 
And no more shall we part 
All the hatchets have been buried now 
And all of birds will sing to your 
beautiful heart 
Upon the bough 
 
And no more shall we part 
Your chain of command has been silenced now 
And all of those birds would've sung to your beautiful heart 
Anyhow 
 
Lord, stay by me 
Don't go down 
I will never be free 
If I'm not free now 
 
Lord, stay by me 
Don't go down 
I never was free 
What are you talking about? 
 
For no more shall we part 
And no more shall we part

 


AS I SAT SADLY BY HER SIDE

 As I sat sadly by her side 
At the window, through the glass 
She stroked a kitten in her lap 
And we watched the world as it fell past 
Softly she spoke these words to me 
And with brand new eyes, open wide 
We pressed our faces to the glass 
As I sat sadly by her side 
 
She said, Father, mother, sister, brother, 
Uncle, aunt, nephew, niece, 
Soldier, sailor, physician, labourer, 
Actor, scientist, mechanic, priest 
Earth and moon and sun and stars 
Planets and comets with tails blazing 
All are there forever falling 
Falling lovely and amazing 
 
Then she smiled and turned to me 
And waited for me to reply 
Her hair was falling down her shoulders 
As I sat sadly by her side 
 
As I sat sadly by her side 
The kitten she did gently pass 
Over to me and again we pressed 
Our different faces to the glass 
 That may be very well , I said 
 But watch the one falling in the street 
See him gesture to his neighbours 
See him trampled beneath their feet 
All outward motion connects to nothing 
For each is concerned with their immediate need 
Witness the man reaching up from the gutter 
See the other one stumbling on who can not see 
 
With trembling hand I turned toward her 
And pushed the hair out of her eyes 
The kitten jumped back to her lap 
As I sat sadly by her side 
 
Then she drew the curtains down 
And said, When will you ever learn 
That what happens there beyond the glass 
Is simply none of your concern? 
God has given you but one heart 
You are not a home for the hearts of your brothers 
 
And God does not care for your benevolence 
Anymore than he cares for the lack of it in others 
Nor does he care for you to sit 
At windows in judgement of the world He created 
While sorrows pile up around you 
Ugly, useless and over inflated 
 
At which she turned her head away 
Great tears leaping from her eyes 
I could not wipe the smile from my face 
As I sat sadly by her side

 


AVALANCHE

 I stepped into an avalanche 
It covered up my soul 
When I am not this hunchback that you see 
I sleep beneath the golden hill 
You who wish to conquer pain 
You must learn to serve me well 
 
You strike my side by accident 
As you go down to your goal 
This cripple here that you clothe and feed 
Is neither starved nor cold 
He does not ask for your company 
Not at the centre, the centre of the world 
 
I who am on a pedestal 
You did not raise me there 
Your laws do not compel me now 
To kneel grotesque and bare 
For I myself am the pedestal 
For this ugly hump at which you stare 
 
You who wish to conquer pain 
You must learn what makes me kind 
The crumbs of love that you offer me 
Are the crumbs I've left behind 
Your pain is no credential here 
It's just a shadow of my wound 
 
I have begun to ask for you 
I who have no greed 
I have begun to long for you 
I who have no need 
You say you've gone away from me 
But I can feel you when you breathe 
 
Do not dress in those rags for me 
I know you are not poor 
And do not love me quite so fiercely now 
When you know that you are not sure 
It is your turn, my beloved one 
It is your flesh that I wear

BLACK CROW KING

 Mmmmm Mmmmm Mmmmm 
I am the black crow king 
Mmmmm Mmmmm Mmmmm 
I am the black crow king 
Keeper of the nodding corn 
Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! 
All the hammers are a talking 
All the nails are a singing 
So sweet and low 
 
You can hear it in the valley 
Where live the lame and the blind 
They climb the hill out of its belly 
They leave with mean black boots on 
 
 I just made a simple gesture 
They jumped up and nailed it to my shadow 
My gesture was a hooker 
You know, my shadow's made of timber. 
 
And the storm is a rolling 
And the storm is a rolling 
All down on me 
 
And I'm still here rolling after everybody's gone 
And I'm still here rolling after everybody's gone 
Ah'm still here rolling and I'm left on my own 
The blackbirds have all gone! 
Everyone's rolled on! 
 
I am the black crow king 
Keeper of the trodden corn 
I am the king 
Won't say it again 
And the rain, it raineth daily 
Lord 
And wash away my clothes 
I surrender up my arms 
To a company of crows 
I am the black crow king 
I won't say it again 
 
And all the thorns are a crowning 
King ruby on each spine 
And the spears are a sailing 
O my o my 
 
And the storm is a rolling 
And the storm is a rolling 
All down on me 
 
And I'm still here rolling after everybody's gone 
And I'm still here rolling after everybody's gone 
I'm still here rolling and left on my own 
Those blackbirds they have all flown and 
I am on my own 
 
I am the black crow king 
Keeper of the forgotten corn 
The King! The King! 
I'm the king of nuthin' at all 
The hammers are a talking 
The nails are a singing 
The thorns are a crowning him 
The spears are a sailing 
The crows are a mocking 
The corn is a nodding 
The storm is a rolling 
The storm is a rolling 
The storm is a rolling down 
The storm is a rolling down 
The storm is a rolling 
Down on me 
Rolling down on me 
Rolling down on me

 


BLACK HAIR

 Last night my kisses were banked in black hair 
And in my bed, my lover, her hair was midnight black 
And all her mystery dwelled within her black hair 
And her black hair framed a happy heart shaped face 
 
And heavy hooded eyes inside her black hair 
Shined at me frome the depths of her hair of deepest black 
While my fingers pushed into her straight black hair 
Pulling her black hair back from her happy heart shaped face 
 
To kiss her milk white throat, a dark curtain of black hair 
Smothered me, my lover with her beautiful black hair 
The smell of it is heavy. It is charged with life 
On my fingers the smell of her deep black hair 
 
Full of all my whispered words, her black hair 
And wet with tears and good byes, her hair of deepest black 
All my tears cried against her milk white throat 
Hidden behind the curtain of her beautiful black hair 
 
As deep as ink and black, black as the deepest sea 
The smell of her black hair upon my pillow 
Where her head and all its black hair did rest 
Today she took a train to the West 
Today she took a train to the West 
Today she took a train to the West

 


BLESS HIS EVER LOVING HEART

 Bless his ever loving heart 
Only he knows who you are 
He may seem so very far 
Bless his ever loving heart 
 
And when your feeling sad 
And everywhere you look you can't believe the things you see 
When it all comes down so bad 
And beauty lies exhausted in the streets 
 
Hold his ever loving hand 
Even when you do not understand 
Sorrow has it's (?? natural ??) end 
Hold his ever loving hand 
 
And when your feeling low 
And everyone you meet you can't believe the things they say 
When there's no place left to go 
Where someone isn't moving you a little further down the way 
 
Bless his ever loving heart 
What you do is what you are 
When it all comes down so hard 
Bless his ever loving heart 
Hold his ever loving hand 
When it seems you ain t got a friend 
 
Only he knows who you are and what you are 
Bless his ever loving heart 
Bless his ever loving heart

 


BLIND LEMON JEFFERSON

 Blind Lemon Jefferson is a coming 
Tap tap tappin with his cane 
Blind Lemon Jefferson is a coming 
Tap tap tappin with his cane 
His last ditch lies down the road of trials 
Down the road of trials 
Half filled with rain 
 
O Sycamore, Sycamore! 
Stretch your arms across the storm 
Down fly two greasy brother crows 
They hop'n'bop They hop'n'bop They hop'n'bop 
Like the tax man come to call 
They go knock knock! Knock knock! 
Hop'n'bop hop'n'bop 
They slap a death writ on his door 
 
Here come the Judgement train 
Git on board! 
And turn that big black engine home 
O let's roll! 
Let's roll! 
Down the tunnel 
The terrible tunnel of his world 
Waiting at his final station 
Like a bigger blacker third bird 
O let's roll! 
Let's roll! 
 
O his road is dark and lonely 
He don't drive no Cadillac 
O his road is dark and holy 
He don't drive no Cadillac 
If that sky serves as his eyes 
Then that moons a cataract 
 
Let's roll! 
Yeah let's roll!

 


BRING IT ON

 This garden that I built for you 
That you sit in now and yearn 
I will never leave it, dear 
I could not bear to return 
And find it all untended 
With the trees all bended low 
This garden is our home, dear 
And I got nowhere else to go 
 
So bring it on 
Bring it on 
Every little tear 
Bring it on 
Every useless fear 
Bring it on 
All your shattered dreams 
And I ll scatter them into the sea 
Into the sea 
 
The geraniums on your window sill 
The carnations, dear, and the daffodil 
Well, they re ordinary flowers 
But they long for the light of your touch 
And of your trembling will 
Ah, you re trembling still 
And I am trembling too 
To be perfectly honest I don t know 
Quite what else to do 
 
So bring it on 
Bring it on 
Every neglected dream 
Bring it on 
Every little scheme 
Bring it on 
Every little fear 
And I ll make them disappear 
 
So bring it on, bring it on 
Bring it on 
Every little thing 
Bring it on 
Every tiny fear 
Bring it on 
Every shattered dream 
And I ll scatter them into the sea

 


BROMPTON ORATORY

 Up those stone steps I climb 
Hail this joyful day's return 
Into its great shadowed vault I go 
Hail the Pentecostal morn 
 
The reading is from Luke 24 
Where Christ returns to his loved ones 
I look at the stone apostles 
Think that it's alright for some 
 
And I wish that I was made of stone 
So that I would not have to see 
A beauty impossible to define 
A beauty impossible to believe 
 
A beauty impossible to endure 
The blood imparted in little sips 
The smell of you still on my hands 
As I bring the cup up to my lips 
 
No God up in the sky 
No devil beneath the sea 
Could do the job that you did, baby 
Of bringing me to my knees 
 
Outside I sit on the stone steps 
With nothing much to do 
Forlorn and exhausted, baby 
By the absence of you

BROTHER, MY CUP IS EMPTY

 Brother, my cup is empty 
And I haven't got a penny 
For to buy no more whiskey 
I have to go home 
 
I am the captain of my pain 
Tis the bit, the bridle, 
The trashing cane 
The stirrup, the harness 
The whipping mane 
The pickled eye 
The shrinking brain 
O brother, buy me one more drink 
I'll explain the nature of my pain 
Yes, let me tell you once again 
I am the captain of my pain 
 
O brother, my cup is empty 
And I haven't got a penny 
For to buy no more whiskey 
I have to go home 
 
I cannot blame it all on her 
To blame her all would be a lie 
For many a night I lay awake 
And wished that I could watch her die 
To see her accusing finger spurt 
To see flies swarm her hateful eye 
To watch her groaning in the dirt 
To see her clicking tongue crack dry 
O brother, buy me one more drink 
One more drink and then goodbye 
And do not mock me when I say 
Let's drink one more before I die 
 
O brother, my cup is empty 
And I haven't got a penny 
For to buy no more whiskey 
I have to go home 
 
Well I've been sliding down on rainbows 
Well I've been swinging from the stars 
Now this wretch in beggars clothing 
Bangs his cup across the bars 
Look, this cup of mine is empty! 
Seems I've misplaced my desires 
Seems I'm sweeping up the ashes 
Of all my former fires 
So brother, be a brother 
And fill this tiny cup of mine 
And please, sir, make it whiskey 
For I have no head for wine 
 
O brother, my cup is empty 
And I haven't got a penny 
For to buy no more whiskey 
I have to go home 
 
I counted up my blessings 
And counted only one 
One tiny little blessing 
And now that blessings gone 
So buy me one more drink, my brother 
Then I'm taking to the road 
Yes, I'm taking to the rain 
I'm taking to the snow 
O my friend, my only brother 
Do not let the party grieve 
So throw a dollar onto the bar 
Now kiss my ass and leave 
 
O brother, my cup is empty 
And I haven't got a penny 
For to buy no more whiskey 
I have to go home

BY THE TIME I GET TO PHOENIX

 By the time I get to Phoenix, she'll be rising 
And she'll find that note that I left hanging on the door 
And she'll laugh when she reads the part 
That says: I'm leaving 
Cause I've left that girl so many times before 
 
And by the time I get to Albuquerque, she'll be working 
And she'll take off time just to give me a call 
And she'll hear that phone keep right on ringing and ringing 
On the wall, yeah oh, that's all 
 
And by the time I make Oklahoma, she'll be sleeping 
She'll turn softly in her sleep and call my name out low 
And then she'll cry just to think that I'd really leave her, I left her 
But time after time after time I tried to tell her so 
But she just didn't know That I would really go 
That I would really go

 


CABIN FEVER!

 The Captain's fore arm like bunched up rope 
with A N I T A wrigglin' free on a skull'n'dagger 
and a portrait of Christ, nailed to an anchor 
etched into his upper... 
O o o' Cabin Fever! 
O o o' Cabin Fever! 
Slams his fucken tin dish down 
Our Captain, takes time to crush 
Some Bloo Bottles glowin in his gruel 
with a lump in his throat, and lumpy mush 
Thumbing a scrapbook stuck up with clag 
and a morbid lump of Love in his flags. 
Done is the Missing, now all that remain 
Is to sail forever, upon the stain 
Cabin Fever! O o o' Cabin Fever! 
 
The captain's free hand is a cleaver 
which he fashions his beard, n' he rations his jerkey! 
and carves his peg outa the finest mahagony! 
Or was it Ebony? etc... 
 
Tallies up his loneliness, notch by notch 
For the sea offers nuthin to hold or touch 
Notch by notch, winter by winter 
Notch x notch, winter x winter 
 
Now his leg is whittled, right down to a splinter 
O o Cabin Fever! O o o Cabin Fever! 
O the rollin sea still rollin on! 
She's everywhere! now that she's gone! Gone! Gone! 
O Cabin Fever! O Cabin Fever! 
 
Welcome to his table, Beloved Unconscious 
Raisin her host of hair from her crooks 
and strugglin to summony one of her looks! 
His arm now like coiled s s s snakes 
Whips all the bottles that he's drunken, 
like crystal skittles about the cabin, 
of a ship they'd been sailing 
 
Five years sunken... etc...

 


CHRISTINA THE ASTONISHING

 Christina the Astonishing 
Lived a long time ago 
She was stricken with a seizure 
At the age of twenty two 
They took her body in a coffin 
To a tiny church in Liege 
Where she sprang up from the coffin 
Just after the Agnus Dei 
She soared up to the rafters 
Perched on a beam up there 
Cried The stink of human sin 
Is more that I can bear 
Christina the Astonishing 
Was the most astonishing of all 
She prayed balanced on a hurdle 
Or curled up into a ball 
She fled to remote places 
Climbed towers and trees and walls 
To escape the stench of human corruption 
Into an oven she did crawl 
O Christina the Astonishing 
Behaved in a terrifying way 
She would run wildly through the streets 
Jump in the Meusse and swim away 
O Christina the Astonishing 
Behaved in terrifying manner 
Died at the age of seventy four 
In the convent of St Anna

 


CITY OF REFUGE

 You better run You better run and run and run 
You better run You better run 
You better run to the City of Refuge 
You better run You better run 
You better run to the City of Refuge 
 
You stand before your maker 
In a state of shame 
Bacause your robes are covered in mud 
While your kneel at the feet 
Of a woman of the street 
The gutters will run with blood 
They will run with blood! 
 
You better run, you better run 
You better run to the City of Refuge 
You better run, you better run 
You better run to the City of Refuge 
 
In the days of madness 
My brother, my sister 
When you're dragged toward the Hell mouth 
You will beg at the end 
But there ain't gonna be one, friend 
For the grave will spew you out 
It will spew you out! 
 
You better run, you better run 
You better run to the City of Refuge 
You better run, you better run 
You better run to the City of Refuge 
 
You'll be working in the darkness 
Against your fellow man 
And you'll find you're called to come forth 
So you'll scrub and you'll scrub 
But the trouble is, bud 
The blood it won't wash off 
No, it won't come off! 
 
You better run, you better run 
You better run to the City of Refuge 
You better run, you better run 
You better run and run and run 
You better run to the City of Refuge

 


CROW JANE

 Crow Jane Crow Jane 
Crow Jane 
Horrors in her head 
That her tongue dare not name 
She lives alone by the river 
The rolling rivers of pain 
Crow Jane Crow Jane 
Crow Jane Ah hah huh 
There is one shining eye on a hard hat 
The company closed down the mine 
Winking on waters they came 
Twenty hard hats, twenty eyes 
In her clapboard shack 
Only six foot by five 
They killed all her whiskey 
And poured their pistols dry 
Crow Jane Crow Jane 
Crow Jane Ah hah huh 
Seems you've remembered 
How to sleep, how to sleep 
The house dogs are in your turnips 
And your yard dogs are running all over the street 
Crow Jane Crow Jane 
Crow Jane Ah hah huh 
 O Mr. Smith and Mr. Wesson 
Why you close up shop so late? 
 Just fitted out a girl who looked like a bird 
Measured .32, .44, .38 
I asked that girl which road she was taking 
Said she was walking the road of hate 
But she stopped on a coal trolley up to New Haven 
Population: 48 
Crow Jane Crow Jane 
Crow Jane Ah hah huh 
Your guns are drunk and smoking 
They've followed you right back to your gate 
Laughing all the way back from the new town 
Population, now, 28 
Crow Jane Crow Jane 
Crow Jane Ah hah huh

 


DARKER WITH THE DAY

 As so with that, I thought I'd take a final walk 
The tide of public opinion had started to abate 
The neighbours, bless them, had 
turned out to be all talk 
I could see their frightened faces 
peering at me trough the gate 
 
I was looking for an end to this, for some kind of closure 
Time moved so rapidly, I had no hope 
of keeping track of it 
I thought of my friends who had died of exposure 
And I remembered other ones who 
had died from the lack of it 
 
And in my best shoes I started falling 
forward down the street 
I stopped at a church and jostled trough the crowd 
And love followed just behind me 
panting at my feet 
At the steeple tore the stomach from a lonely little cloud 
 
Inside I sat, seeking the presence of a God 
I searched trough the pictures in a 
leather bound book 
I found a woolly lamb dozing in an issue of blood 
And a gilled Jesus shivering on a 
fisherman's hook 
 
Babe 
It seems so long 
Since you've been gone away 
And I 
Just got to say 
That it grows darker with the day 
 
Back on the street I saw a great big smiling sun 
It was a Good day and an Evil day and 
all was bright and new 
And it seemed to me that most 
destruction was beeing done 
By those who could not choose 
between the two 
 
Amateurs, dilettantes, hacks, cowboya, clones 
The streets groan with little Caesars, 
Napoleons and cunts 
With their building blocks and their tiny 
plastic phones 
Counting on their fingers, with crumbs 
down their fronts 
 
I passed by your garden, saw you with your flowers 
The Mangolias, Camellias and Azaleas so sweet 
And I stood there invisible in the panicking crowds 
You looked so beatiful in the rising heat 
 
I smell smoke, see little fires bursting on the lawns 
People carry on regardless, listening to their hands 
Great cracks appear in the pavement, 
the earth yawns 
Bored and disgusted, to do us down 
 
Babe 
It seems so long 
Since you've been gone 
And I 
Just got to say 
That it grows darker with the day 
 
These streets are frozen now 
I come and go 
Full of a longing for something I do 
not know 
My father sits slumped in the 
deepening snow 
As I search, in and out, above, 
about, below 
 
Babe 
It seems so long 
Since you went away 
And I 
Just got to say 
That it grows darker with the day

 


DEAD MAN IN MY BED

 She sat in a wicker chair, her eyes they were downcast 
She breathed in the future, by breathing out the past 
The die is done, the die is shook, the die is duly cast 
There is a dead man in my bed, she said 
That smile you see upon his face 
It s been there for many days 
There s a dead man in my bed 
 
I ain t been feeling that good too much no more, she said, I swear 
She pointed at the bedroom door and said I ain t going in there 
She leaped out of her seat and screamed someone s not concentrating here 
There is a dead man in my bed, she said 
I ain t speaking metaphorically 
His eyes are open but he cannot see 
There s a dead man in my bed 
 
The leaves outside the window waved, all brown, they were, and falling 
Even I could tell the atmosphere in here was utterly appalling 
The phone it rang incessantly but nobody was calling 
There s a dead man in my bed, she said 
And though he keeps on taking notes 
I swear this ain t some kind of hoax 
Dead man in my bed 
 
Now she s in the kitchen, rattling those pots and pans 
I d cook him something nice, she said, but he refuses to wash his hands 
He used to be so good to me, now he smells so fucking bad 
There is a dead man in my bed, she said 
I keep poking at him with my stick 
But his skin is just so fucking thick 
There s a dead man in my bed 
 
We ve gotta get it all together 
We ve gotta get it all together 
We ve gotta get it all together 
We ve gotta get it all together

DEATH IS NOT THE END

 When you're sad and when you're lonely 
And you haven't got a friend 
Just remember that death is not the end 
And all that you held sacred 
Falls down and does not mend 
Just remember that death is not the end 
Not the end, not the end 
Just remember that death is not the end 
When you're standing on the crossroads 
That you cannot comprehend 
Just remember that death is not the end 
And all your dreams have vanished 
And you don't know what's up the bend 
Just remember that death is not the end 
Not the end, not the end 
Just remember that death is not the end 
When the storm clouds gather round you 
And heavy rains descend 
Just remember that death is not the end 
And there's no one there to comfort you 
With a helping hand to lend 
Just remember that death is not the end 
Not the end, not the end 
Just remember that death is not the end 
For the tree of life is growing 
Where the spirit never dies 
And the bright light of salvation 
Up in dark and empty skies 
When the cities are on fire 
With the burning flesh of men 
Just remember that death is not the end 
When you search in vain to find 
Some law abiding citizen 
Just remember that death is not the end 
Not the end, not the end 
Just remember that death is not the end 
Not the end, not the end 
Just remember that death is not the end

 


FAR FROM ME

 For you dear, I was born 
For you I was raised up 
For you I've lived and for you I will die 
For you I am dying now 
You were my mad little lover 
In a world where everybody fucks everybody else over 
You who are so far from me 
Far from me 
So far from me 
Way across some cold neurotic sea 
Far from me 
 
I would talk to you of all matter of things 
With a smile you would reply 
Then the sun would leave your pretty face 
And you'd retreat from the front of your eyes 
I keep hearing that you're doing best 
I hope your heart beats happy in your infant breast 
You are so far from me 
Far from me 
Far from me 
 
There is no knowledge but i know it 
There's nothing to learn from that vacant voice 
That sails to me across the line 
From the ridiculous to the sublime 
It's good to hear you're doing so well 
But really can't you find somebody else that you can ring and tell 
Did you ever 
Care for me? 
Were you ever 
There for me? 
So far from me 
 
You told me you'd stick by me 
Through the thick and through the thin 
Those were your very words 
My fair weather friend 
You were my brave hearted lover 
At the first taste of trouble went running back to mother 
So far from me 
Far from me 
Suspended in your bleak and fishless sea 
Far from me 
Far from me

 


FIFTEEN FEET OF PURE WHITE SNOW

 Where is Mona? 
She's long gone 
Where is Mary? 
She's taken her along 
But they haven't put their mittens on 
And there's fifteen feet of pure white snow? 
 
Where is Michael? 
Where is Mark? 
Where is Mathew 
Now it's getting dark? 
Where is John? They are all out back 
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow 
Would you please put down that telephone 
We're under fifteen feet of pure white snow 
 
I waved to my neighbour 
My neighbour waved to me 
But my neighbour 
Is my enemy 
I kept waving my arms 
Till I could not see 
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow 
 
Is anybody 
Out there please? 
It's too quiet in here 
And I'm beginning to freeze 
I've got icicles hanging 
From my knees 
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow 
 
Is there anybody here who feels this low? 
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow 
 
Raise your hands up to the sky 
Raise your hands up to the sky 
Raise your hands up to the sky 
Is it any wonder? 
Oh my Lord Oh my Lord 
Oh my Lord Oh my Lord 
 
Doctor, Doctor 
I'm going mad 
This is the worst day 
I've ever had 
I can't remember 
Ever feeling this bad 
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow 
Where's my nurse 
I need some healing 
I've been paralysed 
By a lack of feeling 
I can't even find 
Anything worth stealing 
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow 
 
Is there anyone else here who doesn't know? 
We're under fifteen feet of pure white snow 
 
Raise your hands up to the sky 
Raise your hands up to the sky 
Raise your hands up to the sky 
Is it any wonder? 
Oh my Lord Oh my Lord 
Oh my Lord Oh my Lord 
Save Yourself! Help Yourself! 
Save Yourself! Help Yourself! 
Save Yourself! Help Yourself! 
Save Yourself! Help Yourself!

 


FOI NA CRUZ

 Foi na cruz, foi na cruz 
Que um dia 
Meus pecados castigados em Jesus 
Foi na cruz 
Que um dia 
Foi na cruz 
 
Love comes a knocking 
Comes a knocking upon our door 
But you, you and me, love 
We don't live here any more 
 
Foi na cruz, foi na cruz 
Que um dia 
Meus pecados castigados em Jesus 
Foi na cruz 
Que um dia 
Foi na cruz 
 
A little sleep, a little slumber 
A little folding of the hands to sleep 
A little love, a little hate, babe 
A little trickery and deceit 
 
Foi na cruz, foi na cruz 
Que um dia 
Meus pecados castigados em Jesus 
Foi na cruz 
Que um dia 
Foi na cruz 
 
Dream on 'till you can dream no more 
For all our grand plans, babe 
Will be dreams forever more 
 
Foi na cruz, foi na cruz 
Que um dia 
Meus pecados castigados em Jesus 
Foi na cruz 
Que um dia 
Foi na cruz

FROM HER TO ETERNITY

 Ah wanna tell ya 'bout a girl 
You know, she lives in room 29 
Why... Why... that's the one right up top a mine 
Ah start to cry, Ah start to cry 
 
O Ah hear her walkin' 
Walkin' barefoot cross the floor boards 
All thru this lonesome night 
Ah hear her crying too. 
Hot tears come splashin on down 
Leaking thru the cracks, 
Down upon my face, Ah catch'em in my mouth! 
Ah catch'em in my mouth! 
Ah catch'em in my mouth! 
Walk'n'cry Walk'n'cry y!!! 
 
From her to eternity! 
From her to eternity! 
From her to eternity! 
 
Ah read her diary on her sheets 
Scrutinizin' every lil bit of dirt 
Tore out a page'n'stufft it inside my shirt 
Fled outa the window, 
And shinning it down the vine 
Outa her night mare, and back into mine 
Mine! O Mine! 
 
From her to eternity! 
From her to eternity! 
From her to eternity! 
Cry! Cry! CRY! 
 
She's wearing them bloo stockens, ah bet! 
and standin' like this with my ear to the ceiling 
Listen, Ah know it must sound absurd 
but Ah can hear the most melancholy sound 
Ah ever heard! 
Walk'n'cry! Kneel'n'cry y! 
 
From her to eternity! 
From her to eternity! 
 
O tell me why? O tell me why? 
Oh Why? Why? Why? 
O tell me why and don't tell me a lie! 
Why the ceiling still shakes? Shakes! Shakes! Shakes! 
Why the fixtures turn to serpents and snakes? 
 
This desire to possess her is a wound 
and its naggin at me like a shrew 
but, Ah know, that to possess her 
Is, therefore, not to desire her. 
 
O o o then ya know, that lil girl would just have to go! 
Go! Go o o! From her to eternity! 
 
From her to eternity! [Repeat]

GATES TO THE GARDEN

 Past the ivy covered windows of The Angel 
Down Athenaeum Lane to the cathedral 
Trough the churchyard I wandered 
Sat for a spell there and I pondered 
My back to the gates of the garden 
My back to the gates of the garden 
My back to the gates of the garden 
 
Fugitive fathers, sickly infants, decent mothers 
Runaways and suicidal lovers 
Assorted boxes of ordinary bones 
Of aborted plans and sudden shattered hopes 
In unlucky rows, up to the gates of the garden 
In unhappy rows, up to the gates of the garden 
In unlucky rows, up to the gates of the garden 
 
Won't you meet me at the gates 
Won't you meet me at the gates 
Won't you meet me at the gates 
To the garden 
 
Beneath the creeping shadow of the tower 
The bell from St.Edmunds informs me of the hour 
I turn to find you waiting there for me 
In sunlight and I see the way that you breathe 
Alive and leaning on the gates of the garden 
Alive and leaning on the gates of the garden 
Alive and leaning on the gates of the garden 
 
Leave these ancient places to the angels 
Let the saints attend to their keeping of the cathedrals 
And leave the dead beneath the ground so cold 
For God is in this hand that I hold 
As we open up the gates of the garden 
 
Won't you meet me at the gates 
Won't you meet me at the gates 
Won't you meet me at the gates 
To the garden

 


GOD IS IN THE HOUSE

 We've laid the cables and the wires 
We've split the wood and stoked 
the fires 
We've lit our town so there is no 
Place for crime to hide 
Our little church is painted white 
And in the safety of the night 
We all go quiet as a mouse 
For the word is out 
God is in the house 
God is in the house 
God is in the house 
No cause for worry now 
God is in the house 
 
Moral sneaks in the White House 
Computer geeks in the school house 
Drug freaks in the crack house 
We don't have that stuff here 
We have a tiny little Force 
But we need them of course 
For the kittens in the trees 
And at night we are on our knees 
As quiet as a mouse 
For God is in the house 
God is in the house 
God is in the house 
And no one's left in doubt 
God is in the house 
 
Homos roaming the streets in packs 
Queer bashers with tyre jacks 
Lesbian counter attacks 
That stuff is for the big cities 
Our town is very pretty 
We have a pretty little square 
We have a woman for a mayor 
Our policy is firm but fair 
Now that God is in the house 
God is in the house 
God is in the house 
Any day now He'll come out 
God is in the house 
 
Well meaning little therapists 
Goose stepping twelve stepping Tetotalitarianists 
The tipsy, the reeling and the drop down pissed 
We got no time for that stuff here 
Zero crime and no fear 
We've bred all our kittens white 
So you can see them in the night 
And at night we're on our knees 
As quiet as a mouse 
Since the word got out 
From the North down to the South 
For no one's left in doubt 
There's no fear about 
If we all hold hands and very quietly shout 
Hallelujah 
God is in the house 
God is in the house 
Oh I wish He would come out 
God is in the house

 


GREEN EYES

 Kiss me again, rekiss me and kiss me 
Slip your frigid hands beneath my shirt 
This useless old fucker with his twinkling cunt 
Doesn't care if he gets hurt 
 
Green eyes, Green eyes 
Green eyes, Green eyes 
 
If it were but a matter of faith 
If it were measured in petitions and prayer 
She would materialise, all fleshed out 
But it is not, nor do I care 
 
Green eyes, Green eyes 
Green eyes, Green eyes 
 
So hold me and hold me, don't tell me your name 
This morning will be wiser than this evening is 
Then leave me to my enemied dreams 
And be quiet as you are leaving, Miss 
 
Green eyes... 
Green eyes, Green eyes 
Green eyes, Green eyes 
Green eyes, Green eyes

 


GRIEF CAME RIDING

 A grief came riding 
On the wind 
Up the sun on river Thames 
I was sittin' on the bank with my mouth open 
When I felt it entering 
 
I began thinkin' about our wedding day 
And how love was a vow 
I was thinkin' about the chamber door 
Only we can enter now 
 
I began thinkin' about our ancient friends 
And of kissin them goodbye 
And then the wind blew under Battersea bridge 
And a tear broke from my eye 
 
I started thinkin' about London 
And nothing good ever came from this town 
and if the Thames weren t so filthy 
I would jump in the river and drown 
 
Don't be afraid 
Come on down 
I'm just sittin' here 
And thinking of love 
 
A grief came riding 
On the wind 
Up the river where the bridges crouch 
Blowin people back and fall 
From the marital bed to the psychiatric couch 
 
Blowin' people far apart 
Blowin' others so they collide 
Blowin some poor bastard right out of the water 
blowin another one over the side 
 
Hear the ancient iron bridge 
And listen to it groan 
with the weight of a thousand people 
Leavin' or returning home 
 
To their failures 
To their bordoms 
To their husbands 
And their wife s 
who are carving them up for dinner 
before they even arrive 
 
Don't be afraid 
Come on down 
I'm just sittin' here 
And thinkin' of love 
 
And look they just blow the water 
See the saviour of the human race 
Where the fishes and the frogs 
Has found his final resting place 
 
Don't be afraid 
Come on down 
I'm just sittin' here 
Thinkin' of love

 


HALLEJUJAH

 On the first day of May I took to the road 
I'd been staring out the window most of the morning 
I'd watched the rain claw at the glass 
And a vicious wind blew hard and fast 
I should have taken it as a warning 
As a warning As a warning 
As a warning 
 
I'd given my nurse the weekend off 
My meals were ill prepared 
My typewriter had turned mute as a tomb 
And my piano crouched in the corner of my room 
With all its teeth bared 
All its teeth bared All its teeth bared 
All its teeth bared. 
 
Hallelujah Hallelujah 
Hallelujah Hallelujah 
 
I left my house without my coat 
Something my nurse would not have allowed 
And I took the small roads out of town 
And I passed a cow and the cow was brown 
And my pyjamas clung to me like a shroud 
Like a shroud Like a shroud 
Like a shroud 
 
There rose before me a little house 
With all hope and dreams kept within 
A woman's voice close to my ear 
Said, Why don't you come in here? 
 You looked soaked to the skin 
Soaked to the skin Soaked to the skin 
Soaked to the skin 
 
Hallelujah Hallelujah 
Hallelujah Hallelujah 
 
I turned to the woman and the woman was young 
I extended a hearty salutation 
But I knew if my nurse had been here 
She would never in a thousand years 
Permit me to accept that invitation 
Invitation That invitation 
That invitation 
 
Now, you might think it wise to risk it all 
Throw caution to the reckless wind 
But with her hot cocoa and her medication 
My nurse had been my one salvation 
So I turned back home 
I turned back home I turned back home 
Singing my song 
 
Hallelujah 
The tears are welling in my eyes again 
Hallelujah 
I need twenty big buckets to catch them in 
Hallelujah 
And twenty pretty girls to carry 
them down 
Hallelujah 
And twenty deep holes to bury them in 
Hallelujah 
The tears are welling in my eyes again 
Hallelujah 
I need twenty big buckets to catch them in 
Hallelujah 
And twenty pretty girls to carry them down 
Hallelujah 
And twenty deep holes to bury them in

 


HARD ON FOR LOVE

 It is for she that the cherry bleeds 
That the moon is steeped in mild nad blood 
That I steal like a robber 
From her altar of love 
O money lender! O clover gender! 
I am the fiend hid in her skirts 
And it's as hot as hell in here 
Coming at her as I am from above 
Hard on for love hard on for love 
Hard on for love hard on for love 
 
Well, I swear I seen that girl before 
Like she walked straight outa the book of Leveticus 
But they can stone me with stones I don't care 
 
Just as long as I can get to kiss 
Those gypsy lips! Gypsy lips! 
My aim is to hit this Miss 
And I'm moving in (I'm moving in) 
Coming at her like Lazarus from above 
Hard on for love hard on for love 
Hard on for love hard on for love 
 
The Lord is my shepard I shall not want 
The Lord is my shepard I shall not want 
But he ledeth me like a lamb to the lips 
Of the mouth of the valley of the whadow of death 
I am his rod and his staff 
I am his sceptre and shaft 
And she is heaven and hell 
At whose gates I ain't been delivered 
I'm gunna give the gates a shove 
Hard on for love hard on for love 
Hard on for love hard on for love 
 
And her breasts rise and fall 
Breast rise and fall 
Breast rise and fall 
Breast rise and fall 
And just when I'm about to get my hands on her 
Just when I'm about to get my hands on her 
Just when I'm about to get my hands on her 
Just when I'm about to get my hands on her 
You are beautiful! O dove! 
Hard on for love hard on for love 
Hard on for love hard on for love 
 
Just when I'm about to get my hands on her 
Just when I'm about to get my hands on her 
 
Her breasts rise and fall 
Her breasts rise and fall 
 
Just when I'm about to get my hands on her 
Just when I'm about to get my hands on her 
 
Hard on for love hard on for love 
Hard on for love hard on for love

 


HE WANT S YOU

 In his boat and through the dark he rowed 
Chained to oar and the night and the wind that blowed 
Horribly ?round his ears 
Under the bridge and into your dreams he soars 
While you lie alone in that idea free sleep of yours 
That you ve been sleeping now for years 
 
And he wants you 
He wants you 
He is straight and he is true 
Ooh hoo hoo 
 
Beneath the hanging cliffs and under the many stars where 
He will move, all amongst your tangled hair 
And deep into the sea 
And you will wake and walk and draw the blind 
And feel some presence there behind 
And turn to see what that may be 
Oh, babe, it s me 
 
And he wants you 
He wants you 
He is straight and he is true 
Ooh hoo hoo

 


HENRY LEE

 Get down, get down, little Henry Lee

You won't find a girl in this damn world 
That will compare with me 
And the wind did howl and the wind did blow

Just for a kiss or two 
And with a little pen knife held in her hand 
She plugged him through and through 
And the wind did roar and the wind did moan 
La la la la la 
La la la la lee 
A little bird lit down on Henry Lee 
Come take him by his lilly white hands 
Come take him by his feet 
And throw him in this deep deep well 
Which is more than one hundred feet 
And the wind did howl and the wind did blow 
La la la la la

Lie there, lie there, little Henry Lee 
Till the flesh drops from your bones 
For the girl you have in that merry green land 
Can wait forever for you to come home

I DO LOVE HER SO (LIME TREE ARBOUR)

 The boatman calls from the lake 
A lone loon dives upon the water 
I put my hand over her 
Down in the lime tree arbour 
 
The wind in the trees is whispering 
Whispering low that I love her 
She puts her hand over mine 
Down in the lime tree arbour 
 
Through every breath that I breathe 
And every place I go 
There is hand that protects me 
And I do love her so 
 
There will always be suffering 
It flows through life like water 
I put my hand over hers 
Down in the lime tree arbour 
 
The boatman he has gone 
And the loons have flown for cover 
She puts her hand over mine 
Down in the lime tree arbour 
 
Through every word that I speak 
And every thing I know 
There is hand that protects me 
And I do love her so

I HAD A DREAM, JOE

 I had a dream 
I had a dream 
I had a dream, Joe 
 
I had a dream, Joe 
You were standing in the middle of an open road 
I had a dream, Joe 
Your hands were raised up to the sky 
And your mouth was covered in foam 
I had a dream, Joe 
A shadowy Jesus flitted from tree to tree 
I had a dream, Joe 
And a society of whores stuck needles in an image of me 
I had a dream, Joe 
It was Autumn time and thickly fell the leaves 
And in that dream, Joe 
A pimp in seersucker suit sucked a toothpick 
And pointed his finger at me 
 
I had a dream, 
I had a dream, 
I had a dream, Joe 
 
I opened my eyes, Joe 
The night had been a giant, dribbling and pacing the boards 
I opened my eyes, Joe 
All your letters and cards stacked up against the door 
I opened my eyes, Joe 
The morning light came slowly tumbling through the crack 
In the window, Joe 
And I thought of you and I felt like I was lugging 
A body on my back 
 
I had a dream, 
I had a dream, 
I had a dream, Joe 
 
Where did you go, Joe? 
On that endless, senseless, demented drift 
Where did you go, Joe? 
Into the woods, into the trees, where you move and shift 
Where did you go, Joe? 
All dressed up in your ridiculous seersucker suit 
Where did you go, Joe? 
With that strew of wreckage 
Forever at the heel of your boot 
 
I had a dream 
I had a dream 
I had a dream, Joe 
I had a dream 
I had a dream 
I had a dream, Joe

 


I LET LOVE IN

 Despair and Deception, Love's ugly little twins 
Came a knocking on my door, I let them in 
Darling, you're the punishment for all of my former sins 
 
I let love in 
I let love in 
 
The door it opened just a crack, but Love was shrewed and bold 
My life flashed before my eyes, it was a horror to behold 
A life sentence sweeping confetti from the floor of a concrete hole 
 
I let love in 
I let love in 
I let love in 
I let love in 
 
Well I've been bound and gagged and I've been terrorized 
And I've been castrated and I've been lobotomized 
But never has my tormenter come in such a cunning disguise 
 
I let love in 
I let love in 
I let love in 
I let love in 
 
O Lord, tell me what I done 
Please don't leave me here alone 
Where are my friends? 
My friends are gone 
 
O Lord, tell me what I done 
Please don't leave me here alone 
Where are my friends? 
My friends are gone 
 
I let love in 
I let love in 
 
So if you're sitting all alone and hear a knocking at you door 
and the air is full of promises, well buddy, you've been warned 
Far worse to be Love's lover than the lover that Love has scorned 
 
I let love in 
I let love in 
I let love in 
I let love in 
I let love in 
I let love in 
I let love in 
I let love in

I'M GONNA KILL THAT WOMAN

 Yeah, my baby left me this morning 
And I don't care now, I don't care what the people say 
 
Yeah, I did everything that I could, everything I could, 
Lord knows I did everything I could 
I tried to satisfy her worried mind, that's what I did 
 
You know she was nothing but trouble, trouble 
She keep me worried all the time 
God knows her movements are killing me 
 
Yeah, my baby stayed out all night long, all night long 
She keep me worried all the time 
 
Yeah, I lay down last night I was thinking 
Must I kill that woman? Must I kill that woman? 
Oh Lord I get down on my knees 
They tell me God forgivin' everything you do 
But I don't care what the people say 
I'm gonna kill that woman, 
I'm gonna kill that woman, God knows 
I'm gonna get down on my knees

 


IDIOT PRAYER

 They're taking me down, my friend 
And as they uskher me off to my end 
Will I bid you adieu? 
Or will I be seeing you soon? 
If what they say around here is true 
Then we'll meet again 
Me and you 
 
My time is at hand, my dove 
They're gunna pass me to that house above 
Is Heaven just for victims, dear? 
Where only those in pain go? 
Well it takes two to tango 
We will meet again, my love 
I know 
 
If you're in Heaven then you'll forgive me, dear 
Because that's what they do up there 
If you're in Hell, then what can I say 
You probably deserved in anyway 
I guess I'm gunna find out any day 
For we'll meet again 
And there'll be Hell to pay 
 
Your face comes to me from the depths, dear 
Your silent mouth mouths, 'Yes , dear 
Dark red and big with blood 
They're gunna shut me down, my love 
They're gunna launch me into the stars 
Well, all things come to pass 
Glory hallelujah 
 
This prayer is for you, my love 
Sent on the wings of a dove 
An idiot prayer of empty words 
Love, dear, is strictly for the birds 
We each get what we deserve 
My little snow white dove 
Rest assured

 


IN THE GHETTO

 As the snow flies 
On a cold and grey Chicago morn 
A poor little baby child is born in the ghetto 
 
And his mama cries 
Cause there's one thing that she don't need 
Is another little hungry mouth to feed in the ghetto 
 
Oh people don't you understand 
This child needs a helping hand 
He's gonna grow to be an angry young man some day 
Take a look at you and me 
Are we that blind to see? 
Do we simply turn our heads and look the other way? 
 
And the world turns 
And the hungry little boy with the runny nose 
Plays in the streets as the cold wind blows in the ghetto 
And his hunger burns 
So he starts to roam the streets at night 
And he learns how to steal and he learns how to fight in the ghetto 
 
Then one night in desperation 
The young man breaks away 
He buys a gun and steals a car 
He tries to run but he don't get far 
And his mama cries 
A crowd gathers round an angry young man 
Face down in the street with a gun in his hand in the ghetto 
 
Oh people don't you understand 
This child needs a helping hand 
He's gonna grow to be an angry young man some day 
Take a look at you and me 
Are we that blind to see? 
Do we simply turn our heads and look the other way? 
 
And as her young man dies 
On a cold and grey Chicago morn 
Another little baby child is born in the ghetto

 


INTO MY ARMS

 I don't believe in an interventionist God 
But I know, darling, that you do 
But if I did I would kneel down and ask Him 
Not to intervene when it came to you 
Not to touch a hair on your head 
To leave you as you are 
And if He felt He had to direct you 
Then direct you into my arms 
 
Into my arms, O Lord 
Into my arms, O Lord 
Into my arms, O Lord 
Into my arms 
 
And I don't believe in the existence of angels 
But looking at you I wonder if that's true 
But if I did I would summon them together 
And ask them to watch over you 
To each burn a candle for you 
To make bright and clear your path 
And to walk, like Christ, in grace and love 
And guide you into my arms 
 
Into my arms, O Lord 
Into my arms, O Lord 
Into my arms, O Lord 
Into my arms 
 
And I believe in Love 
And I know that you do too 
And I believe in some kind of path 
That we can walk down, me and you 
So keep your candlew burning 
And make her journey bright and pure 
That she will keep returning 
Always and evermore 
 
Into my arms, O Lord 
Into my arms, O Lord 
Into my arms, O Lord 
Into my arms

JACK'S SHADOW

 They dragged Jack and his shadow 
From the hole 
And the bulb that burned above him 
Did shine both day and night 
And his shadow learned to love his 
Little darks and greater light 
And the sun it shined 
And the sun it shined 
And the sun it shined 
A little longer 
 
Jack wept and kissed his shadow 
 Goodbye 
Spat from their dirty dungeons 
Into a truly different din 
Shat from their institutions 
Into a fully different din 
And his shadow soon became a wife 
And children plagued his latter life 
Until one night he took a skinning knife 
And stole into the town 
And tracked his shadow down 
 
Said the shadow to Jack Henry 
 What's wrong? 
Jack said A home is not a hole 
 And shwdow, you're just a gallow that I hang my body from 
 O Shadow, your a shackle from wich my time is never done 
Then he peeled his shadow off in strips 
He peeled his shadow off in strips 
Then kneeled his shadow on some steps 
And cried What have I done? 
 
And the sun it shined 
And the sun it shined 
I say Love is blind 
 And is it any wonder?! 
 And is it any wonder?! 
 
Jacked and his damned shadow 
Is gone 
And though each one of us are want to duly mourn 
And though each one of us are want to duly mourn 
'Tis done in brighter corners now 
'Tis done in brighter corners now 
Now that Jack's black shadow's gone 
 
And the sun it shined 
And the sun it shined 
 
And the sun it shined 
A little stronger 
 
I swear, love is blind 
Ooh, love is blind 
Yeah, love is blind 
And is it any wonder? 
 
'Tis done in brighter corners now 
'Tis done in brighter corners now 
Now that Jack's black shadow's gone 
 
Etcetera Etcetera

 


JANGLING JACK

 Jangling Jack 
Goes Yackety Yack 
Visits the home of the brave 
Hails a fat yellow cab 
Jack wanna celebrate 
Jack wanna big drink 
Driver drops him at a bar 
Called the Rinky Dink 
Jack pushes through the door 
And crosses the floor 
Tips his hat to a man 
Grinning in the corner 
Going Do da do Do da do 
 
Says, I'm Jangling Jack 
I go Do da do 
I wanna Rinky Dink Special 
I wanna little umbrella too 
Jack flops on his stool 
Sees the grinning man laugh 
So Jack laughs back 
Jack raises his glass 
Says, God bless this country 
And everything in it 
The losers and the winners 
The good guys and the sinners 
The grinning man says, Buddy 
It's all Yackety Yack 
Whips out a little black pistol 
Shoots a bullet in Jack 
 
Jangling Jack Do Da Do Do Da Do 
Jangling Jack 
How do you Do Da Do 
 
Jangling Jack Flies off his seat 
Crashes through the door 
Lands in a heap on the street 
Hears his mother's voice 
Going, Do do do 
Jack is shouting 
Mummy is that you? 
He sees the berserk city 
Sees the dead stacked in piles 
Sees the screaming crowd 
Screams, Where am I? 
Going Do da do Going Do da do 
 
Well Jangling Jack 
As a matter of fact 
Crawls through the crowd 
Back into the bar 
Jack crawls to his stool 
Jack drags himself up 
Falls back down on his arse 
In a puddle of blood 
Going Goodbye Mummy 
Goodbye Goodbye 
Jack doubles over 
And he vomits and dies 
Going Do do do Going Do do do

 


JESUS MET THE WOMAN AT THE WELL

 Jesus met the woman at the well 
Jesus met the woman at the well 
And he told her, everything that she'd done, that she'd done 
 
And he said, woman, look a here woman, 
Tell me where is your husband? 
She said whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, I don't have one 
 
He said, woman, look a here woman, 
They tell me you have five husbands 
And that man you have now sure ain't one 
 
She went running, crying, God help me 
She said whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you must be the prophet 
Because you told me everything that I've done

 


JOHN FINN'S WIFE

 Well the night was deep and the night was dark 
And I was at the old dance hall on the edge of town 
Some big ceremony was going down 
Dancers writhed and squirmed and then, 
Came apart and then writhed again 
Like squirming flies on a pin 
In the heat and in the din 
Yes, in the heat and in the din 
I fell to thinking about brand new wife of mad John Finn 
 
Well, midnite came and clock did strike 
And in she came, did John Finn's wife 
With legs like scissors and butcher's knives 
A tattooed breast and flaming eyes 
And a crimson carnation in her teeth 
Carving her way through the dance floor 
And I'm standing over by the bandstand 
Every eye gaping on John Finn's wife 
Yeah, every eye gaping on John Finn's wife 
 
Now John Finn's wife was something of a mystery 
In a town where to share a sworn secret was a solemn duty 
I had brass knuckles and a bolo knife 
Over near the bandstand with John Finn's wife 
She got perfumed breasts and raven hair 
Sprinkled with wedding confettis 
And a gang of garrotters were all giving me stares 
Armed, as they were, with machetes 
And the night through the window was full of lights 
Winking and awatching at John Finns' wife 
Winking and awatching at John Finns' wife 
 
Next came the cops, all out on the town 
But it don't look like no trouble there 
As they head for the bar in their lumpy suits 
And I slip my hand between the thighs of John Finn's wife 
And they seemed to yawn awake, her things 
It was a warm and very ferocious night 
The moon full of blood and light 
And my eyes grew small and my eyes grew tight 
As I plotted in the ear of John Finns' wife 
 
Enter John Finn in his shrunken suit 
With his quick black eyes and black cheroot 
With his filled down teeth and a hobnail boot 
And his fists full of pistols in his pockets 
Aiming at me and aiming at his wife 
The band fall silent fearing for their lives 
And with fear in my guts like tangled twine 
Cause all I got is brass knuckles and a bolo knife 
And mad John Finns' wife is all 
And the three of us walk out of the hall 
 
Now the night bore down upon us all 
You could hear the crickets in the thickets call 
And guns did flare and guns did bawl 
And I planted my bolo knife in the neck 
Of mad John Finn. I took his wretched life 
Now I'm over near the bandstand 
Every hand moving on John Finns' wife 
Every hand moving on John Finns' wife 
 
And John Finns' wife 
Took all the flowers down 
From her hair 
And threw them on the ground 
And the flies did hum 
And the flies did buzz around 
Poor John Finn 
Lying dead upon the ground 
Lying dead upon the ground

King kong kitchee kitchee ki mi o [4 times and throughout song] 
 
Well frog went a courtin' and he did ride 
With a sword and a pistol by his side And he rode 'til he came to Miss Mouse's door

He said, Little Miss Mouse, will you marry me

With an owl and a bat and a bumblebee?

With an owl and a bat and a bumblebee

LAMENT

 I've seen your fairground hair, 
your seaside eyes 
Your vampire tooth, your little truth 
Your tiny lies 
 
I know your trembling hand, your guilty prize 
Your sleeping limbs, your foreign hymns 
Your midnight cries 
 
So dry your eyes 
And turn your head away 
Now there's nothing more to say 
Now you're gone away 
 
I know your trail of tears, your slip of hand 
Your monkey paw, your monkey claw 
And your monkey hand 
 
I've seen your trick of blood, your trap of fire 
Your ancient wound, your scarlet moon 
And your jailhouse smile 
 
So dry your eyes 
And turn your head away 
Now there's nothing more to say 
Now you're gone away 
 
I'll miss your urchin smile, your orphan tears 
Your shining prize, your tiny cries 
Your little fears 
I'll miss your fairground hair, your seaside eyes 
Your vampire tooth, your little truth 
And your tiny lies 
 
So dry your eyes 
And turn your head away 
Now there's nothing more to say 
Now you're gone away 
(Repeat)

 


LAY ME LOW

 They're gonna lay me low (Lay me low) 
They're gonna sink me in the snow 
They're gonna throw back their heads and crow 
When I go 
 
They're gonna jump and shout (Lay me low) 
They're gonna wave their arms about 
All the stories will come out 
When I go 
 
All the stars will glow bright (Lay me low) 
And my friends will give up the fight 
They'll see my work in a different light 
When I go 
 
They'll try telephoning my mother (Lay me low) 
But they'll end up getting my brother 
Who'll spill the story on some long gone lover 
That I hardly know 
 
Hats off to the man 
On top of the world 
Come crawl up here, baby 
And I'll show you how it works 
If you wanna be my friend 
And you wanna repent 
And you want it all to end 
And you wanna know when 
Well do it now don't care how 
Take your final bow 
Make a stand Take my hand 
And blow it all to hell 
 
They gonna inform the police chief (Lay me low) 
Who'll breathe a sigh of relief 
He'll say I was a malanderer, a badlander, and a thief 
When I go 
 
They will interview my teachers (Lay me low) 
Who'll say I was one of God's sorrier creatures 
There'll print informative six page features 
When I go 
 
They'll bang a big old gong (Lay me low) 
The motorcade will be ten miles long 
The world will join together for a farewell song 
When they put me down below 
 
They'll sound a fluegelhorn (Lay me low) 
And the sea will rage, and the sky will storm 
All man and beast will mourn 
When I go 
 
Hats off to the man 
On top of the world 
Come crawl up here, baby 
And we can watch this damn thing turn 
If you wanna be my friend 
And you wanna repent 
And you want it all to end 
And you wanna know when 
Well do it now Do it now 
Take a long last bow 
Take my hand Make a stand 
And blow it all to hell 
 
Lay me low... 
When I go...

 


LITTLE EMPTY BOAT

 You found me at some party 
You thought I'd understand 
You barreled over to me 
With a drink in each hand 
I respect your beliefs, girl, 
And I consider you a friend, 
But I've already been born once, 
I don't wanna to be born again. 
 
Your knowledge is impressive 
And your argument is good 
But I am the resurrection, babe, 
And you're standing on my foot! 
 
But my little boat is empty 
It don't go 
And my oar is broken 
It don't row, row, row 
But my little boat is empty 
It don't go 
And my oar is broken 
It don't row, row, row 
(Row!) 
 
Your tiny little face 
Keeps yapping in the gloom 
Seven steps behind me 
With your dustpan and broom. 
I couldn't help but imagine you 
All postured and prone 
But there's a little guy on my shoulder 
Says I should go home alone. 
You keep leaning in on me 
And you're looking pretty pissed 
That grave you've dug between your legs 
Is hard to resist. 
 
But my little boat is empty 
It don't go 
And my oar is broken 
It don't row, row, row 
But my little boat is empty 
It don't go 
And my oar is broken 
It don't row, row, row 
 
Give to God what belongs to God 
And give the rest to me 
Tell our gracious host to fuck himself 
It's time for us to leave. 
 
But my little boat is empty 
It don't go 
And my oar is broken 
It don't row, row, row 
But my little boat is empty 
It don't go 
And my oar is broken 
It don't row, row, row 
Row...row...row...row...

 


LONG BLACK VEIL

 She walks these hills in a long black veil 
She visits my grave when the night winds wail 
Nobody knows, nobody sees 
Nobody knows but me 
 
Ten years ago, on a cold dark night 
Someone was killed 'neath the Town Hall light 
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed 
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me 
 
The judge he said: Son, what is your alibi 
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die 
But I spoke not a word though it meant my life 
For I'd been in the arms of my best friends wife 
 
Now the scaffold is high and eternity is near 
She stood in the crowd but shed not a tear 
But sometimes at night when the cold winds moan 
In a long black veil she cries on my bones

 


LONG TIME MAN

 Yeah, they came to take me away 
Said I'd be sitting here for the rest of my life 
But I don't really care I shot my wife 
And brother, I can't even remember the reason why 
 
Oh, it makes a long time man feel bad 
Yeah, it makes a long time man feel bad 
Well I ain't had no love since I don't know when 
It sure makes a long time man feel bad 
 
We was down in Jacksonville 
A cold winter night 
My baby and I, we began to fight 
I heated up, and I grabbed my gun 
I get so cold on those nights down south 
 
She was laying in a pool right there on the kitchen floor 
She looked up at me and began to smile 
Her gasping words: Baby, I love you 
Then she closed those baby blue eyes 
 
(chorus, and variations) 
 
Sometimes I hear you call my name in the dead of the night 
 
I ain't had those arms around me 
I ain't had those lips, those lips, around me 
 
It sure makes a long time man feel bad 
So bad

 


LOVE LETTER

 I hold this letter in my hand 
A plea, a petition, a kind of prayer 
I hope it does as I have planned 
Losing her again is more than I can bear 
I kiss the cold, white envelope 
I press my lips against her name 
Two hundred words. We live in hope 
The sky hangs heavy with rain 
 
Love Letter Love Letter 
Go get her Go get her 
Love Letter Love Letter 
Go tell her Go tell her 
 
A wicked wind whips up the hill 
A handful of hopeful words 
I love her and I always will 
The sky is ready to burst 
Said something I did not mean to say 
Said something I did not mean to say 
Said something I did not mean to say 
It all came out the wrong way 
 
Love Letter Love letter 
Go get her Go get her 
Love Letter Love letter 
Go tell her Go tell her 
 
Rain your kisses down upon me 
Rain your kisses down in storms 
And for all who'll come before me 
In your slowly fading forms 
I'm going out of my mind 
Will leave me standing in 
The rain with a letter and a prayer 
Whispered on the wind 
 
Come back to me 
Come back to me 
O baby please come back to me

 


LOVELY CREATURE

 There she stands, this lovely creature 
There she stands, there she stands 
With her hair full of ribbons 
And green gloves on her hands 
So I asked this lovely creature 
Yes, I asked. Yes I asked 
Would she walk with me a while 
Through this night so fast 
She took my hand, this lovely creature 
 Yes , she said, Yes , she said 
 Yes, I'll walk with you a while 
It was a joyful man she led 
Over hills, this lovely creature 
Over mountains, over ranges 
By great pyramids and sphinxs 
We met drifters and strangers 
Oh the sands, my lovely creature 
And the mad, moaning winds 
At night the deserts writhed 
With diabolical things 
Through the night, through the night 
The wind lashed and it whipped me 
When I got home, my lovely creature 
She was no longer with me 
Somewhere she lies, this lovely creature 
Beneath the slow drifting sands 
With her hair full of ribbons 
And green gloves on her hands

 


LOVERMAN

(How much longer?) 
There's a devil waiting outside your door 
It is bucking and braying and pawing at the floor 
And he's howling with pain and crawling up the walls

With his straining sex in his jumping paw

but look at his eyes 
He wants you, baby, to be his bride 
There's a devil lying by your side 
 
Loverman! Loverman!

 


LUCY

 Last night I lay trembling 
The moon it was low 
It was the end of love 
Of misery and woe 
Then suddenly above me 
Her face buried in light 
Came a vision of beauty 
All covered in white 
Now the bell tower is ringing 
And the night has stole past 
O Lucy, can you hear me? 
Wherever you rest 
I'll love her forever 
I'll love her for all time 
I'll love her till the stars 
Fall down from the sky 
Now the bell tower is ringing 
And I shake on the floor 
O Lucy, can you hear me? 
When I call and call 
Now the bell tower is ringing 
And the moon it is high 
O Lucy, can you hear me 
When I cry and cry and cry

 


MERCY

 I stood in the water 
In the middle month of winter 
My camel skin was torture 
I was in a state of nature 
The wind, sir, it was wicked 
I was so alone 
Just as I predicted 
My followers were gone 
 
And I cried Mercy' 
Have mercy upon me 
And I got down on my knees 
 
Thrown into a dungeon 
Bread and water was my portion 
Faith my only weapon 
To rest the devil's legion 
The speak hole would slide open 
A viper's voice would plead 
Thick with innuendo 
Syphilis and Greed 
 
And she cried Mercy' 
Have mercy upon me 
And I told her to get down on her knees 
 
In a garden full of roses 
My hands, tied behind me 
My cousin was working miracles 
I wondered if he'd find me 
The moon was turned toward me 
Like a platter made of gold 
My death, it almost bored me 
So often was it told 
 
And I cried Mercy' 
I cried mercy on me 
Cryind Mercy' 
Have mercy on me

 


MUDDY WATER

 Mary, grab the baby, the river's rising 
Muddy water taking back the land 
The old frame house, she can't take a one more beating 
Ain't no use to stay and make a stand 
 
Well the morning light shows water in the valley 
Daddy's grave just went below the line 
Things to say, you just can't take em with ya 
This flood will swallow all you've left behind 
 
Won't be back to start all over 
Cause what I felt before is gone 
 
Mary, take the child, the river's rising 
Muddy water taking back my home 
The road is gone, there's just one way to leave here 
Turn my back on what I've left below 
Shifting land, broken farms around me 
Muddy water's changing all I know 
 
It's hard to say just what I'm losing 
Ain't never felt so all alone 
 
Mary, take the child, the river's rising 
Muddy water taking back my home 
 
Won't be back to start all over 
Cause what I felt before is gone 
 
Mary, take the child, the river's rising 
Muddy water's changing all I know 
Muddy water's changing all I know 
Lord, this muddy water is taking back my home

 


NEW MORNING

 One morn I awakened 
A new sun was shining 
The sky was a Kingdom 
All covered in blood 
The moon and the stars 
Where the troops that lay conquered 
Like fruit left to wither 
Poor spiritual food 
 
And the spears of bright sun 
All brave with it conquest 
Did hover unearthly 
In banners of fire 
I kneit in the garden 
Awash with the dawning 
And a voice came so brightly 
I covered my eyes 
 
Thank you for giving 
This bright new morning 
So steeped seemed the evening 
In darkness and blood 
There'll be no sadness 
There'll be no sorrow 
There'll be no road too narrow 
There'll be a new day 
And it's today 
For us

NOBODY'S BABY NOW

 I've searched the holy books 
I tried to unravel the mystery of Jesus Christ, the saviour 
I've read the poets and the analysts 
Searched through the books on human behaviour 
I travelled this world around 
For an answer that refused to be found 
I don't know why and I don't know how 
But she's nobody's baby now 
 
I loved her then and I guess I love her still 
Hers is the face I see when a certain mood moves in 
She lives in my blood and skin 
Her wild feral stare, her dark hair 
Her winter lips as cold as stone 
Yeah, I was her man 
But there are some things love won't allow 
I held her hand but I don't hold it now 
I don't know why and I don't know how 
But she's nobody's baby now 
 
This is her dress that I loved best 
With the blue quilted violets across the breast 
And these are my many letters 
Torn to pieces by her long fingered hand 
I was her cruel hearted man 
And though I've tried to lay her ghost down 
She's moving through me, even now 
I don't know why and I don't know how 
But she's nobody's baby now 
She's nobody's baby now 
Nobody's baby now 
She's nobody's baby now

O'MALLEY'S BAR

 I am tall and I am thin 
Of an enviable hight 
And I've been known to be quite handsome 
In a certain angle and in certain light 
Well I entered into O'Malley's 
Said, O'Malley I have a thirst 
O'Malley merely smiled at me 
Said You wouldn't be the first 
I knocked on the bar and pointed 
To a bottle on the shelf 
And as O'Malley poured me out a drink 
I sniffed and crossed myself 
My hand decided that the time was nigh 
And for a moment it slipped from view 
And when it returned, it fairly burned 
With confidence anew 
Well the thunder from my steely fist 
Made all the glasses jangle 
When I shot him, I was so handsome 
It was the light, it was the angle 
Huh! Hmmmmmm 
 Neighbours! I cried, Friends! I screamed 
I banged my fist upon the bar 
 I bear no grudge against you! 
And my dick felt long and hard 
 I am the man for which no God waits 
But for which the whole world yearns 
I'm marked by darkness and by blood 
And one thousand powder burns 
Well, you know those fish with the swollen lips 
That clean the ocean floor 
When I looked at poor O'Malley's wife 
That's exactly what I saw 
I jammed the barrel under her chin 
And her face looked raw and vicious 
Her head it landed in the sink 
With all the dirty dishes 
Her little daughter Siobhan 
Pulled beers from dusk till down 
And amongst the townfolk she was a bit of a joke 
But she pulled the best beer in town 
I swooped magnificent upon her 
As she sat shivering in her grief 
Like the Madonna painted on the church house wall 
In whale's blood and banana leaf 
Her throat it crumbled in my fist 
And I spun heroically around 
To see Caffrey rising from his seat 
I shot that mother fucker down 
Mmmmmmmmmm Yeah Yeah Yeah 
 I have no free will , I sang 
As I flew about the murder 
Mrs. Richard Holmes, she screamed 
You really should have heard her 
I sang and I laughed, I howled and I wept 
I panted like a pup 
I blew a hole in Mrs. Richard Holmes 
And her husband stupidly stood up 
As he screamed, You are an evil man 
And I paused a while to wonder 
 If I have no free will then how can I 
Be morally culpable, I wonder 
I shot Richard Holmes in the stomach 
And gingerly he sat down 
And he whispered weirdly, No offense 
And then lay upon the ground 
 None taken , I replied to him 
To which he gave a little cough 
With blazing wings I neatly aimed 
And blew his head completely off 
I've lived in this town for thirty years 
And to no one I am a stranger 
And I put new bullets in my gun 
Chamber upon chamber 
And I turned my gun on the bird like Mr. Brookes 
I thought of Saint Francis and his sparrows 
And as I shot down the youthful Richardson 
It was St. Sebastian I thought of, and his arrows 
Hhhhhhhhhh Mmmmmmmmmmmm 
I said, I want to introduce myself 
And I am glad that all you came 
And I leapt upon the bar 
And shouted out my name 
Well Jerry Bellows, he hugged his stool 
Closed his eyes and shrugged and laughed 
And with an ashtray as big as a fucking really big brick 
I split his head in half 
His blood spilled across the bar 
Like a steaming scarlet brook 
And I knelt at it's edge on the counter 
Wiped the tears away and looked 
Well, the light in there was blinding 
Full of God and ghosts of truth 
I smiled at Henry Davenport 
Who made an attempt to move 
Well, from the position I was standing 
The strangest thing I ever saw 
The bullet entered through the top of his chest 
And blew his bowels out on the floor 
Well I floated down the counter 
Showing no remorse 
I shot a hole in Kathleen Carpenter 
Recently divorced 
But remorse i felt and remorse I had 
It clung to every thing 
From the raven's hair upon my head 
To the feathers on my wings 
Remorse sqeezed my hand in it's fradulent claw 
With it's golden hairless chest 
And I glided through the bodies 
And killed the fat man Vincent West 
Who sat quietly in his chair 
A man become a child 
And I raised the gun up to his head 
Executioner style 
He made no attempt to resist 
So fat and dull and lazy 
 Did you know I lived in your street? I said 
And he looked at me as though I were crazy 
 O , he said, I had no idea 
And he grew as quiet as a mouse 
And the roar of the pistol when it went off 
Near blew that hat right off the house 
Hmmmmmm Uh Uh 
Well, I caught my eye in the mirror 
And gave it a long and loving inspection 
 There stands some kind of man , I roared 
And there did, in the reflection 
My hair combed back like a raven's wing 
My muscles hard and tight 
And curling from the business end of my gun 
Was a query mark of cordite 
Well I spun to the left, I spun to the right 
And I spun to the left again 
 Fear me! Fear me! Fear me! 
But no one did cause they were dead 
Huh! Hmmmmmmmmm 
And then there were the police sirens wailing 
And a bull horn squelched and blared 
 Drop your weapons and come out 
With your hands held in the air 
Well, I checked the chamber of my gun 
Saw I had one final bullet left 
My hand, it looked almost human 
As I raised it to my head 
 Drop your weapon and come out! 
Keep your hands above your head! 
I had one one long hard think about dying 
And did exactly what they said 
There must have been fifty cops out there 
In a circle around O'Malley's bar 
 Don't shoot , I cried, I'm a man unarmed! 
So they put me in their car 
And they sped me away from that terrible scene 
And I glanced out of the window 
Saw O'Malley's bar, saw the cops and the cars 
And I started counting on my fingers 
Aaaaaah One Aaaaaah Two Aaaaaah Three Aaaaaaah Four 
O'Malley's bar O'Malley's bar

 


OH MY LORD

 I thought I'd take a walk today 
It's a mistake I sometimes make 
My children lay asleep in bed 
My wife lay wide awake 
I kissed her softly on the brow 
I tried not to make a sound 
But with stony eyes she looked at me 
And gently squeezed my hand 
Call it a premonition, call it a crazy vision 
Call it intuition, something learned from mother 
But when she looked up at me, I could clearly see 
The Sword of Damocles hanging directly above her 
Oh Lord Oh my Lord 
Oh Lord 
How have I offended thee? 
Wrap your tender arms around me 
Oh Lord Oh Lord 
Oh My Lord 
 
They called at me through the fence 
They were not making any sense 
They claimed that I had lost the plot 
Kept saying that I was not 
The man I used to be 
They held their babes aloft 
Threw marsh mellows at the Security 
And said that I'd grown soft 
Call it intuition, call it a creeping suspicion, 
But their words of derision meant they hardly knew me 
For even I could see in the way they looked at me 
The Spear of Destiny sticking right through me 
Oh Lord Oh my lord 
Oh Lord 
How have I offended thee? 
Wrap your tender arms round me 
Oh Lord Oh lord 
Oh My Lord 
 
Now I'm at the hairdressers 
People watch me as they move past 
A guy wearing plastic antlers 
Presses his bum against the glass 
Now I'm down on my hands and knees 
And it's so fucking hot! 
Someone cries, What are you looking for? 
I scream, The plot, the plot! 
I grab my telephone, I call my wife at home 
She screams, Leave us alone! I say, Hey, it's only me 
The hairdresser with his scissors, he holds up the mirror 
I look back and shiver; I can't even believe what I can see 
 
Be mindful of the prayers you send 
Pray hard but pray with care 
For the tears that you are crying now 
Are just your answered prayers 
The ladders of life that we scale merrily 
Move mysteriously around 
So that when you think you're climbing up, man 
In fact you're climbing down 
Into the hollows of glamour, where with spikes and hammer 
With telescopic camera, they chose to turn the screw 
Oh I hate them, Ma! Oh I hate them, Pa! 
Oh I hate them all for what they went and done to you 
Oh Lord Oh my Lord 
Oh Lord 
How have I offended thee? 
Wrap your tender arms round me 
Oh Lord Oh Lord 
Oh My Lord

 


PAPA WON'T LEAVE YOU, HENRY

 I went out walking the other day 
The wind hung wet around my neck 
My head it rung with screams and groans 
From the night I spent amongst her bones 
I passed beside the mission house 
Where that mad old buzzard, the reverend, 
Shrieked and flapped about life after your dead 
Well, I thought about my friend, Michel 
How they rolled him in linoleum 
And shot him in the neck 
A bloody halo, like a think bubble 
Circling his head 
And I bellowed at the firmament 
Looks like the rains are hear to stay 
And the rain pissed down upon me 
And washed me all away 
Saying 
 
Papa won't leave you, Henry 
Papa won't leave you, Boy 
Papa won't leave you, Henry 
Papa won't leave you, Boy 
Well, the road is long 
And the road is hard 
And many fall by the side 
But Papa won't leave you, Henry 
So there ain't no need to cry 
 
And I went on down the road 
He went on down the road 
And I went on down the road 
He went on down the road 
 
Well, the moon it looked exhausted 
Like something you should pity 
Spent an age spotted 
Above the sizzling wires of the city 
Well, it reminded me of her face 
Her bleached and hungry eyes 
Her hair was like a curtain 
Falling open with the laughter 
And closing with the lies 
But the ghost of her still lingers on 
Though she's passed through me 
And is gone 
The slum dogs, they are barking 
And the rain children on the streets 
And the tears that we will weep today 
Will all be washed away 
By the tears that we will weep again tomorrow 
 
Papa won't leave you, Henry 
Papa won't leave you, Boy 
Papa won't leave you, Henry 
Papa won't leave you, Boy 
For the road is long 
And the road is hard 
And many fall by the side 
But Papa won't leave you, Henry 
So there ain't no need to cry 
 
And I went on down the road 
He went on down the road 
And I went on down the road 
He went on down the road 
 
And I came upon a little house 
A little house upon a hill 
And I entered through, the curtain hissed 
Into the house with its blood red bowels 
Where wet lipped women with greasy fists 
Crawled the ceilings and the walls 
They filled me full of drink 
And led me round the rooms 
Naked and cold and grinning 
Until everything went black 
And I came down spinning 
I awoke so drunk and full of rage 
That I could hardly speak 
A fag in a whale bone corset 
Draping his dick across my cheek 
And its into the shame 
And its into a guilt 
And its into the fucking fray 
And the walls ran red around me 
A warm arterial spray 
Saying 
 
Papa won't leave you, Henry 
Papa won't leave you, Boy 
Papa won't leave you, Henry 
Papa won't leave you, Boy 
Well, the night is dark 
And the night is deep 
And its jaws are open wide 
But Papa won't leave you, Henry 
So there ain't no need to cry 
 
And I went on down the road 
He went on down the road 
And I went on down the road 
He went on down the road 
 
It's the rainy season where I'm living 
Death comes leaping out of every doorway 
Wasting you for money, for your clothes 
And for your nothing 
Entire towns being washed away 
Favelas exploding on inflammable spillways 
Lynch mobs, death squads, babies being born without brains 
The mad heat and the relentless rains 
And if you stick your arm into that hole 
It comes out sheared off to the bone 
And with her kisses bubbling on my lips 
I swiped the rain and nearly missed 
And I went on down the road 
He went on down the road 
Singing 
 
Papa won't leave you, Henry 
Papa won't leave you, Boy 
Papa won't leave you, Henry 
Papa won't leave you, Boy 
Well, the road is long 
And the road is hard 
And many fall by the side 
But Papa won't leave you, Henry 
So there ain't no need to cry 
 
And I went on down the road 
He went on down the road 
And I went on down the road 
He went on down the road 
Bent Beneath my heavy load 
Under his heavy load 
Yeah, I went on down the road 
Yeah, he went on down the road 
 
Woah, woah 
Woah, woah 
Woah, woah 
Woah, woah 
And I went on down that road

Papa won't leave you, Boy 
Papa won't leave you, Henry 
Papa won't leave you, Boy 
Well, the road is long 
And the road is hard 
And many fall by the side 
But Papa won't leave you, Henry 
So there ain't no need to cry 
 
And I went on down the road 
He went on down the road 
And I went on down the road 
He went on down the road 
 
Well, the moon it looked exhausted 
Like something you should pity 
Spent an age spotted 
Above the sizzling wires of the city 
Well, it reminded me of her face 
Her bleached and hungry eyes 
Her hair was like a curtain 
Falling open with the laughter 
And closing with the lies 
But the ghost of her still lingers on 
Though she's passed through me 
And is gone 
The slum dogs, they are barking 
And the rain children on the streets 
And the tears that we will weep today 
Will all be washed away 
By the tears that we will weep again tomorrow 
 
Papa won't leave you, Henry 
Papa won't leave you, Boy 
Papa won't leave you, Henry 
Papa won't leave you, Boy 
For the road is long 
And the road is hard 
And many fall by the side 
But Papa won't leave you, Henry 
So there ain't no need to cry 
 
And I went on down the road 
He went on down the road 
And I went on down the road 
He went on down the road 
 
And I came upon a little house 
A little house upon a hill 
And I entered through, the curtain hissed 
Into the house with its blood red bowels 
Where wet lipped women with greasy fists 
Crawled the ceilings and the walls 
They filled me full of drink 
And led me round the rooms 
Naked and cold and grinning 
Until everything went black 
And I came down spinning 
I awoke so drunk and full of rage 
That I could hardly speak 
A fag in a whale bone corset 
Draping his dick across my cheek 
And its into the shame 
And its into a guilt 
And its into the fucking fray 
And the walls ran red around me 
A warm arterial spray 
Saying 
 
Papa won't leave you, Henry 
Papa won't leave you, Boy 
Papa won't leave you, Henry 
Papa won't leave you, Boy 
Well, the night is dark 
And the night is deep 
And its jaws are open wide 
But Papa won't leave you, Henry 
So there ain't no need to cry 
 
And I went on down the road 
He went on down the road 
And I went on down the road 
He went on down the road 
 
It's the rainy season where I'm living 
Death comes leaping out of every doorway 
Wasting you for money, for your clothes 
And for your nothing 
Entire towns being washed away 
Favelas exploding on inflammable spillways 
Lynch mobs, death squads, babies being born without brains 
The mad heat and the relentless rains 
And if you stick your arm into that hole 
It comes out sheared off to the bone 
And with her kisses bubbling on my lips 
I swiped the rain and nearly missed 
And I went on down the road 
He went on down the road 
Singing 
 
Papa won't leave you, Henry 
Papa won't leave you, Boy 
Papa won't leave you, Henry 
Papa won't leave you, Boy 
Well, the road is long 
And the road is hard 
And many fall by the side 
But Papa won't leave you, Henry 
So there ain't no need to cry 
 
And I went on down the road 
He went on down the road 
And I went on down the road 
He went on down the road 
Bent Beneath my heavy load 
Under his heavy load 
Yeah, I went on down the road 
Yeah, he went on down the road 
 
Woah, woah 
Woah, woah 
Woah, woah 
Woah, woah 
And I went on down that road

 


PEOPLE AIN'T NO GOOD

 People just ain't no good 
I think that's welll understood 
You can see it everywhere you look 
People just ain't no good 
 
We were married under cherry trees 
Under blossom we made pour vows 
All the blossoms come sailing down 
Through the streets and through the playgrounds 
 
The sun would stream on the sheets 
Awoken by the morning bird 
We'd buy the Sunday newspapers 
And never read a single word 
 
People they ain't no good 
People they ain't no good 
People they ain't no good 
 
Seasons came, Seasons went 
The winter stripped the blossoms bare 
A different tree now lines the streets 
Shaking its fists in the air 
The winter slammed us like a fist 
The windows rattling in the gales 
To which she drew the curtains 
Made out of her wedding veils 
 
People they ain't no good 
People they ain't no good 
People they ain't no good at all 
 
To our love send a dozen white lilies 
To our love send a coffin of wood 
To our love let aal the pink eyed pigeons coo 
That people they just ain't no good 
To our love send back all the letters 
To our love a valentine of blood 
To our love let all the jilted lovers cry 
That people they just ain't no good 
 
It ain't that in their hearts they're bad 
They can comfort you, some even try 
They nurse you when you're ill of health 
They bury you when you go and die 
It ain't that in their hearts they're bad 
They'd stick by you if they could 
But that's just bullshit 
People just ain't no good 
 
People they ain't no good 
People they ain't no good 
People they ain't no good 
People they ain't no good at all

 


PLAIN GOLD RING

 

 


RED RIGHT HAND

 Take a litle walk to the edge of town 
Go across the tracks 
Where the viaduct looms, 
like a bird of doom 
As it shifts and cracks 
Where secrets lie in the border fires, 
in the humming wires 
Hey man, you know 
you're never coming back 
Past the square, past the bridge, 
past the mills, past the stacks 
On a gathering storm comes 
a tall handsome man 
In a dusty black coat with 
a red right hand 
 
He'll wrap you in his arms, 
tell you that you've been a good boy 
He'll rekindle all the dreams 
it took you a lifetime to destroy 
He'll reach deep into the hole, 
heal your shrinking soul 
Hey buddy, you know you're 
never ever coming back 
He's a god, he's a man, 
he's a ghost, he's a guru 
They're whispering his name 
through this disappearing land 
But hidden in his coat 
is a red right hand 
 
You ain't got no money? 
He'll get you some 
You ain't got no car? He'll get you one 
You ain't got no self respect, 
you feel like an insect 
Well don't you worry buddy, 
cause here he comes 
Through the ghettos and the barrio 
and the bowery and the slum 
A shadow is cast wherever he stands 
Stacks of green paper in his 
red right hand 
 
(Organ solo) 
 
You'll see him in your nightmares, 
you'll see him in your dreams 
He'll appear out of nowhere but 
he ain't what he seems 
You'll see him in your head, 
on the TV screen 
And hey buddy, I'm warning 
you to turn it off 
He's a ghost, he's a god, 
he's a man, he's a guru 
You're one microscopic cog 
in his catastrophic plan 
Designed and directed by 
his red right hand 
 
(Organ solo) 
Extra verse from DJ Spooky Remix (From Scream 2 Soundtrack): 
He'll extend his hand, real slowly for a shake 
You'll see it coming toward you, real slowly for a shake 
(Grabbing at your peril buddy?) cause you know you ain't 
getting near much as he will take. 
 
He's a... 
He's mumbling words you can't understand 
He's mumbling word behind his red right hand.

RIGHT NOW I'M A ROAMING

 When I get home, I'm gunna clean up my house 
When I get home, I'm gunna kick out that mouse 
When I get home, I'm gunna put things in order 
but right now, right right now, right now I'm a roaming 
 
When I get home, I'm gunna make that call 
When I get home, I'm gunna talk it through 
When I get home, I'm gunna straighten it out 
but right now, right now, right now I'm a roaming 
 
When I get home, I'm gunna give up the booze 
When I get home, I'm gunna get me some food 
When I get home, I'm gunna quit them drugs 
but right now, right now, right now I'm a roaming 
 
When I get home, I'm gunna call my mother 
When I get home, I'm gunna cook her some dinner 
When I get home, I'm gunna invite my brothers 
but right now, right right now, right now I'm a roaming 
 
When I get home, I'm gunna see my little boy 
When I get home, I'm buy him a little toy 
When I get home, he's gunna jump for joy 
but right now, right right now, right now I'm a roaming 
 
When I get home, I'm gunna unpack my bags 
When I get home, I'm gunna waash these dirty rags 
When I get home, I'm gunna pack 'em up again 
but I'm gunna go, I'm gunna go, I'm gunna go right back roaming.

 


RIGHT OUT OF YOUR HAND

 Please forgive me 
If I appear unkind 
But any fool can tell you 
It s all in your mind 
 
Down in the meadow 
The old lion stirs 
Puts his hand ?cross his mouth 
He has no use for words 
 
Poor little girl 
With your handful of snow 
Poor little girl 
Had no way to know 
 
And you ve got me eating 
You ve got me eating 
You ve got me eating 
Right out of your hand 
 
I mean you no harm 
When I tell you you re blind 
Give a sucker an even break 
He ll lose it all, every time 
 
The airborne starlings circle 
Over the frozen fields 
The hollyhocks hang harmlessly 
And the old lion yields 
 
And you ve got me eating 
You ve got me eating 
You ve got me eating 
Right out of your hand

 


ROCK OF GIBRALTAR

 Let me say this to you 
I ll be steadfast and true 
And my love will never falter 
 
The sea would crash about us 
The waves would lash about us 
I ll be your Rock of Gibraltar 
 
Sometimes it s hard 
And we re both caught off guard 
But there s nothing I would ever alter 
 
The wind could howl round our ears 
For the next thousand years 
I d still be your Rock of Gibraltar 
 
The best thing I done 
Was to make you the one 
Who I d walk with down to the altar 
 
You d stand by me 
And together we d be 
That great, steady Rock of Gibraltar 
 
Under the big yellow moon 
On our honeymoon 
I took you on a trip to Malta 
 
And all through the night 
You held me so tight 
Your great, steady Rock of Gibraltar 
 
Could the powers that be 
Ever foresee 
That things could so utterly alter? 
 
All the plans that we laid 
Could soon be betrayed 
Betrayed like the Rock of Gibraltar

 


RUNNING SCARED

 Just running scared, each place we go 
So afraid, that he might show 
 
Yeah, running scared, what would I do 
If he came back and wanted you? 
 
Just running scared, feeling low 
Running scared that you love him so 
 
Just running scared, afraid to lose 
If he came back, which one would you choose? 
 
And then all at once, he was standing there 
So sure of himself, his head in the air 
While my heart was breaking, which one would it be? 
Then you turned round and walked right out on me

 


SAD WATERS

 Down the road I look and there runs Mary 
Hair of gold and lips like cherries 
We go down to the river where the willows weep 
Take a naked root for a lovers seat 
That rose out of the bitten soil 
But sound to the ground by creeping ivy coils 
O Mary you have seduced my soul 
And I don't know right from wrong 
Forever a hostage of your child's world 
 
And then I ran my tin cup heart along 
The prison of her ribs 
And with a toss of her curls 
That little girl goes wading in 
Rollin her dress up past her knee 
Turning these waters into wine 
Then she platted all the willow vines 
 
Mary in the shallows laughing 
Over where the carp dart 
Spooked by the new shadows that she cast 
Across these sad waters and across my heart

 


SAINT HUCK

 Born of the river, 
Born of its ever changing, never changing murky water 
Oh riverboat just rollin' along through the great great greasy city 
Huck standing like a Saint, upon its deck 
If ya wanna catch a Saint, 
then bait ya hook, let's take a walk... 
 
'O come to me!, O come to me!' is what the dirty city 
say to Huck... HUCK 
 
woah woah, woah woah! 
woah woah, woah woah! 
Saint Huck! Huck! 
 
Straight in the arms of the city goes Huck, 
down the beckonin' streets of op po tunity 
whistling his favorite river song... 
And a bad blind nigger at the piano 
Buts a sinister blooo lilt into that sing a long 
Huck senses somthing's wrong! 
 
Sirens wail in the city, 
and lil Ulysses turn to putty 
and Ol Man River's got a bone to pick! 
and our boy's hardly got a bone to suck! 
He go, woah woah, woah woah! 
woah woah, woah woah! 
Saint Huck! Huck! 
 
The mo o o on, its huge cycloptic eye 
watches the city streets contract 
twist and cripple and crack. 
Saint Huck goes on a dog's leg now 
Saint Huck goes on a dog's leg now 
 
You know the story! 
Ya wake up one morning and you find you're a thug 
blowing smoke rings in some dive 
Ya fingers hot and itchin, ya cracking ya knuckles 
Ya bull neck bristling... 
Still Huck he ventures on whistling, 
and Death reckons Huckleberry's time is up, 
O woah woah woah! 
Saint Huck! 
O woah woah woah! 
Saint Huck! Huck! 
 
Yonder go Huck, minus pocket watch an' wallet gone 
Skin shrink wraps his skeleton 
No wonder he gets thinner, what with his cold'n'skinny dinners! 
Saint Huck a Saint Elvis, Saint Huck a Saint Elvis 
O you recall the song ya used to sing a long 
Shifting the river trade on that ol' steamer 
Life is but a dream! 
 
But ya traded in the Mighty ol' man River 
for the Dirty ol' Man Latrine! 
The brothel shift 
The hustle'n'the bustle and the green backs rustle 
And all the sexy cash 
And the randy cars 
And the two dollar fucks 
O o o ya outa luck, ya outa luck 
Woah woah woah woah 
Saint Huck! Huck! 
 
This is the track of deception 
leads to the heart of despair 
Huck whistles like he just don't care 
but in the pocket of the jacket is a chamber 
Lead pellets sleeps in there 
Wake Up! 
 
Now Huck whistles and he kneels 
and he lays down there 
See ya huck, good luck 
A smoke ring hovers above his head 
And the rats and the dogs and the men all come 
and put a bullet through his eye 
and the drip and the drip and the drip of the Mississippi cryin' 
And Saint Huck hears his own Mississippi just rollin' by him 
Woah woah woah woah 
Woah woah woah woah 
Saint Huck! Saint Huck! Saint Huck! 
Woah woah woah woah 
Woah woah woah woah 
Saint Huck! Saint Huck! Saint Huck! 
Woah woah woah woah

 


SAY GOODBYE TO THE LITTLE GIRL TREE

 O say goodbye to the little girl tree 
O you know that I must say goodbye 
To the little girl tree 
This wall I built around you 
Is made out of stone lies 
O little girl the truth would be 
An axe in thee 
O father look to your daughter 
Brick of grief and stricken morter 
With this ring 
This silver hoop of wire 
I bind your maiden mainstem 
Just to keep you as a child 
 
O say goodbye to the little girl tree 
O you know that I must say goodbye 
To my little girl tree 
How fast your candy bones 
Reached out for me 
I must say goodbye to your brittle bones 
Crying out for me 
O you know that I must say goodbye 
O goodbye 
Even though you will betray me 
The very minute that I leave 
 
O say goodbye to the little girl tree 
O Lord you know that I must say goodbye 
To that little girl tree 
I rise up her girl child lumps and slipping knots 
Into her laden boughs 
And amongst her roping limbs 
Like a swollen neck vein branching 
Into smaller lesser veins 
That must all just sing and say goodbye 
And let her blossom veils fly 
Her velvet gown 
Down down down 
Down down down 
Down down down and goodbye 
For you know that I must say goodbye 
 
To a rhythm softly tortured 
Of a motion back and forth 
Thats a rhythm sweetly tortured 
O that's the rhythm of the orchard 
And you know that I must say goodbye 
To that little girl tree 
O goodbye 
Yes goodbye 
For you know that I must die 
Down down down 
Down down down 
Down down down and goodbye 
For you know that I must die 
Yes you know that I must die 
O o you know that I must die

 


SCUM

 Well, I lived with one 
Well, I lived with one, I lived with two, 
I even lived with a third 
I wanna tell you about number one 
He was a miserable shitwringing turd 
Like he reminded me of some evil gnome 
Shakin hands was like shakin a hot, fat, oily bone 
Holdin on for far too long 
Yes he took me in, he took me in 
He said that I looked pale and thin 
I told him he looked fat 
His lips were red and lickin wet 
His house was roastin hot 
In fact it was a fuckin slum 
Scum! Scum! 
Well then he hooked up with some slut from the same game 
Black snow! Black snow! 
Cocksuckstress, and I should know 
Mean and vicious, her microphone always smelled suspicious 
His and herpes bath towel type 
If you know what I mean 
I could not look at him, worm 
He'd be takin a shower and who should walk in 
He was the epitome of their type 
Her middle name was Welcome, his was Wipe 
Scum! Scum! 
Well you're on the shit list 
Thrust and twist, twist and screw 
You gave me a bad review 
And maybe you think that it's all just water under the bridge 
Well my UNfriend, I'm the type that holds a grudge 
I'm your creator 
I think you fuckin traitor, chronic masturbator, 
Shitlicker, user, self abuser, jigger jigger! 
What rock did you crawl from? 
Which ..... did you come? 
You Judas, Brutus, Vitus, Scum! 
Hey four eyes, come 
That's right, it's a gun 
Face is bubble, blood, and ...... street 
Snowman with six holes clean into his fat fuckin guts 
Psychotic drama mounts 
Guts well deep then a spring is fount (?) 
I unload into his eyes 
Blood springs 
Dead snow 
Blue skies

 


SHE FELL AWAY

 Once she lay open like a road 
Carbed apart the madness that I stumbled from 
But she fell away 
She fell away 
Shed me like a skin 
She fell away 
Left me holding everything 
 
Once the road lay open like a girl 
And we drank and laughed and threw the bottle over 
But she fell away 
She fell away 
I did not see the cracks form 
As I knelt to pray 
I did not see the crevice yawn, no 
 
Sometimes 
At night I feel the end it is at hand 
My pistol going crazy in my hand 
For she fell away 
O she fell away 
Walked me th the brink 
The fell away 
I did not see her fall 
To better days 
Sometimes I wonder was she ever there at all 
She fell away 
She fell away 
She fell away

 


SHE PASSED BY MY WINDOW

 She passed by my window 
Her eyes were all aglow 
And bent to pick her glove she d dropped 
From the bright and brittle snow 
 
Nature had spoken it in the Spring 
With apple, plum and brand new pear 
Have you time for my company? 
No, I said, I have none to spare 
 
You gotta sanctify my love 
You gotta sanctify my love 
You gotta sanctify my love 
I ain t no lover boy 
 
For apple, plum and brand new pear 
Soon wither on the ground 
She slapped the snow from off her glove 
And moved on without a sound 
 
You gotta sanctify my love 
You gotta sanctify my love 
You gotta sanctify my love 
I ain t no lover boy

 


SLEEPING ANALEAH

 Yesterday the sun was shining but you're finding the sun it 
Don't shine all the time 
A winter day suddenly came your way 
And you ran into your mind 
 
Sleeping Analeah, Weeping Analeah 
Do you think you're ready for me? 
 
Oh and yesterday is gone forever and ever, never 
To be again 
You looked for the sunshine, that brought warmth to your mind 
But find only rain 
 
Sleeping Analeah, Weeping Analeah 
No, you're not ready for me 
 
But when yesterday becomes a memory, a memory 
That we uncovered in time 
If you still remember that cold September 
I reigned in your mind 
 
Sleeping Analeah, Weeping Analeah 
Then you'd be ready for me

 


SLOWLY GOES THE NIGHT

 Lover, lover, goodbye 
So slowly goes the night 
I trace the print of your body with my hand 
Like the map of some forbidden land 
I trace the ghosts of your bones 
With my trembling hand 
Dark is my night 
But darker is my day yeah 
I must've been blind 
Out of my mind 
Not to read the warning signs 
How goes it? 
It goes lonely 
Goes slowly 
 
So slowly goes the night 
Ten lonely days, ten lonely nights 
I watch the moon get flayed anew 
Until the moom becomes the skinning tool 
I send the skins of my sins out to cover and comfort you 
I know of a Heaven 
And honey I know of a Hell yeah 
I hang my head 
In my bed 
And remember what you said 
 One evening, I'm leaving 
And I laughed and checked her breathing 
And said darling 
 
Go slowly through the knight 
O baby, I feel the heal of time 
I wake to find you sitting here 
Cutting tangels out of your hair 
Singing a song that's all wrong 
Hey, but that's alright, I don't care 
O darling forgive me 
For all the misery yeah 
I embrace an empty space 
And your laughing song it fades 
Where goes it? 
It goes some place 
Where it's lonely 
 
And black as the night 
Come back, darling and put things right 
I hang my head and cry cry cry 
Darling, all night I try 
To cease on a reason for this mad mad season 
The nights, they are so long now 
I can't remember it being light 
Call it sleep, call it death, call it what you like 
But only sleep, dear 
Only sleep brings you back to life yeah 
I hang my head 
I toss and I sweat 
I never never can forget 
How goes it? 
I'm going, but slowly slowly going 
And we both know that it's gonna be alright 
 
But it ain't you who has to cry cry cry 
Ten lonely days, ten lonely nights 
Since you left my side side side

 


SOMETHING'S GOTTEN HOLD OF MY HEART

 Something's gotten hold of my heart 
Keeping my soul and my senses apart 
Something's gotten into my life 
Cutting its way through my dreams like a knife 
Turning me up and turning me down 
Making me smile and making me frown 
 
In a world that was small 
I once lived in a time there was peace with no trouble at all 
But then you came my way 
And a feeling unknown shook my heart, made me want you to stay 
All of my nights and all of my days 
 
I gotta tell you now 
Something's gotten hold of my hand 
Dragging my soul to a beautiful land 
Something has invaded my nights 
Painting my sleep with a colour so bright 
Changing the grey and changing the blue 
Scarlet for me and scarlet for you 
 
I've got to know if this is the real thing 
I've got to know what's making my heart sing 
You smile and I am lost for a lifetime 
Each minute spent with you is the right time 
Every hour, every day 
You touch me and my mind goes astray

 


SONG OF JOY

 Have mercy on me, sir 
Allow me to impose on you 
I have no place to stay 
And my bones are cold right through 
I will tell you a story 
Of a man and his family 
And I swear that it is true 
Ten years ago I met a girl named Joy 
She was a sweet and happy thing 
Her eyes were bright blue jewels 
And we were married in the spring 
I had no idea what happiness and little love could bring 
Or what life had in store 
But all things move toward their end 
All things move toward their their end 
On that you can be sure 
La la la la la la la la la la 
La la la la la la la la la la 
Then one morning I awoke to find her weeping 
And for many days to follow 
She grew so sad and lonely 
Became Joy in name only 
Within her breast there launched an unnamed sorrow 
And a dark and grim force set sail 
Farewell happy fields 
Where joy forever dwells 
* Hail horrors hail * 
Was it an act of contrition or some awful premonition 
As if she saw into the heart of her final blood soaked night 
Those lunatic eyes, that hungry kitchen knife 
Ah, I see sir, that I have your attention! 
Well, could it be? 
How often I've asked that question 
Well, then in quick succession 
We had babies, one, two, three 
We called them Hilda, Hattie and Holly 
They were their mother's children 
Their eyes were bright blue jewels 
And they were quiet as a mouse 
There was no laughter in the house 
No, not from Hilda, Hattie or Holly 
 No wonder , people said, poor mother Joy's so melancholy 
Well, one night there came a visitor to our little home 
I was visiting a sick friend 
I was a doctor then 
Joy and the girls were on their own 
La la la la la la la la la la 
La la la la la la la la la la 
Joy had been bound with electrical tape 
In her mouth a gag 
She'd been stabbed repeatedly 
And stuffed into a sleeping bag 
In their very cots my girls were robbed of their lives 
Method of murder much the same as my wife's 
Method of murder much the same as my wife's 
It was midnight when I arrived home 
Said to the police on the telephone 
Someone's taken four innocent lives 
They never caught the man 
He's still on the loose 
It seems he has done many many more 
Quotes John Milton on the walls in the victim's blood 
The police are investigating at tremendous cost 
In my house he wrote his red right hand 
That, I'm told is from Paradise Lost 
The wind round here gets wicked cold 
But my story is nearly told 
I fear the morning will bring quite a frost 
And so I've left my home 
I drift from land to land 
I am upon your step and you are a family man 
Outside the vultures wheel 
The wolves howl, the serpents hiss 
And to extend this small favour, friend 
Would be the sum of earthly bliss 
Do you reckon me a friend? 
The sun to me is dark 
And silent as the moon 
Do you, sir, have a room? 
Are you beckoning me in? 
La la la la la la la la la la 
La la la la la la la la la la

 


SORROW'S CHILD

 Sorrow's child sits by the river 
Sorrow's child hears not the water 
Sorrow's child sits by the river 
Sorrow's child hears not the water 
And just when it seems as though 
You've got strength enough to stand 
Sorrow's child all weak and strange 
Stands waiting at your hand 
 
Sorrow's child steps in the water 
Sorrow's child you follow after 
Sorrow's child wades in deeper 
Sorrow's child invites you under 
And just when you thought as though 
All your tears were wept and done 
Sorrow's child grieves not what has passed 
But all the past still yet to come 
Sorrow's child sits by the water 
Sorrow's child your arms enfold her 
Sorrow's child you're loathe to befriend her 
Sorrow's child but in sorrow surrender 
And just when is seems as though 
All your tears were at an end 
Sorrow's child lifts up her hand 
And she brings it down again

 


STAGGER LEE

 It was back in '32 when times were hard 
He had a Colt .45 and a deck of cards 
Stagger Lee 
He wore rat drawn shoes and an old stetson hat 
Had a '28 Ford, had payments on that 
Stagger Lee 
His woman threw him out in the ice and snow 
And told him, Never ever come back no more 
Stagger Lee 
So he walked through the rain and he walked through the mud 
Till he came to a place called The Bucket Of Blood 
Stagger Lee 
He said Mr Motherfucker, you know who I am 
The barkeeper said, No, and I don't give a good goddamn 
To Stagger Lee 
He said, Well bartender, it's plain to see 
I'm that bad motherfucker called Stagger Lee 
Mr. Stagger Lee 
Barkeep said, Yeah, I've heard your name down the way 
And I kick motherfucking asses like you every day 
Mr Stagger Lee 
Well those were the last words that the barkeep said 
'Cause Stag put four holes in his motherfucking head 
Just then in came a broad called Nellie Brown 
Was known to make more money than any bitch in town 
She struts across the bar, hitching up her skirt 
Over to Stagger Lee, she starts to flirt 
With Stagger Lee 
She saw the barkeep, said, O God, he can't be dead! 
Stag said, Well, just count the holes in the motherfucker's head 
She said, You ain't look like you scored in quite a time. 
Why not come to my pad? It won't cost you a dime 
Mr. Stagger Lee 
 But there's something I have to say before you begin 
You'll have to be gone before my man Billy Dilly comes in, 
Mr. Stagger Lee 
 I'll stay here till Billy comes in, till time comes to pass 
And furthermore I'll fuck Billy in his motherfucking ass 
Said Stagger Lee 
 I'm a bad motherfucker, don't you know 
And I'll crawl over fifty good pussies just to get one fat boy's asshole 
Said Stagger Lee 
Just then Billy Dilly rolls in and he says, You must be 
That bad motherfucker called Stagger Lee 
Stagger Lee 
 Yeah, I'm Stagger Lee and you better get down on your knees 
And suck my dick, because If you don't you're gonna be dead 
Said Stagger Lee 
Billy dropped down and slobbered on his head 
And Stag filled him full of lead 
Oh yeah.

 


STILL IN LOVE

 The cops are hanging around the house 
The cars outside look like they ve got the blues 
The moon don t know if it s day or night 
Everybody s creeping around with plastic covers on their shoes 
You re making coffee for everyone concerned 
Someone points to this and someone points to that 
Everyone is saying that you should lie down 
But you ain t having none of that 
And I say to the sleepy summer rain 
With a complete absence of pain 
You might think I m crazy 
But I m still in love with you 
 
Hide your eyes, hide your tears, 
Hide your face, my love 
Hide your ribbons, hide your bows 
Hide your coloured cotton gloves 
Hide your trinkets, hide your treasures 
Hide your neatly scissored locks 
Hide your memories, hide them all 
Stuff them in a cardboard box 
Or throw them into the street below 
Leave them to the wind and the rain and the snow 
For you might think I m crazy 
But I m still in love with you 
 
Call me up, baby, and I will answer your call 
Call me up but remember I am no use to you at all 
 
Now, you re standing at the top of the stairs 
One hand on the banister, a flower in your hair 
The other one resting on your hip 
Without a solitary care 
I fall to sleep in the summer rain 
With no single memory of pain 
And you might think I m crazy 
But I m still in love with you

 


STRAIGHT TO YOU

 All the towers of ivory are crumbling 
And the swallows have sharpened their beaks 
This is the time of our great undoing 
This is the time that I'll come running 
Straight to you 
For I am captured 
Straight to you 
For I am captured 
One more time 
 
The light in our window is fading 
The candle gutters on the ledge 
Well now sorrow, it comes a stealing 
And I'll cry, girl, but I'll come a running 
Straight to you 
For I am captured 
Straight to you 
For I am captured 
Once again 
 
Gone are the days of rainbows 
Gone are the nights of swinging from the stars 
For the sea will swallow up the mountains 
And the sky will throw thunder bolts and sparks 
Straight at you 
But I'll come a running 
Straight to you 
But I'll come a running 
One more time 
 
Heaven has denied us its kingdom 
The saints are drunk howling at the moon 
The chariots of angels are colliding 
Well, I'll run, babe, but I'll come running 
Straight to you 
For I am captured 
Straight to you 
For I am captured 
One more time

STRANGER THAN KINDNESS

 Stranger than kindness 
Bottled light from hotels 
Spilling everything 
Wet hand from the volcano 
Sobers your skin 
Stranger than Kindness 
0nYou caress yourself 
And grind my soft cold bones below 
Your map of desire 
Burned in your flesh 
Even a fool can come 
A strange lit stair 
And find a rope hanging there 
Stranger than kindness 
 
Keys rain like heaven's hair 
There is no home there is no bread 
We sit at the gate and scratch 
 
The gaunt fruit of passion 
Dies in the light 
Stranger than kindness 
 
Your sleeping hands journey 
The loiter 
Stranger than kindness 
You hold me so carelessy close 
Tell me I'm dirty 
Stranger than kindness

SUGAR SUGAR SUGAR

 Sugar Sugar Sugar 
That man is bad 
The road he drives you down 
O sugar its a drag 
 
That road it twists 
That road is crossed 
Its down that road 
A lot of little girls go lost 
 
Sugar Sugar Sugar 
Keep on driving on 
Until the City of right 
Becomes the City of wrong 
 
That stretch is long 
You'll sleep and slide 
That stretch will find you 
Gagged and tied 
 
The hunter lies 
In a lowly ditch 
His eyes they sting 
And his fingers twitch 
 
You'll be his queen for the night 
But the morning you'll wake 
With the Lords and high ladies 
Of the bottom of the lake 
 
Sugar sugar sugar 
That man is wild 
And sugar, you know 
That you're merely a child 
 
He will laugh 
And hang your sheets to see 
The tokens of your virginity 
 
Sugar sugar sugar 
Honey you're so sweet 
And beside you baby 
Nothing can complete 
 
Sugar sugar sugar 
Honey your so sweet 
But beside you baby 
A bad man sleeps 
 
You better pray baby 
Pray baby, pray baby 
You better pray 
You better pray, baby 
Pray, baby, pray baby 
You better pray baby 
 
Sugar sugar sugar 
That man is bad 
And that's the bottom baby 
Coming right up ahead 
 
You can smell his fear 
You can smell his love 
As he wipes his mouth 
On your altar cloth 
 
Sugar sugar sugar 
Try to understand 
I'm an angel of God 
I'm your guardian 
 
He smells you innocence 
And like a dog he comes 
And like all the dogs he is 
I shut him down 
 
Sugar sugar sugar 
I can't explain 
Must I kill that cocksucker 
Everyday 
 
You better pray baby, pray baby, pray baby 
You better pray your daddy he ain't far away 
You better pray baby pray baby pray baby 
You better pray your daddy's come to take you away 
You better pray baby, pray baby, pray baby 
You better pray o tender prey baby tender prey 
You better pray tender pray baby tender prey

 


SUNDAY'S SLAVE

 Sunday's got a slave 
Monday's got one too 
Sunday's got a slave 
Monday's got one too 
Our sufferings are countless 
Our pleasures are motley few 
Spend all day digging my grave 
Now go get Sunday's slave 
 
Tuesday sleeps in a stable 
Wednesday's in a chains 
Tuesday gathers up the crumbs under the table 
Wednesday dare not complain 
My heart has collapsed on the tracks of a run a way train 
Just whisper his name 
And here comes Sunday's slave 
 
The hands in the stable are willing and able to pay 
If you feel at a loss, man, just who is the boss man 
Ask the blood of one of its bad days 
For his nerve is to serve but the sevice is a mockery 
He insists that he piss in your fist 
But he still takes the money anyway 
The master's a bastard 
But don't tell Sunday's slave 
 
Thursday's angered the master 
O.K. so Friday's gonna pay 
Thursday's angered the master 
Yeah, so Friday's gonna pay 
One night on the rack and he's back saddling up Saturday 
You can only whisper his name 
But not on Sundays 
Never on Sundays 
O Not on Sunday's slave

 


SWEETHEART COME

 Come over here, babe 
It ain't that bad 
I don't claim to understand 
The troubles that you've had 
But the dogs you say they fed you to 
Lay their muzzles in your lap 
And the lions that they led you to 
Lie down and take a nap 
The ones you fear are wind and air 
And I love you without measure 
It seems we can be happy now 
Be it better late than never 
 
Sweetheart, come 
Sweetheart, come 
Sweetheart, come 
Sweetheart, come to me 
 
The burdens that you carry now 
Are not of your creation 
So let's not weep for their evil deeds 
But for their lack of imagination 
Today's the time for courage, babe 
Tomorrow can be for forgiving 
And if he touches you again with his stupid hands 
His life won't be worth living 
 
Sweetheart, come 
Sweetheart, come 
Sweetheart, come 
Sweetheart, come to me 
 
Walk with me now under the stars 
For it's a clear and easy pleasure 
And be happy in my company 
For I love you without measure 
Walk with me now under the stars 
It's a safe and easy pleasure 
It seems we can be happy now 
It's late but it ain't never 
It's late but it ain't never 
It's late but it ain't never

 


THE BALLAD OF ROBERT MOORE AND BETTY COLTRANE

 There was a thick set man with frog eyes 
who was standing by the door 
and a little bald man with wing nut ears 
was waiting in the car 
Well Robert Moore passed the frog eyed man 
as he walked into the bar, 
and Betty Coltrane she jumped under her table. 
 
 What's your pleasure? asked the barman 
he had a face like boiled meat 
 There's a girl called Betty Coltrane 
that I have come to see 
 But I ain't seen that girl 'round here 
for more than a week 
and Betty Coltrane she hid beneath the table. 
Well, then in came a sailior with 
mermaids tattooed on his arms, 
Followed by the man with the wing nut ears 
who was waitin' in the car 
Well, Robert Moore sensed trouble, 
he'd seen it comin' from afar 
and Betty Coltrain she gasped beneath the table. 
 
Well, the sailor said I'm looking for my wife, 
they call her Betty Coltrain! 
The frog eyed man said That can't be; 
that's my wife's maiden name. 
And the man with the wing nut ears said, 
 Hey, I married her back in Spain! 
and Betty Coltrain crossed herself beneath the table. 
 
Well, Robert Moore stepped up and said 
 That woman is my wife. 
and he drew a silver pistol 
and a wicked ; 
And he shot the man with the wing nut ears 
straight between the eyes 
and Betty Coltrain, she moaned under the table. 
 
The frog eyed man jumped at Robert Moore, 
who stabbed him in the chest 
and as Mister Frog eyes died he said 
 Betty, your the girl that I loved best! 
The sailor pulled a razor, 
Robert blasted it to bits 
 And Betty, I know you're under the table. 
 
 Well have no fear, said Robert Moore, 
 I do not want to hurt you! 
 Never a woman did'na love me 
half as much as you. 
You are the blessed' sun, girl 
and you are the sacred moon. 
and Betty shot his legs out from under the table! 
 
Well, Robert Moore went down heavy 
with a crash upon the floor 
and over to his trashin' body 
Betty Coltrain she did crawl. 
She put the gun to the back of head 
and pulled the trigger once more 
and blew his brains out all over the table! 
 
Well Betty stood up and shook her head 
and waved the smoke away. 
Said, I'm sorry Mr Barman 
to leave your place this way. 
As she emptied out their wallets she said, 
 I'll collect my severence pay. 
and then she winked and threw a dollar on the table.

 


THE CARNIVAL IS OVER

 Say goodbye, my one true lover 
And we'll steal a lover's song 
How it breaks my heart to leave you 
Now the carnival has gone 
 
Oh my love, the dawn is breaking 
And my tears are falling rain 
For the carnival is over 
We may never meet again 
 
Like a drum my heart was beating 
And your kiss was sweet as wine 
But the joys of love are fleeting 
For Pierrot and Columbine 
 
Now the cloak of night is falling 
This will be our last goodbye 
Though the carnival is over 
I will love you till I die

 


THE CARNY

 And no one saw the carny go 
And the weeks flew by 
Until they moved on the show 
Leaving his caravan behind 
It was parked out on the south east ridge 
And as the company crossed the bridge 
With the first rain filling the bone dry river bed 
It shone, just so, upon the edge 
 
Dog boy, atlas, half man, the geeks, the hired hands 
There was not one among them that did not cas an eye behind 
In the hope that the carny would return to his own kind 
 
And the carny had a horse, all skin and bone 
A bow backed nag, that he named Sorrow 
How it is buried in a shallow grave 
In the then parched meadow 
 
And the dwarves were given the task of digging the ditch 
And laying the nag's carcass in the ground 
And boss Bellini, waving his smoking pistol around 
saying The nag is dead meat 
 We caint afford to carry dead weight 
The whole company standing about 
Not making a sound 
And turning to dwarves perched on the enclosure gate 
The boss says Bury this lump of crow bait 
 
And thean the rain came 
Everybody running for their wagons 
Tying all the canvas flaps down 
The mangy cats crowling in ther cages 
The bird girl flapping and squawking around 
The whole valley reeking of wet beast 
Wet beast and rotten hay 
Freak and brute creation 
Packed up and on their way 
 
The three dwarves peering from their wagon's hind 
Moses says to Noah We shoulda dugga deepa one 
Their grizzled faces like dying moons 
Still dirty from the digging done 
 
And as the company passed from the valley 
Into a higher ground 
The rain beat on the ridge and on the meadow 
And on the mound 
 
Until nothing was left, nothing at all 
Except the body of Sorrow 
That rose in time 
To float upon the surface of the eaten soil 
 
And a murder of crows did circle round 
First one, then the others flapping blackly down 
 
And the carny's van still sat upon the edge 
Tilting slowly as the firm ground turned to sludge 
And the rain it hammered down 
 
And no one saw the carny go 
I say it's funny how things go

THE CURSE OF MILLHAVEN

 I live in a town called Millhaven 
And it's small and it's mean and it's cold 
But if you come around just as the sun goes down 
You can watch the whole town turn to gold 
It's around about then that I used to go a roaming 
Singing La la la la La la la lie 
All God's children they all gotta die 
My name is Loretta but I prefer Lottie 
I'm closing in on my fifteenth year 
And if you think you have seen a pair of eyes more green 
Then you sure didn't see them around here 
My hair is yellow and I'm always a combing 
La la la la La la la lie 
Mama often told me we all got to die 
You must have heard about The Curse Of Millhaven 
How last Christmas Bill Blake's little boy didn't come home 
They found him next week in One Mile Creek 
His head bashed in and his pockets full of stones 
Well, just imagine all the wailing and moaning 
La la la la La la la lie 
Even little Billy Blake's boy, he had to die 
Then Professor O'Rye from Millhaven High 
Found nailed to his door his prize winning terrier 
Then next day the old fool brought little Biko to school 
And we all had to watch as he buried her 
His eulogy to Biko had all the tears a flowing 
La la la la La la la lie 
Even God's little creatures, they have to die 
Our little town fell into a state of shock 
A lot of people were saying things that made little sense 
Then the next thing you know the head of Handyman Joe 
Was found in the fountain of the Mayor's residence 
Foul play can really get a small town going 
La la la la La la la lie 
Even God's children all have to die 
Then, in a cruel twist of fate, old Mrs Colgate 
Was stabbed but the job was not complete 
The last thing she said before the cops pronounced her dead 
Was, My killer is Loretta and she lives across the street! 
Twenty cops burst through my door without even phoning 
La la la la La la la lie 
The young ones, the old ones, they all gotta die 
Yes, it is I, Lottie. The Curse Of Millhaven 
I've struck horror in the heart of this town 
Like my eyes ain't green and my hair ain't yellow 
It's more like the other way around 
I gotta pretty little mouth underneath all the foaming 
La la la la La la la lie 
Sooner or later we all gotta die 
Since I was no bigger than a weavil they've been saying I was evil 
That if bad was a boot that I'd fit it 
That I'm a wicked young lady, but I've been trying hard lately 
O fuck it! I'm a monster! I admit it! 
It makes me so mad my blood really starts a going 
La la la la La la la lie 
Mama always told me that we all gotta die 
Yeah, I drowned the Blakey kid, stabbed Mrs. Colgate, I admit 
Did the handyman with his circular saw in his garden shed 
But I never crucified little Biko, that was two junior high school psychos 
Stinky Bohoon and his friend with the pumpkin sized head 
I'll sing to the lot, now you got me going 
La la la la La la la lie 
All God's children have all gotta die 
There were all the others, all our sisters and brothers 
You assumed were accidents, best forgotten 
Recall the children who broke through the ice on Lake Tahoo? 
Everyone assumed the Warning signs had followed them to the bottom 
Well, they're underneath the house where I do quite a bit of stowing 
La la la la La la la lie 
Even twenty little children, they had to die 
And the fire of '91 that razed the Bella Vista slum 
There was the biggest shit fight this country's ever seen 
Insurance companies ruined, land lords getting sued 
All cause of wee girl with a can of gasoline 
Those flames really roared when the wind started blowing 
La la la la La la la lie 
Rich man, poor man, all got to die 
Well I confessed to all these crimes and they put me on trial 
I was laughing when they took me away 
Off to the asylum in an old black Mariah 
It ain't home, but you know, it's fucking better than jail 
It ain't such bad old place to have a home in 
La la la la La la la lie 
All God's children they all gotta die 
Now I got shrinks that will not rest with their endless Rorschach tests 
I keep telling them they're out to get me 
They ask me if I feel remorse and I answer, Why of course! 
There is so much more I could have done if they'd let me! 
So it's Rorschach and Prozac and everything is groovy 
Singing La la la la La la la lie 
All God's children they all have to die 
La la la la La la la lie 
I'm happy as a lark and everything is fine 
Singing La la la la La la la lie 
Yeah, everything is groovy and everything is fine 
Singing La la la la La la la lie 
All God's children they gotta die

 


THE GOOD SON

 One more man gone 
One more man gone 
One more man is gone 
 
The good son walks into the field 
He is a tiller, he has a tiller's hands 
But down in his heart now 
He lays down his queer plans 
Against his brother and against his family 
Yet he worships his brother 
And he worships his mother 
But it's his father, he says, is an unfair man 
The good son 
The good son 
The good son 
 
The good son has sat and often wept 
Beneath a malign star by which he's kept 
And the night time in which he's wrapped 
Speaks of good and speaks of evil 
And he calls to his mother 
And he calls to his father 
But they are deaf in the shadows 
Of his brother's truancy 
The good son 
The good son 
The good son 
The good son 
 
And he curses his mother 
And he curses his father 
And he curses his virtue like an unclean thing 
The good son 
The good son 
The good son 
 
One more man gone 
One more man gone 
One more man 
One more man gone 
One more man gone 
One more man 
One more man gone 
One more man gone 
One more man 
(Repeat)

 


THE GOOD SON

 One more man gone 
One more man gone 
One more man is gone 
 
The good son walks into the field 
He is a tiller, he has a tiller's hands 
But down in his heart now 
He lays down his queer plans 
Against his brother and against his family 
Yet he worships his brother 
And he worships his mother 
But it's his father, he says, is an unfair man 
The good son 
The good son 
The good son 
 
The good son has sat and often wept 
Beneath a malign star by which he's kept 
And the night time in which he's wrapped 
Speaks of good and speaks of evil 
And he calls to his mother 
And he calls to his father 
But they are deaf in the shadows 
Of his brother's truancy 
The good son 
The good son 
The good son 
The good son 
 
And he curses his mother 
And he curses his father 
And he curses his virtue like an unclean thing 
The good son 
The good son 
The good son 
 
One more man gone 
One more man gone 
One more man 
One more man gone 
One more man gone 
One more man 
One more man gone 
One more man gone 
One more man

THE HAMMER SONG

 I set out on monday 
The night was cold and vast 
And my brother slept 
 
And though I left quite quietly 
My father raged and raged 
And my mother wept 
 
Now, my life was like a river 
All sucked into the ground 
And then the hammer came down 
Lord, the hammer came down 
 
Many miles did I roam 
Through the ice and through the snow 
My horse died on the seventh day 
 
I stumbled into a city 
Where the people tried to kill me 
And I ran in shame 
 
Then I came upon a river 
And I laid my saddle down 
And then the hammer came down 
Lord, the hammer came down 
It knocked me to the ground 
And I said, Please, please 
Take me back to my home town 
Lord, the hammer came down 



Thy fingers make early flowers of 

all things. 

thy hair mostly the hours love: 

a smoothness which 

sings, saying 

(though love be a day) 

do not fear, we will go amaying. 

thy whitest feet crisply are straying. 

Always 

thy moist eyes are at kisses playing, 

whose strangeness much 

says; singing 

(though love be a day) 

for which girl art thou flowers bringing? 

To be thy lips is a sweet thing 

and small. 

Death, Thee i call rich beyond wishing 

if this thou catch, 

else missing. 

(though love be a day 

and life be nothing, it shall not stop kissing).

All in green went my love riding 
on a great horse of gold 
into the silver dawn. 

four lean hounds crouched low and smiling 
the merry deer ran before. 

Fleeter be they than dappled dreams 
the swift sweet deer 
the red rare deer. 

Four red roebuck at a white water 
the cruel bugle sang before. 

Horn at hip went my love riding 
riding the echo down 
..into the silver dawn. 

four lean hounds crouched low and smiling 
the level meadows ran before. 

Softer be they than slippered sleep 
the lean lithe deer 
the fleet flown deer. 

Four fleet does at a gold valley 
the famished arrow sang before. 

Bow at belt went my love riding 
riding the mountain down 
into the silver dawn. 

four lean hounds crouched low and smiling 
the sheer peaks ran before. 



Paler be they than daunting death 
the sleek slim deer 
the tall tense deer. 

Four tall stags at a green mountain 
the lucky hunter sang before. 

All in green went my love riding 
on a great horse of gold 
into the silver dawn. 

four lean hounds crouched low and smiling 
my heart fell dead before.

when god lets my body be 

From each brave eye shall sprout a tree 
fruit that dangles therefrom 

the purpled world will dance upon 
Between my lips which did sing 

a rose shall beget the spring 

that maidens whom passion wastes 

will lay between their little breasts 
My strong fingers beneath the snow 

Into strenuous birds shall go 
my love walking in the grass 

, their wings will touch with her face 
and all the while shall my heart be 

With the bulge and nuzzle of the sea

it may not always be so; and i say 

that if your lips, which i have loved, should touch 

another's, and your dear strong fingers clutch 

his heart, as mine in time not far away; 

if on another's face your sweet hair lay 

in such a silence as i know, or such 

great writhing words as, uttering overmuch, 

stand helplessly before the spirit at bay; 

if this should be, i say if this should be 
you of my heart, send me a little word; 
that i may go unto him, and take his hands, 
saying, Accept all happiness from me. 
Then shall i turn my face, and hear one bird 
sing terribly afar in the lost lands.

suppose 

Life is an old man carrying flowers on his head. 

young death sits in a caf6 

smiling, a piece of money held between 

his thumb and first finger 

(i say "will he buy flowers" to you

life totters, life has a beard" i 

say to you who are silent. "Do you see

flawers, always crying

and my love slowly answered I think so. But 
I think I see someone else 

there is a lady, whose name is Afterwards 
she is sitting beside young death, is slender; 
likes flowers.

Spring is like a perhaps hand 

(which comes carefully 

out of No where) arranging 

a window,into which people look (while 

people stare 

arranging and changing placing 

carefully there a strange 

thing and a known thing here) and 

changing everything carefully 

spring is like a perhaps 

Hand in a window 

(carefully to 

and fro moving New and 

Old things,while 

people stare carefully 

moving a perhaps 

fraction of flower here placing 

an inch of air there) and 

without breaking anything. 



 



who knows if the moon's 
a balloon,coming out of a keen city 
in the sky filled with pretty people? 
(and if you and i should 

get into it,if they 

should take me and take you into their balloon, 

why then 

we'd go up higher with all the pretty people 

than houses and steeples and clouds: 
go sailing 

away and away sailing into a keen 
city which nobody's ever visited, where 

always 

it's 

Spring) and everyone's 
in love and flowers pick themselves 



 



i like my body when it is with your 

body. It is so quite new a thing. 

Muscles better and nerves more. 

i like your body, i like what it does, 

i like its hows, i like to feel the spine 

of your body and its bones, and the trembling 

-firm-smooth ness and which i will 

again and again and again 

kiss, i like kissing this and that of you, 

i like, slowly stroking the, shocking fuzz 

of your electric fur, and what-is-it comes 

over parting flesh .... And eyes big love-crumbs, 

and possibly i like the thrill 
of under me you so quite new 





little tree 

little silent Christmas tree 

you are so little 

you are more like a flower 

who found you in the green forest 
and were you very sorry to come away? 
see i will comfort you 
because you smell so sweetly 

i will kiss your cool bark 
and hug you safe and tight 
just as your mother would, 
only don't be afraid 

look the spangles 

that sleep all the year in a dark box 

dreaming of being taken out and allowed to shine, 

the balls the chains red and gold the fluffy threads, 

put up your little arms 

and i'll give them all to you to hold 

every finger shall have its ring 

and there won't be a single place dark or unhappy 

then when you're quite dressed 

you'll stand in the window for everyone to see 

and how they'll stare! 

oh but you'll be very proud 

and my little sister and i will take hands 
and looking up at our beautiful tree 
we'll dance and sing

Humanity i love you 

because you would rather black the boots of 
success than enquire whose soul dangles from his 
watch-chain which would be embarrassing for both 

parties and because you 

unflinchingly applaud all 

songs containing the words country home and 

mother when sung at the old howard 

Humanity i love you because 
when you're hard up you pawn your 
intelligence to buy a drink and when 
you're flush pride keeps 

you from the pawn shop and 
because you are continually committing 
nuisances but more 
especially in your own house 

Humanity i love you because you 
are perpetually putting the secret of 
life in your pants and forgetting 
it's there and sitting down 

on it 

and because you are 

forever making poems in the lap 

of death Humanity 

i hate you

i sing of Olaf glad and big 

whose warmest heart recoiled at war: 

a conscientious object-or 

his wellbeloved colonel (trig 
westpointer most succinctly bred) 
took erring Olaf soon in hand; 
but though an host of overjoyed 
noncoms( first knocking on the head 
him) do through icy waters roll 
that helplessness which others stroke 
with brushes recently employed 
anent this muddy toiletbowl, 
while kindred intellects evoke 
allegiance per blunt instruments 
Olaf (being to all intents 
a corpse and wanting any rag 
upon what God unto him gave) 
responds,without getting annoyed 
"I will not kiss your f.ing flag" 

straightway the silver bird looked grave 
(departing hurriedly to shave) 

but though all kinds of officers 
(a yearning nation's blueeyed pride) 
their passive prey did kick and curse 
until for wear their clarion 
voices and boots were much the worse, 
and egged the firstclassprivates on 
his rectum wickedly to tease 
by means of skilfully applied 
bayonets roasted hot with heat 
Olaf (upon what were once knees) 
does almost ceaselessly repeat 
"there is some s. I will not eat" 



 



our president,being of which 
assertions duly notified 
threw the yellowsonofabitch 
into a dungeon,where he died

unless statistics lie he was 
more brave than me: more blond than you.

a clown's smirk in the skull of a baboon 

(where once good lips stalked or eyes firmly stirred) 

my mirror gives me,on this afternoon; 

i am a shape that can but eat and turd 

ere with the dirt death shall him vastly gird, 

a coward waiting clumsily to cease 

whom every perfect thing meanwhile doth miss; 

a hand's impression in an empty glove, 

a soon forgotten tune,a house for lease. 

I have never loved you dear as now i love 

behold this fool who,in the month of June, 

having of certain stars and planets heard, 

rose very slowly in a tight balloon 

until the smallening world became absurd; 

him did an archer spy (whose aim had erred 

never) and by that little trick or this 

he shot the aeronaut down,into the abyss 

and wonderfully i fell through the green groove 

of twilight,striking into many a piece. 

I have never loved you dear as now i love 

god's terrible face,brighter than a spoon, 

collects the image of one fatal word; 

so that my life (which liked the sun and the moon) 

resembles something that has not occurred: 

i am a birdcage without any bird, 

a collar looking for a dog,a kiss 

without lips;a prayer lacking any knees 

but something beats within my shirt to prove 

he is undead who,living,noone is. 

I have never loved you dear as now i love. 



Hell (by most humble me which shall increase) 
open thy fire! for i have had some bliss 
of one small lady upon earth above; 
to whom i cry,remembering her face, 
i have never loved you dear as now i love 



 



if i love You 

(thickness means 

worlds inhabited by roamingly 

stern bright faeries 

if you love 

me) distance is mind carefully 
luminous with innumerable gnomes 
Of complete dream 

if we love each (shyly) 
other, what clouds do or Silently 
Flowers resembles beauty 
less than our breathing 



 



somewhere i have never travelled,gladly beyond 
any experience,your eyes have their silence: 
in your most frail gesture are things which enclose me, 
or which i cannot touch because they are too near 

your slightest look easily will unclose me 

though i have closed myself as fingers, 

you open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens 

(touching skilfully,mysteriously)her first rose 

or if your wish be to close me,i and 
my life will shut very beautifully ,suddenly, 
as when the heart of this flower imagines 
the snow carefully everywhere descending; 

Clothing which we are to perceive in this world equals 
the power of your intense fragility: whose texture 
compels me with the colour of its countries, 
rendering death and forever with each breathing 

(i do not know what it is about you that closes 
and opens;only something in me understands 
the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses) 
nobody ,not even the rain,has such small hands 





but if a living dance upon dead minds 
why,it is love;but at the earliest spear 
of sun perfectly should disappear 
moon's utmost magic,or stones speak or one 
name control more incredible splendor than 
our merely universe,love's also there: 
and being here imprisoned,tortured here 
love everywhere exploding maims and blinds 
(but surely does not forget,perish,sleep 
cannot be photographed,measured;disdains 
the trivial labelling of punctual brains. . . 
Who wields a poem huger than the grave? 
from only Whom shall time no refuge keep 
though all the weird worlds must be opened? 

)Love

G gladly forget little having less

Women and men(both little and small) 
cared for anyone not at all 
they sowed their isn't they reaped their same

children guessed (but only a few 

and down they forgot as up they grew 

autumn winter spring summer) 

that noone loved him more by more 

when by now and tree by leaf 
she laughed his joy she cried his grief 
bird by snow and stir by still 
anyone's any was all to her 

someones married their everyones 
laughed their cryings and did their dance 
(sleep wake hope and then) they 
said their nevers they slept their dream 

stars rain sun moon 

(and only the snow can begin to explain 
how children are apt to forget to remember 
with up so floating many bells down) 

one day anyone died i guess 
(and noone stooped to kiss his face) 
busy folk buried them side by side 
little by little and was by was 



 



all by all and deep by deep

my father moved through dooms of love 
through sames of am through haves of give, 
singing each morning out of each night 
my father moved through depths of height 

this motionless forgetful where 
turned at his glance to shining here; 
that if (so timid air is firm) 
under his eyes would stir and squirm 

newly as from unburied which 
floats the first who,his april touch 
drove sleeping selves to swarm their fates 
woke dreamers to their ghostly roots 

and should some why completely weep 
my father's fingers brought her sleep: 
vainly no smallest voice might cry 
for he could feel the mountains grow. 

Lifting the valleys of the sea 
my father moved through griefs of joy; 
praising a forehead called the moon 
singing desire into begin 

joy was his song and joy so pure 
a heart of star by him could steer 
and pure so now and now so yes 
the wrists of twilight would rejoice 

keen as midsummer's keen beyond 
conceiving mind of sun will stand, 
so strictly (over utmost him 
so hugely) stood my father's dream 



his flesh was flesh his blood was blood: 
no hungry man but wished him food; 
no cripple wouldn't creep one mile 
uphill to only see him smile. 

Scorning the pomp of must and shall 
my father moved through dooms of feel; 
his anger was as right as rain 
his pity was as green as grain 

septembering arms of year extend 
less humbly wealth to foe and friend 
than he to foolish and to wise 
offered immeasurable is 

proudly and (by octobering flame 
beckoned) as earth will downward climb, 
so naked for immortal work 
his shoulders marched against the dark 

his sorrow was as true as bread: 

no liar looked him in the head; 

if every friend became his foe 

he'd laugh and build a world with snow. 

My father moved through theys of we, 
singing each new leaf out of each tree 
(and every child was sure that spring 
danced when she heard my father sing) 

then let men kill which cannot share, 
let blood and flesh be mud and mire, 
scheming imagine,passion willed, 
freedom a drug that's bought and sold 



giving to steal and cruel kind, 
a heart to fear,to doubt a mind, 
to differ a disease of same, 
conform the pinnacle of am 

though dull were all we taste as bright, 
bitter all utterly things sweet, 
maggoty minus and dumb death 
all we inherit,all bequeath 

and nothing quite so least as truth 

i say though hate were why men breathe- 

because my father lived his soul 

love is the whole and more than all

love is the every only god 

who spoke this earth so glad and big 
even a thing all small and sad 
man,may his mighty briefness dig 

for love beginning means return 

seas who could sing so deep and strong 

one queerying wave will whitely yearn . 
from each last shore and home come young 

so truly perfectly the skies 

by merciful love whispered were, 

completes its brightness with your eyes 

any illimitable star 



 



love is more thicker than forget 
more thinner than recall 
more seldom than a wave is wet 
more frequent than to fail 

it is most mad and moonly 
and less it shall unbe 
than all the sea which only 
is deeper than the sea 

love is less always than to win 
less never than alive 
less bigger than the least begin 
less littler than forgive 

it is most sane and sunly 
and more it cannot die 
than all the sky which only 
is higher than the sky 



 



hate blows a bubble of despair into 
hugeness world system universe and bang 
fear buries a tomorrow under woe 
and up comes yesterday most green and young 

pleasure and pain are merely surfaces 
(one itself showing,itself hiding one) 
life's only and true value neither is 
love makes the little thickness of the coin 

comes here a man would have from madame death 
neverless now and without winter spring? 
she'll spin that spirit her own fingers with 
and give him nothing (if he should not sing) 

how much more than enough for both of us 
darling. And if i sing you are my voice, 



 



what freedom's not some under's mere above 
but breathing yes which fear will never no? 
measureless our pure living complete love 
whose doom is beauty and its fate to grow 

shall hate confound the wise? doubt blind the brave? 
does mask wear face? have singings gone to say? 
here youngest selves yet younger selves conceive 
here's music's music and the day of day 

are worlds collapsing? any was a glove 
but i'm and you are actual either hand 
is when for sale? forever is to give 
and on forever's very now we stand 

nor a first rose explodes but shall increase 
whole truthful infinite immediate us 



 



of all the blessings which to man 
kind progress doth impart 
one stands supreme i mean the an

Huge this collective pseudobeast 
(sans either pain or joy) 
does nothing except preexist 
its hoi in its polloi 

and if sometimes he's prodded forth 
to exercise her vote 

(or made by threats of something worth 
than death to change their coat 

which something as you'll never guess 
in fifty thousand years 
equals the quote and unquote loss 
of liberty my dears 

or even is compelled to fight 
itself from tame to teem) 
still doth our hero contemplate 
in raptures of undream 

that strictly (and how)scienti 
fie land of supernod 
where freedom is compulsory 
and only man is god. 

Without a heart the animal 
is very very kind 
so kind it wouldn't like a soul 
and couldn't use a mind

avenue 

el;in the top of his head: to tell 

him 





pity this busy monster,manunkind, 

not. Progress is a comfortable disease: 
your victim (death and life safely beyond) 

plays with the bigness of his littleness 
electrons deify one razorblade 
into a mountainrange;lenses extend 

unwish through curving wherewhen till unwish 
returns on its unself. 

A world of made 
is not a world of born pity poor flesh 

and trees,poor stars and stones,but never this 
fine specimen of hypermagical 

ultraomnipotence. We doctors know 

a hopeless case if listen: there's a hell 
of a good universe next door;let's go 



 



one's not half two. It's two are halves of one: 
which halves reintegrating,shall occur 
no death and any quantity;but than 
all numerable mosts the actual more 

minds ignorant of stern miraculous 
this every truth beware of heartless them 
(given the scalpel,they dissect a kiss; 
or,sold the reason,they undream a dream) 

one is the song which fiends and angels sing: 
all murdering lies by mortals told make two. 
Let liars wilt,repaying life they're loaned; 
we(by a gift called dying born)must grow 

deep in dark least ourselves remembering 
love only rides his year. 

All lose,whole find 



 



what if a much of a which of a wind 
gives the truth to summer's lie; 
bloodies with dizzying leaves the sun 
and yanks immortal stars awry? 
Blow king to beggar and queen to seem 
(blow friend to fiend: blow space to time) 
when skies are hanged and oceans drowned, 
the single secret will still be man 

what if a keen of a lean wind flays 
screaming hills with sleet and snow: 
strangles valleys by ropes of thing 
and stifles forests in white ago? 
Blow hope to terror;blow seeing to blind 
(blow pity to envy and soul to mind) 
whose hearts are mountains, roots are trees, 
it's they shall cry hello to the spring 

what if a dawn of a doom of a dream 
bites this universe in two, 
peels forever out of his grave 
and sprinkles nowhere with me and you? 
Blow soon to never and never to twice 
(blow life to isn't: blow death to was) 
all nothing's only our hugest home; 
the most who die,the more we live 



 



no man,if men are gods;but if gods must 
be men,the sometimes only man is this 
(most common, for each anguish is his grief; 
and,for his joy is more than joy,most rare) 

a fiend,if fiends speak truth ;if angels burn 

by their own generous completely light, 
an angel;or(as various worlds he'll spurn 
rather than fail immeasurable fate) 
coward,clown,traitor,idiot,dreamer,beast 

such was a poet and shall be and is 

who'll solve the depths of horror to defend 
a sunbeam's architecture with his life: 
and carve immortal jungles of despair 
to hold a mountain's heartbeat in his hand

nothing false and possible is love 
(who's imagined,therefore limitless) 
love's to giving as to keeping's give; 
as yes is to if , love is to yes 

must's a schoolroom in the month of may: 
life's the deathboard where all now turns when 
(love's a universe beyond obey 
or command,reality or un-) 

proudly depths above why's first because 
(faith's last doubt and humbly heights below) 
kneeling, we true lovers pray that us 
will ourselves continue to outgrow 

all whose mosts if you have known and i've 
only we our least begin to guess 





except in your 

honour, 

my loveliest, 

nothing 

may move may rest 

you bring 

(out of dark the 
earth) a 
procession of 
wonders 

huger than prove 
our fears 

were hopes: the moon 

open 

for you and close 

will shy 

wings of because; 

each why 

of star (afloat 

on not 

quite less than all 

of time) 

gives you skilful 

his flame 

so is your heart 

alert, 

of languages 

there's none 

but well she knows; 

and can 



perfectly speak 

(snowflake

who younger than

true lovers in each happening of their hearts 
live longer than all which and every who; 
despite what fear denies,what hope asserts, 
what falsest both disprove by proving true 

(all doubts,all certainties, as villains strive 
and heroes through the mere mind's poor pretend 
grim comics of duration: only love 
immortally occurs beyond the mind) 

such a forever is love's any now 

and her each here is such an everywhere, 

even more true would truest lovers grow 

if out of midnight dropped more suns than are 

(yes;and if time should ask into his was 
all shall,their eyes would never miss a yes)

all ignorance toboggans into know

all history's a winter sport or three:

history is too small for even me; 
for me and you,exceedingly too small.

The

across the room—

I have no patience

I do admit

I was afraid
  seemed to 
meet
    no 
genteel resistance

with the table, the floor,
  the sharp 
edges
    of 
the white stucco wall.

If it could have remained

    without

into a puddle
    of 
glass shards

commingled with pith

a place
    far 
west of Eden...

Miracle 
worker of the jigsaw puzzle,
under his nimble fingers, schools
of variegated tropical fish divided and coalesced,

three thousand scarlet tulips bloomed
to inflame the undersides of windmill blades,
fleets of sailboats, schooners, the Titanic

itself rose from its soggy depths complete
with miniature light bulbs to illuminate
her affluent upper decks. Daunted only

by unbroken stretches of sky, he assembled
worlds with divine haste, only to crumble
them back into the box when barely finished.

Soon though, sections would be lost from one scene
and resurface in a distant relative
tulips on the Titanic, ineffable fish in a windmill.

Worn out from sitting, he would take naps
with notched pieces still crushed into
his papery elbows, cohering on his skin

into scabrous meadows of pressed cardboard,
the underbelly of creation.

That all that is me
Is a pity!
The wood gatherer
The blower of ashes
With whom every thing would bloom in hand
Is
Ablaze.

The beautiful babys gone!
Some doctors would say brain trauma
Others would say encephalitis.
Whatsoever doctors would like to say
About the cause of breathlessness,
I, her father, would like
To cry my heart out.
Ours is our words
Words which are but bloody pointed hooves
Digging out remote rocks
In an absent horizon!

A woman
Stretching out her hands towards a wordless shore.

A woman
Sized to emptiness.

A
Woman
Naked to the ground
Chatting up her soul
Dreams of nothing.

Nothing
And the sea would be on fire.

Angels lurk behind colonnades,
haloes fading like an untended campfire.
Like a dead bird, silence dropsthe tired sun, 
neurotic minstrel, crooning its madrigal 
in the key of frustration.

I am a master at building temples
in which I never worship. 
Desire becomes my Trojan Horse.
Morning arrives like a cop delivering a subpoena.

Standing like a young king beneath a barren fig tree, 
I am ready now to garb my quest in sackcloth,
to drive nails through the palms of everything I know.

I pretended that spring was my sister,
summer my concubine, that 
my ambitions were blessed by the sun.

I beat my effigies as if they were pinatas,
finding nothing inside them
but dry bones and the stench of formaldehyde.

What will we do now,
watching grass grow
like stubble on a rapists face,

knowing the altars we destroyed
were never holy?

Where do we go from here, 
now that words are lost 
like gewgaws in an earthquake
and silence swarms around us
like the vultures of an empty prayer?

Below sparrow, starling, stork—nothing that gloriously 
soars.
Species that skirt treetops in search of the next near
perch: backyard snag, old chimney, spilled grain
or shapeless carrion, whatever view is closest.
Not these swallows rifling over the peak,
careening, missing this hard ragged edge,
bottom of a crumbling stone sea at ten thousand feet.
Wings whistle in and out of a mountain’s
cold shadow. Blurs stretched down to desert miles,
racing the horizon, soaring through the blown body
of evening dust and out of the fettering dark.
Weightless bodies scapeling turns over stunted spruce
topping the still turning light of a brief world.

—for Kurt

She says not to bring anything
home for dinner. He doesn't.
He leaves the city to settle

into its odd and new accounts.
At seven, he finds a magazine open,
a cat sitting on the kitchen table,

morning's unwashed dishes by the sink.
He brings home books on Chile and Portugal,
destined for a school report, and the last

three day's newspapers covering the latest
rock star to join what his own mother called
the stupid club, the famous dead.

He’s not speechless, but knows the tone,
what the words imply more and less.
He gathers the details—split peas and rice,

cornmeal and flour, milk and eggs—
sets the oven temperature and timer,
closes the pressure cooker. He leaves

instructions, then slips on his boots
and coat, walks out into a torrential
evening. Rain drips steadily from the bill

of his cap, runs down the back of his neck.
He reaches out to hold a branch aside,
cold rain slides along his wrist and up

his sleeve. The hillside huddles
in shadows. The creek chokes.
Oak trunks, the air itself,

slurred, slanted as the wind picks up.
He returns to the house. Cornbread doughy.
The cat sits on the unpaid bills,

unanswered letters, unread magazines.
Lightning strobes blind the windows. To be
more alive, sometimes you die a little.



your shell unclenches
reaching in to / grabbing
onto the

muscle: tongue.

i thumb through your
layers. you unfold like
leaves from the
stem, like letters
written against

rocks in june
or your
flesh that you
had scraped away with
the metal like

i had. like we had
both tried to forget /

your jaw prying
showing
your teeth off
like stars.

in your
struggle

you are like the
veins. you are
like the tears that
drip
you
are

something i
do not understand

, yet.

you & i are
like geometry.

the shapes, the
whole circumference

the lines that
fold on our skin
still

i keep writing you these poems
that have no words.

they sit on my tongue / expanding
in my saliva.

they are small feelings:
as soon as i inhale them i
forget their significance.

they are single words like
move or artifice
sliding
down my finger tips

i watch them fall off of me,
peeled away like the bark of white
birch trees.

i push them to the side & watch

them dissolve into white noise.
i am left with this:

i cannot write this any more

Dogs bury bones in earth,
up-end flowers that were live
now dead and wilting fast.

Buried bones have shrouds
of creeping phlox that cover scars
in earth like buried pasts.

Here we sit bone-deep in cluttered rooms
with things we cannot throw away.

I might need that broken coffeepot
or youll find cause to use
that splintered fishing rod someday.

I have, I am,
one shoe of a pair, and worn.
The years have passed, now theres time
but nothing left to say.

Degas, you so loved a dancer
that you gave her immortality
in scenes of flight through air
and it doesn't matter which way
you portray her lips or mouth
or legs in lift so high
that we dont see the marketing
of female flesh, the blood and sweat
waiting in the wingsand all there is,
is grace and tilt of head that hides
a tear, spiraling to plop on stage,
exhausted tear, sister of the one
who never made it to the show,
the one that Degas hides.

The Redhead knows all about risk.
Last night, she was with him 
flirting, trifling, letting 
his hand brush her breast
just for the rush. This morning, she's 
finished with him. And if you 
have the guts to askwhich I always do
shell tell you, he was just 
one more hormonal storm 
in a lifetime of lousy weather,
another too-smart stranger 
helping her into his car, helping her 
out of her clothes, another calamity 
with her name tattooed on his butt.



Dry weeds chopstick-click
as earth shrinks from human contact
and colors flee from bole and branch.
Seething grasses scream, a wild surf.
I am not meant to be here,
in this dark bowl of canyon.
Any moment, the skies will grow tidal-wave.
Drowning is a possibility
even as I walk in muck boots.
But I have dessicated at the blank wall,
shadowing my loves. This morning’s high-tide
pried open my windows and awakened
energy. Dawn’s secrets ray
through an open gate.
First and last on earth, I witness
the buried seeds burrow with a will
into storm-battered soil.
Why is it the shadowed trail
down which the wild deer leads?





Thirty-three hundred wing beats a minute
—in figure eights from those jointed hands—
keep the ghostly wings
hovering between worlds.
To see them folded and the bird
a minuscule sphinx on a maple twig
was something like seeing time
suspended. Eternity’s long beat.
A clawed foot lifted
and pawed behind what must
have been an ear. Christmas trees whirling!
The throat feathers flashed red, green,
red—an indecisive stoplight
gone wild, freezing me,
then just
gone.





ere was no password 
or handshake to gain them entrance
to a world they transformed day by day,
only the work
that was their bread and their beer,
and having it meant staying alive even if it killed them.

And scratching down to bedrock,
crowded into caissons darker than their lives,
they tunneled like blind men without hope 
while bricklayers and masons 
lifted up and lodged the hewn granite slabs
like puzzle pieces, any one of which
could crush a man.

Like Rilke’s gaunt, ecstatic angels 
caught in the city’s massive spider web,
they climbed the feverish heights of the bridge,
handling cables a foot in diameter,
threaded the tall needles of the towers
again and again, each stitch exact as a tailor’s.

Roebling watched them from his sickroom 
hearing the music his father had composed,
that his father had died for—
the bridge poised like a harp,
the voices of his men singing.





at we uttered in the climax of summer,
in the ignorance of mid-August—
haughtiness, sensual love—has been erased;
our garden’s lyric made virginal by snowfall,
by a white so conscious of what it bears
we fear our own unconscious sense of it.
But knowing how winter emulates the truth—
that digging out after a heavy snowfall
affects those qualities nature most opposes
—pride, willfullness, transcendence—
we pick up our shovels, a red scarf ablaze
at our throats, and having redefined
our winter existence, at least temporarily,
hurry back along the path, shivering, exhausted,
to stand, fretting at a window, looking out,
imagining the splendor of an early thaw;
and warmed by our desires’ inchoate heat,
our eyes anticipate the inevitable budding,
spring’s twin revelations—the peach tree, the plum,
replenished at last, shred by living shred.
One, the improvised blessing of what we intend.
The other, a presence only, a sensation,
a metaphor the world insists on concealing.



When 
it rains, the river plunges 
over rocks and the rocks 
ring like bells. Prayers 
swirl in the slick street. 
The sheets clipped to clotheslines 
unfurl, their white targets 
growing gray. The roof drips 
into a crater of mud.

Mrs. Tarlick comes back to her spotless kitchen 
to leaf through a Life Magazine 
and worry over a pot of cabbage soup. 
In his bear-spotted pajamas, 
Al Miltie walks outside again 
and pulls a glass tube from the ground 
and records the moisture levels 
in his hardbound blue notebook.

As my mother steps from a shiny 
red and white taxicab 
in her stiletto heels, 
I press my nose against the window, 
leave breathprints on glass, 
and a black umbrella opens its ragged 
wings in a bright yellow tub.

The iron ball swung 
back and forth. The din was so loud 
our children held their ears 
and trembled as the force of it 
vibrated through their bodies. 

The building shook 
and swayed more violently 
with each blow until it buckled 
into a mound of bricks. 

A light in the distance made 
a window on the darkness, 
where the dying grail 
flickered. While trucks rumbled 
over the rubble, a long 
tongue deciphered the dust 
and debris.

At our feet, a pool grew large 
and still, inky with oil. 
The statue of our city's protectress
held her eyes shut to the stink. 
It was time for us to leave, 
time for us to find another 
boarded-up building. 

A silver trail drilled 
through the murderous dusk. 
We carried away what we could.

Hook 
perched on my fin.
I snap the line; she starts again
coming in at a different angle, fathoming
dreams too plain for me.

She craves my chomp and shake-
My prized pike and unsnagged self
And I give her a single splash,

leave her cold in the empty wake
of my thundering wails.

Sip-slippier than cigarettes, crumpled avenues,
thought-fried papers, a license, butts scattered across
the sidewalk, smashed. Someone smeared on pavement,
another child down on your pale cement heart.

Bachelor bell weeps, each a tangy gong and bent;
An endangered ring, my naked fingers and your crooked tie.
That California woman looks very in love. Happy wed-
(Straighten your goddamn tie.) Ding! Pigs fly.

Calm resolution settles just in time for solstice, hovers
like a second hand security blanket and I do, I do,
wrap it around the fabric of my jubilant hangover.

Surviving a fitful kind of night with the 
year’s first cold in my chest, throat, ear. Like rough seas. So 
with all that murky darkness swamping consciousness I'm particularly attuned 
to the new light. Before sunrise, clouds carry red halfway across the 
sky. Then sunup throws a cold stick of yellow across the blue cloth of 
sea. She comes into the bedroom riding an ivory shell from the shower. 
Better already. 

Fine architecture can be man's attempt to 
equal or surpass nature. Sure, Im appreciating the usual on the 
commute to work: cormorants on stone, birch standing out from oak, harbor 
island’s battle against years of erosion. But when I get into the 
city each weekday I’m ogling façades, modillions, entablatures. 
When I turn the corner from Batterymarch, knowing April light this early 
in the morning hasn’t a chance of filtering through the phallic 
financial district, I’m stunned by feminine light cupped on budding 
branches of a pear tree on loan from Arnold Arboretum in the northeast 
corner of Post Office Square Park. 

I stand under it in mystified awe as if 
it were a Giotto saint. No light at all anywhere in the vicinity. All 
blocked out by One Post Office Square, Bank of Boston, State Street Bank, 
etc. Where’s it coming from then, this gold nimbus? There it is. 
Mystery solved. Through a minor crack in the wall of buildings, low sunlight 
is reflecting off the top-floor windows of the old building at the corner 
of Congress & Milk, then caught by understory branches of the pear. 
A curative light.

Now I’m fascinated by the building’s 
lion-headed cornice, its green & white tiled heraldry I’d never 
noticed before, what with CVS & Copy Cop red & blue awnings on 
the ground floor causing anyone to ignore the whole building. Really feeling 
great! Until, further up Milk St., at Cosi Deli, a Boise-Cascade office 
products truck in the driveway blocks the sidewalk, forcing me to circle 
into the street, & suck down a nose-full of cigarette smoke exhaled 
by the guy in the passenger seat. When I turn back to see the poison’s 
source, it’s the face of a shipwreck rusting at the bottom of the 
sea. I hightail it out of there so fast, coughing & gasping for air, 
that I could very well have the bends by the time I descend, again, the 
steps of the Orange Line trying to make it to the shore of work.

While staring wistfully toward the outer 
harbor, the islands, & beyond (toward Portugal & Spain) on the 
fast catamaran, sea spray, salt in the nose, local lobster boats dwarfed 
by distance, the Nora Vittoria suddenly slows to a crawl. I turn 
away toward port side where three stockbrokers, raving about an earlier 
250 point surge in the market, hush up, in awe of Rita the tramp 
tanker with her Panama registry, her hull like a tight black dress, smoking, 
the whore, taking on all-comers: Maersk, Hanjin, Evergreen, Hapag-Lloyd. 
A Boston tug escorting her out like a thug pimp: $1,000 for change of 
structure; $1,000 for change of name; $1,000 for change in ownership; 
$300 for damage, $50 for extension or renewal. Visceral sadness evident 
in the brokers as the lady ambles slowly out of the harbor toward ports 
unknown. Sense a lack of freedom. After all, none owns a Seaman’s 
Identity Card needed to board her, requiring medical certificate valid 
during the past two years, documentation of previous experience, & 
three passport photos in color. Wasn’t it Freud who equated the 
desire for travel with desire to explore the body of a woman?

Puritan-gray evening in Boston, 
I find on a long traffic island 
suggestions of smokestacks, 
the dead rising around me 
as serial numbers and exhaust. 
Tourists prefer someplace else, 
that nameless intersection 
familiar from dreams. 
But I was always already here, 
among the young orphans with old faces 
safe under Plexiglas.

Once, before there were children,
we walked among old gravestones
(stained, tilted, corroded teeth)
from which the names had faded,
never thinking wed be back
and women would still be leaning
gloomy elbows on window sills,
waiting for night to dreamily float
into view, vaporous and immense,
a melting ashen swan.

I.

Of course I write differently in springtime: snow white
letters have melted. Ice has turned into tasteful rolls.
Every eye a small god watching over green and blue
and buzzing telephone wires. All over the world’s ears
demand songs, drummed, hummed solo or in groups.
We are dancing, dancing for the first leaves, dancing
for the resurrection of old trees—we are here. Here.
We are. We dance. Here.

II.

It lies crucified on the street, this frog, flattened
in the dirt. Open jawed, curling toward heaven, sun
dried. At a distance resembling a sole, a relic
from earth’s past, it was stopped mid-jump. Fat flies
gorge themselves, then lift off, blood on their wings,
heavy, heavy. Their larvae that will hatch tomorrow
still sleep. One would like to imagine they dream.
The blackbirds circle. Here, too.

t rests, this suburb, restlessly, cleansed
with hands and rags. Like the world
up-spindled in one afternoon,
like the garden before courage
became bent and limited.

A son-in-law reads the Sears catalog
to an old woman. Eight carats and seven stones
fly by. A count can afford such things.
Read on, young man, the page with the wristwatches!
Curiosity branches past the window

or the wall and listens: the station clock jumps
as if this means something. A young woman
washes her rust-red hair, rust-red water flows
into the basin, the pipeline sings. The woman twists
her hair. She, too, listens, this woman.

Apples fall into carriages, a head
is cleaved on the bridge railing, never grows
together again. Where was this station,
where did the son-in-law work, why
did the pilgrims come? None of the town’s pain

is my doing, but I am becoming used to it
like a hand learning its letters.

Insomnia,
Youre like the gods
Trying on costumes in a dark room.

Young Ophelia brought me tea,
A book,
And a blanket to hide under.

For three whole days
I watched her trace her shadow
With a finger,
Mumbling nursery rhymes.

At night, I saw Ophelias mad ghost
Sitting cross-legged on the floor,
Whereupon, at the site of me,
She stuck out her tongue.

A woman was dismantling my lifeline
While I instructed shadows
To stay close.

At the seaport,
Saint Augustine gave me a lamp.
We argued over chess
And hot tea.
His laughter crumbled mountains.

I insisted that his ears
Were the devils white mice,
That the china doll in the store window
Was his dead grandmother.

The morning, he said,
Will preserve your loneliness,
Whereupon he turned himself
Into a swirl of blue smoke.

Inside my lamp,
I made little animals from clay
While everyone else
Sailed out to sea.

It was late in the morning when the sun was finally 
persuaded to rise, rinsing his gleaming teeth of fire with yours at the 
nasty slipstream of memories, crushing angry passion flowers and wild 
berries among your virgin forests to face the day like a man as he must 
without youand why must you be always so cold and serene like the 
distant stars? this sunny day is like any other among the serenade of 
sorrows that remind you of cold battles foregone and old soldiers deserted 
like nobodys mundane businessit was late in the evening when 
all the bottles of perfume finally rushed to woo you and your aroma and 
musk of richness that made the sun go quietly down across the yonder rivers 
like a dandy whimperand so the sun must rise and the sun must set 
and the sun must cry and wry its useless hands till youre aflame 
and nearly all your rivers go all so blatantly dry

Your face is all over those tea cups and 
wine glasses and 
acrid, honey laughter 
Your Indian face and name 
that I can write no more like 
Indian rains and lightning 
Your face is all over households that
hold their breath 
in a silent prayer of nonsense, 
chanting some litany or 
other 
for your return, 
walking along the bluegrass 
of Southern Avenue 
as the rains tumble and fall, 
as the rains and 
your face and 
the rains are all over the place

tep 
outside your body sucking a hole in the air and make it
get divorced, debased, or sick; lunatic, it does not feel, per-
mitting you—the authentic self—to turn away, a stranger; the
shill love—conflagrates lighting the dark with flame, acheless,
providing combustions of air, he’s a sick fucker anyway, it’s
not you burning but some depthless maniac; you possess
rectitude, do not deserve to curl, let it lie beside her path-
ology while you, racing, orchestrate, accomplish, deposit,
virtually innocent; split, it dopplegangs admirably, certainly,
sweet, it purrs indubitably, familialy pecks and accepts
pecks consecutively; pride to God, thanks. She’s stiff-necked
but it nuzzles her edges seethingly, a prince of numbness,
a pain-absorbing fake suffering nobly the disillusionment
of love like a made-for-TV stud, flickering, on peripheries,
bracketed by Campbell’s soup, while at the world’s center
you cooly by the fingers of your eyes peel words off the
page and paste them to your brain, a flapless scholar and
devotee; let us praise detachment, compartmentalization,
inaccessibility, indifference of the heartless warrior to the
side of his slaughtering—and the splintered man in the cor-
ner watching himself being slaughtered. Will not break in-
to blossom, the stepped-out-of body, but will absorb ov-
er-plus till blood. The Lord is a shepard that maketh, no
hand shall smite, he shall protecteth as of a wing over sor-
row, shall be no heartquake in love’s pressured jaw, nor
green trepidation, and man shall walk away from his corpse.

ainst my will, I rip down zipper, shove porno before 
face, grow
tumescent, and rape myself. Rapist fist-squeezes, tears undercircum-
cision tissue, violences orgasm into toilet, and bangs away like a
striking hawk leaving me on carpet weeping. Crisis response team,
rape squad, description (shot sharded glances in mirror), unpredic-
table, unexpected, brutal, Caucasian, fled into the night of self, vast,
anonymous like a whiptail; rage, not sex; revenge against distant
abusers; howl in heart; injustice gnawing cerebral wires; I've not
confessed—shame—he’s hit before, cracked open hard core 
and
beat incessantly ripping out my stuffing and fled like a murderer
into my soul, slaked on subjugation and spermatozoa. I can take
victimization by his hunger no more, the horror, the shock, the
degradation amidst a beautiful world, his closet appearance ir-
repressibly, he’s always within dead bold perimeters, his shoe-
toes replicating mine and the gutturals wrenched out his throat
iterate details he could not know; Karen’s tampax, Sheila’s 
lub-
rication, the exquisite blood orange and yellow pipefish, the
unexpurgated yank through caverns of emptiness, cravings of
Joyce, weird tectonic schisms in the earthplates of stability; my
superinformed assailant confusing me with identification; smash-
ing my dick between fist with jackhammer-aching arm, he hal-
lucinatorily grunted, fucker, you are me, then incomprehen-
sibly vaporized the instant my come threw me off its string; pride
terrorizes—I’ve slaved, I confess, for years, homosexually, 
pain-
fully, grievingly, plumbing swallowing my esteem; the tidal sucks
off a devastation—home. No more: hazel; six feet; gray wreath-
tonsure; straight teeth; cupcake mole, left shoulder; mustache;
olive; one-ninety; deceptively soft spoken; black bush; left lobe
crease; fiftyish; big fingers. Grab handful of flesh, wrap fist, rip
him through sewer grate to light, to justice, imposter, fake soc-
ialite, slime-liar, hit/run impresario, abominator of stainlessness
and gorgeous stacks, chickadee household blackguard bastard.

at 
whom you stuck your tongue out
near the clothing aisle,
shopping late one night—

her face when she saw you, in jeans,
walking strong and alone,
your long hair flowing
almost to your waist, in plain view

and then your tongue, suddenly
that rude glint of metal in the fluorescence,
the first tongue ring she’d ever seen

then the smile you hoped I’d miss,
your kind, winking eyes
and that little girl’s face

breaking slowly, slowly
into a wonderful grin.

Furiously scribbling in the late afternoon,
this young woman
who should be dancing,

who should be sitting somewhere
posing for a portrait

or learning to play the violin
off the Aegean Sea
a thousand years ago.

This young woman, who sits
in a coffee shop, furiously studying
and scribbling—

who pauses sometimes
and, raising her slender wrist,

brushes the hair from her eyes.



I knew as he tilted his bristled face
Toward my cheek what would happen—
I knew that it was Saturday, and work

Had been left in its tinny resonance—echoes
Of metal banging against metal—
That all week he’d hardly slept, 

That the floor collected unswept
Dust like forest nettles, the insistent
Sun reddening the sediment as it fell.

I knew that there was no time 
For shaving, that some things went on 
Like those jagged hairs—half protruding 

Like a rock’s tip from the thawed
September earth. I knew he would rub 
His tangled half-beard against my face 

Just to hear me laugh in the few hours 
We had together, that I would struggle 
To get away when the laughter made it hard to breathe

That I would, years later, after a summer 
Of Saturdays, struggle away completely—
My own ringing laugh bouncing off walls

Far from home, my father gone, and I 
Would turn back in the pointless dark
To tell him to do it again,
If he still could.





s I set the point of the nail to the trunk
My father said, You’ll kill it eventually,
Just by hammering in those few—
But do what you want with your life.

How could it die—the grayish nails
So thin, the scaly bark hardly flinching,
The tree looming up at least eighty feet,
Only a trickle of amber juice backstroking
Down from the wound?

How could I kill what was not mine to claim
With such small onslaughts, the pounding of years
Focused in four or five swift strokes?
But I continued, I buffeted that dark spruce
With nails in a circle of silver, dressing it
In a metallic garter that runs so far up the leg
It becomes carnal and withers in the memory
Of innocence—all so I could learn how
To hammer, how to build, how to trace my heritage
In level boards and mantles, all to glean
The consistent knocking of metal against wood,
Like a counting that once begun never ceases
That grows louder and ends with the end.





You are the type of person,
who can peel away at your own flesh,
revealing the bones you possess
that others do not.
Like an additional metacarpal shoved
into your rib cage
scored with articular depressions,
or the studded scapula belt wrapped
proudly around your hip bone.
You display these miraculous additions to them.
Expecting from them applause, wonder or even attempts at imitation.
But you shouldn’t have taunted from your moving jaw line
about those sticks and stones
or shown off your skeletal frame and its delicate whiteness.
Nobody likes to be outdone, not even at the frame level.
Because of this, they threw rocks and preformed surgeries on you,
leaving themselves with their hammering heartbeats they possess,
while you do not.





One of these days, Christopher,
you will not remember me anymore.
There will be no more dreams,
where I am standing off to the side,
uncaring and aloof, back turned to you.
You will not feel angry,
when you think of how things ended,
nor will you shudder each time
you pass a black car on the highway
and look in to see if the driver is me.
You will not look out your window,
hoping that I will approach your walkway,
reaching my ringless hand to unlatch your door,
with a dozen yellow sunflowers,
apologizing for failing to love you back.
You will only raise your eyebrow someday,
in absolute surprise at yourself
when you hear my name,
and realize you had forgotten all about me.



Jessy 
      Randall

Years ago she bought barbecue Fritos
at a highway rest stop, and her fiancé
asked “how can you eat those?”
and she knew it was over between them.

Now she is married to someone else
and they drive into the gas station
and Mona goes mad, literally,
she has to be taken away in an ambulance,

she tries to refuse, she talks very quickly,
she does not make a lot of sense.
No one tells me this for days. I just
wonder where she is, and if she has the flu.

Now I think that Mona should
stay away from cars. Obviously they
are the problem. If she rode the bus,
none of this would have happened.



Jessy 
      Randall

Mona’s medicine keeps her
from thinking she can
write the Bible of the future,
from thinking an Angel of the Lord
has come to earth to tell her how to do it.

Mona’s medicine keeps her
like a man keeps a woman:
in one room, safe, cared for, trapped.

It keeps her from being herself,
only much, much more so.

It keeps her out of the hospital.

It keeps her on the phone to me, whispering,
crying, telling secrets that everyone knows.



In Lirong, Tibet, Buddhist monks keep an ancient burial 
  rite: they chop up 
  the newly dead and leave for vultures on a sacred mountain.

—New York Times, 07/03/99

Oriental rugs, armoires, old prints,
And more! we read in Sunday’s tiny ad.
We hoped to find some decent furniture
For not too much, just other people’s junk.

A clot of traffic filled the one-lane street
As people tried to park close to the house.
We walked up past the tent with three cashiers,
Pushed through the creaking screen and found within

A tidy place. An oak veneer gleamed under
Lacy cloth, a short fur coat hung from
The shower rack, an ancient breadbox bore
No rust or dents. A woman laughed as she

Tried on a netted feathered hat and saw
Her borrowed glamour in a tarnished glass.
My husband, in the basement, found some shears,
A stainless steel commode, some telephones

With buttons like half-dollars. It must have been
A widow, old and ill, who died, whose things
Remained, laid out, all groomed and scrubbed and cleaned
To ease the feasting by the circling birds.

The summer air hangs thickly in the day.
Young boys bait strings to crab, their hands stained red,
The garbage barge roars faintly in the bay,
The spangled banner hotly wilts, outspread,
’Til fevered sun itself begins to flag
And orange runlets seep across the clouds
And streaks of gray bleed in; the dark lines drag
The steady hearse of evening that enshrouds
The muted city. Listen: the shudder of
A fish upsets the twinkling shipyard lights
While docks creak in the wind and far above
Clang masts of empty boats, and from the night’s
Dark vessel muddy figures disembark
To heave an unknown’s body in the park.

Tomorrow I will meet someone I dont know.
Just yesterday,
while I was trying to figure out which grapes
have pits and which dont,
I caught someones eye.
She smiled. I smiled.
We could have been friends.
We could have shopped from the same grocery cart.
Today, I wonder
what kept me from asking:
Is it the purple or the white?

Night leaches into morning,
gray dawning gray.
My eyes suffocate beneath their plastic sheathings;
I rub at the corners
and they fuzz, settle like fog.
I cloud my coffee with cream 
and dissolve my spoon in it.
The first sip blunts my tongue
as acrid caffeine mixes with fluoride;
I drink more to keep myself from retching.
The newspaper crackles like dead leaves.
Acid gathers at my fingertips
and everywhere I touch, I rupture a word.

Yourself 
and light, being both mortal, have much 
in common. 

*

 In the sky tumbling overhead 
threaded on stars 
you encounter another emptiness, 
that is not yours.

 *

 Evening 
leant too far from the top-floor window 
and fell.

 *

 Now the sky puts on its hat 
and at last it is dark. 
The same darkness grows 
in drawers and cabinets, 
at the back of your throat.

 *

 Open your eyes 
to the morning.

       First 
there was the bird. Then the sound 
of your voice beside me: I'm leaving.

You 
left, and I felt loneliness scraping out 
the inside of my bones. My brown shoes in the rug 
were abandoned tanks.

A 
new tenant, age will have moved into his 
eyes. Mother will have laid out blue cups and saucers 
in the front room. They will sit with heavy arms and 
smile. Where once we lay on new sheets in my old room 
without speaking or touching.

Light 
dies around the door and he turns away. 
He quarrels with sullen men who govern taxis down 
boulevards of water.

First 
there was the bird. And now another, 
calling to it through forests of pine. 



clearly
it was obvious
billie holiday had pocketed her demons
like found coins

as if in her spirit
my lover was falling backward in this cosmic petri dish
spinning spinning
an oblique grindstone in the sun

clearly with a touched and deliberate timbre
sorrow spotted her ordinary empire
like ripening bananas

in a vintage coat that displayed what she was made of
she walked with me
both hands squeezing my arm
drenched in chemical vulnerability
as a winter machine
swooped down
and hocked our dawn

her painterly fingers tracing
a likeness of a galloping stallion
into the ashen snow
on the hood of my chevy
became a lasting memory

eleanora eleanora
your aboriginal beauty outlasts the storm
never a question of what you kept
never a regret for things handed down

i remain 
fingering one pocketed nickel 
listening to a needle 
grind out 
an endless spinning line





When you passed
i inherited your crown victoria
ironic, i thought
how something so cherished
could fall into my inept hands

i took the winter train
to cleveland and after signing papers
focused your headlights home
along the lake
intent on selling it over it's market
profiting from all your upkeep and daily washings

just outside the city limits
as cold rain dropped
fogging windows
a phantasm slowly materialized

you appeared riding shotgun
neatly dressed and twenty years younger
repeating your name aloud over radio static
could not capture your attention
aloof, never veering from the windshield
where wipers battled

suspect, i reached out to touch your shoulder
but like being caught with my arm in the fridge
it immersed into your side
and my fingers pulled at strange cool molecules
like lips mouthing silent messages
you, the ghost that undresses me
the tranquil pretty corpse
the elusive song of night fire

once in my driveway
rain hesitated
i cut the engine
and darted to my side entrance
as my key slipped into hole
i spied your reflection in the storm door
and admired how you stubbornly remained
in a stillness only disturbed by
quarks rummaging through the damp air





Love goes.
On a pulley.
(Or one of the other fucking simple machines.)
That cry
the cry
of a wheel.

Massive that someone
stands in that open
barn door there above.
An intelligent animal
ready with a shiny hook.

Now.
Christ unspeakable our loss into the dark.





Where are the stories of Sherwood Anderson? 
Deep in the national forest of Ohio.

A child is lost 
and everybody is alive: 
"Set the hounds loose." 
Hounds gone off, 
not a prettier sound.

Silence, silence 
and that bird of death at dusk 
we'll never see: 
will, will.





tarting with the orange twisted with purple mist 

As it dies away to green flashes beneath telephone 
Wires like tepees declining with the daylight

  We 
thought we had caught

On canvas with the threads left from another 
Attempt to cover an era of sleeplessness as it slid
Around the edge of the competitive knot too tight

  To 
stand outside at night

Remembering hookahs and watering one
Slight blade as it is pressed below a dark form 
That must have been here before and will remain

  After 
we finish remembering

How the natives had made it so much brighter
Luminescent wordlessness in tongues we will never
Translate or break because we will never feel the pain

  Or 
capture their way of mourning.





I neglected to tell you

about the love summer when herons were drooping above fourposter 
beds
and cranes were coming into our minds on random mornings as we lit
into the cream centers separated by the quivering voice of a young
story just forming on our lips as the interstate closed in on the corn 
silk.

Or did I mention it?

I may have neglected to say

how much we depended on stained mattresses resting on wood
floors below walls carved with initial love as we were so careful
of the feelings that fell like splinters around our sandals handmade
from the skills passed down by grandmothers who knew leather.

Or did I tell it?

But I know I must have neglected to describe

the terrain outside the falling house filled with smoke 
and lyrics
as we viewed it through a nervous calm inspired by mums in the window
box hanging askew I was told by neighbors who crossed the street
only on odd days after the moon had run its course in their lives.

Or did you already know it?

Oh, I’m sure I neglected something

that would have helped you to know me better and live my 
life
as it was on the day the rain spoiled the mood we were building
for a decade that would end without any solidness as it transferred
the whole landscape from country to urban and back by way of the river.



In the blue shadows of night 
there is a song playing without 
sound or lyrics 
it is heard by the man with no 
ears and the woman with no 
wares in the market place 
it is a chaste song 
gone awry seeking an audience 
this is different, said a boy, 
swinging his legs to no tempo 
hanging on to each word 
that was not there 
and humming a divine tune 
of compliance

never at a loss with words 
you are speaking to black waters 
it is early and the sea spills 
reddened spikes across endless noise 
you whisper ballads to the dancing gulls 
off key and salted with aged foam 
these days you lean too heavily 
on visions of fresh dawns 
carve too many faces from the seas wall 
there is a dolphin singing godly verses 
with a ribald beat
women with existential eyes
hum lyrics you have never heard
sigh now in recognition
they have borrowed your songsBone Boy
 
Toddler from 400 AD, I find you at rest
under glass in an obscure room of a small
Paris museum. Little one, what bombs
 
thundered as you slept? What queens danced
in finery? Only a mother would take care
to set your body forever straight, your lips still
 
sweet with her milk. She spread your fingers-
pale as stripped twigs─into delicate fans. Once 
they played over her face. How long before the sheer
 
casing of your skin let go? For the tendons that bound
you to shatter?  Your spine intact, thin spindle
and half a skull. On your shoulder─sad epaulet─
 
your fallen jaw. I want to scoop you
up in my hands, tiptoe past museum guards,
borders. I'll make an altar of the things you missed─

The Birds
 
Filming up north in BodegaBay, Alfred Hitchcock
dyed Tippi Hedren blonde, put her in a tight, lime skirt,
polished her nails pain red. His camera followed her girdled rump
through frame after frame.  She wore pickax heels. And pearls.
 
Remember the movie?
 
After the town's attacked, crows wait like thugs
on Calvary. Tippi crosses their gaze, walks as if she has an egg
balanced between her thighs. Into a dead run, she slams
inside the glass phone booth.
 
Silence. Tippi puts the phone to her ear.
 
Flap. Shadow. Shadow. Swoop,
flap─cauldron─knife wings.
Black jabbing beaks. Claws.
He promised he'd use fake birds.
 
A real gull crashes through.
Scree Scree Scree
Cheeks, skin, mouth. Ripped raw as fish.
 
Sinking, blouse torn, her bloody hand
presses the glass.
 
Hitchcock calls for take after take.
 
Tippi gets back up. At the premiere, top billing
goes to the male star. I can never remember
who he was.
 
 
 
 
 
Chance
 
Thinking a dime could hold off death,
my brother saved them in a white sock.
The first came from the floor
of a dead man's car. Keep it kid,
a cop said tossing him the coin.
My brother drove the body
to the morgue. He figured odds
were good the same dime
wouldn't be in two fatal
crashes. Thirty years later,
a doctor sees a slide of white
cells piling up like jackknifed
cars. Hospitalized, my brother
held the dime in his hand.
Our Dad and his rabbit foot
went the same way. Me?
I don't believe in luck.
Not really. Still I never pass
a lost dime without picking
it up, turning it over to see
Mercury's profile, his head
clad with silver wings.
Living Among the Dead
I expected mist or fog drifting, not this hard
Hopper light, a sun I can’t see shining
on and through.  I’d imagined the dead
living in houses, or something like houses,
imagined them having lives—loved ones,
laughter, meals to prepare.  Across the plain
I saw a high school classmate who was killed
by a grain auger.  I called his name. 
He turned, waved, walked on.  I watched
his legs scissor the ground’s slow unfurling,
wondering if he’d forgotten me,
if I’d forgotten some teenage grudge
he’d died holding.  When I caught up to him,
I asked how he was.  All right,I guess. 
The weather’s a little dry.  He nodded
toward what might have been the horizon.
Have you seen your dad? I asked.  Not yet. 
I heard he’s here somewhere.  If the dead
have ghosts, it must be the living
who haunt them.  A murdered woman called me
by her husband’s name.  I’m notthe man
who killed you, I said as gently as I could. 
I know, she said.  If the dead hunger,
it isn’t for revenge.  Like them,
I have no need to eat, though I’d like
to feel bread tearing between my teeth,
blueberries snapping open on my tongue. 
My hands hang useless on their hinges.
There’s little here that can stand our touch.

My mother waited years
to tell me: the morning after
my high school graduation,
she found her dead stepfather
eating chocolate cake in the living room. 
She said, Good morning. 
He nodded and licked blue frosting
from a plastic fork.  She knew
she was awake.  She could hear
the refrigerator’s solemn hum,
birds outside at the feeder. 
She wondered how he’d found
his way to a house built five years
after his death, wondered why
her mother hadn’t come—
but the dead deserve their rest. 
She drank a glass of water
and went back to bed. 
When she got up again,
the evidence—fork, plate, crumbs—
could’ve belonged to anyone.
 

 
The Ghosts I Want
 
If we make our dead the way we make
our lives, I choose ghosts in case
of emergency.  I know their stories:
the racecar driver who swears his dead
father’s hands closed around his ribcage
and pulled him from a flaming crash;
miners who escaped a cave-in
by following the lamp of a co-worker
they’d never met; a woman whose lifeConversations in War Time
 
On the patio of El Restaurante Jardín,
we have finished discussing
the job they will not offer me.
Talk turns to recent news:
the American woman, a lawyer, an activist,
married to a Guatemalan guerrillero, seized, missing.
She fears he’s dead, but she wants an accounting.
The governments—ours, theirs—
give her decades of dusty documents
and silence.
“What did she expect?” Diane asks,
swinging her empty beer bottle like a pendulum.
“For Christ sake, she married a guerrilla.
The army is supposed to kill him.”
“Romantic crap,” Greg snaps, spitting his disgust
into the cluster of impatiens beside him.
The tiny flowers have bright red faces,
prettier than the sunburns Diane and Greg wear.
They’ve spent their careers amid this war that isn’t theirs.
 
I’d like to say, after three years here,
I am unhardened, tender still
with reservations and respect.
A man’s life. A wife’s pain. These ought to matter.
Yet only the night before I stood with Alida on her doorstep,
a three-quarters moon above us,
 
 
as she told me how good life was in the early ’80s
when The General held absolute power.
The streets were quiet, safe.
Whoever might cause trouble couldn’t
in the far place they’d been led.
“But the impunity,” I said, “the way the army…”
She turned up her face, and her cheeks
shot back the moonlight.
Was it her beauty that cut short my words,
broke off my breath?
Men have been cowards for less.
 
Prince Charming’s Confession
 
I never thought my father would agree
to our marriage. She was, after all,
little more than a servant girl.
But he was eager, as he announced, to see me settle down,
though I think the real reason was because
he suspected my secret
and was desperate to conceal it
in the white smoke of matrimony.
I should have skipped town before my wedding day,
but I figured she, who grew up scrubbing floors,
would want what I wanted:
a top-down revolution,
pearls and porcelain to the peasants,
pitchforks in the hearts of the powdered and pampered,
and would pardon my lack of interest in producing an heir
in exchange for an equal share of power.
But when, on our honeymoon night,
I decried the proletariat’s pain,
she looked at me as if I was a talking mouse.
She cracked a smile and said,
“Come to bed, my liege,
and show me some noblesse oblige.”
I had to plead first-night jitters
and a lingering injury from a polo shot
too close to my groin.
She sulked in satin sheets
as I paced on the patio.
At last, I heard her liberating snores.
With money, it’s easy to flee.
I stopped to pick up Prince Eric
at the border,
though now he tells me he might be bi
and he kind of, sort of, sometimes misses Ariel,
despite her briny smell.
Back home, Cinderella’s turned tyrant;
her old lady’s in jail, she ordered her step-sisters guillotined.
My old man is living out his twilight in a cottage
behind the castle.
She has him over for tea on Tuesdays,
to pick his mind on affairs of state,
and while she treats him with the respect
an ex-monarch in his dotage deserves,
she can’t help but joke about his misfortune.
She told him she wouldn’t call herself queen.
She was saving the title, she said,
for me.
But what do I care?
I’m sitting by the pool, I’m drinking a daiquiri,
and here comes Lancelot,
shedding his knight’s hosiery
and giving me the eye.
You tell me: Who has the fairy tale ending?
 
Wine
 
But the news isn’t all bad.
Global warming, the Discovery Channel
informs us, makes certain wines taste better,
which means that in twenty years
we might all be vintners. And if grapes are
all we’ll be able to grow (on our roofs,
as the deluge swirls around us), well,
if you had to pick one fruit—or vegetable, even—
to live on for the rest of your life,
wouldn’t you pick the grape? All right,
so I’ll miss apples, oranges, pears, and plums.
I’ll miss carrots and cucumbers
and the occasional mouthful of spinach.
But raise your hand if you’ll mourn Brussel sprouts.
Our economy will be entirely wine-based,
with taxes paid in fluid ounces.
Drunk driving laws will have to be revised, of course.
And the drinking age will be lowered
to three.
This is a future we should celebrate:
A wine bar in every house,
every house a wine bar!
Lift your glasses, let us toast—
to wine!
And let’s drink again—
to wine!
And again—
and again!
You see: Before long, we won’t remember
what we’re missing. 
was saved by a housecall from a doctor
dead six weeks.  How much better
than guardian angels, these ghosts who love
the living too much to let them die? 
Each event ends with evidence
of impossibility: video reveals
the son’s body jerking backward,
nearly falling, as he untangles
burning legs from the steering wheel.
When rescue workers reach him,
he’s standing feet from the flames.
The miners gather on the surface,
every man accounted for except
their savior John, whose death by cave-in
is commemorated on a plaque
outside the shaft.  Fully recovered, the woman
finds the doctor’s daughter emptying
his apartment of everything except
his leather bag, unused for years.

Baptism
 
Tarsus
 
We are offerings
this time. Unwrapped
under a stone dome,
 
our glossed bodies
on heated marble,
sheets hewn by hands
 
two-thousand years ago.
Veils of steam over
lips, noses, eyes—
 
our prayers vapor
pressing an oval skylight
the width of a face.
 
Two women emerge,
mauve slips cellophane
swathing wide buttocks
 
and stomachs, brown areolas
pressed flowers. Baskets
of cloths and soap sway
 
from reddened hands.
These women wash us,
scrub with rough sponges
 
from back to ankle until
skin is pink and supple,
smooth polished stone.

Perge’s agora with art, and praise Anatolia’s cycle of holy women:

Praise the Air Force’s line of Ford trucks and their red-haired drivers
 
Praise students who wear wigs to college classes and once outside,
don headscarves, and praise raincoated mothers striding to market
on sunny mornings, toddlers decorating their skirts
 
Praise the sisters sitting at the fountain in Bursa’s silk bazaar, parcels
of fabric bundled before their feet, hair the color of leaves still holding

Climbing the Tallest Pine
 
The wind smells of clay
Across the surface of a thought.
If you endure
Wait for nothing.
 
The memorized trees
Could not remain.
 
It becomes only more difficult
To create a name
And hold pictures in your hand
 
Difficult to recite the facts,
To stay situated in the great dust,     
To call oneself
To race the leaves
And cry in a wide breath
 
For the first books you loved
In a function you could keep whole.
 
Where the baby vomited
Where a prayer began
It’s difficult climbing the tallest pine
Searching for an art
 
That wants to be an art,
Not a conjunction nor a prize,
Only an empty altar
Made without mercy.
 
Visited without mercy.
 
Assemblage Without Technique
 
Within the light of the needle
Hunted birds stirred into flight
Above a stretch of sand without a flag.
Bring your camera for the moment when we are lost.
The public faces age in magazines,
I just grow old on my pillow.
When the morning planets confuse my biology
I throb at the core, walking away
In the cold blue of the rain.
Carried in the silence of human muscle,
Spitting into a puddle that held the sky.
Every day there is something finished in a pattern that disappears.
A face struggles to stay inside itself,
Words held in electric marrow,
In lights flashing across a ceiling at midday
In the burning wine of the skull.
Coughing phlegm out of a noonday nap
The body is touched and born into destruction.
In vanished places of the ocean blood
I give birth to some creature
I can never see.
 
 
 
Composition in a Snowfield
 
The face bleeds and it disappears.
I close my eyes in a snowstorm.
The blade is imaginary, the blood is real.
I want to lie down, I can’t remember.
The deer pass through the ghosts of the garden
And into a vein of voices.
Lights are fading along the highway.
Now this is a territory cleared
Of guns and broken glass.
A pot of water boils in the past;
Those were my Easter eggs.
I hold them in an apron now,
Years of them now
Beneath the trees that stick to the sky.
The cranial nerves are cut from their tears
And the snow and the field are one.
Whoever cried is dying in hands that slipped away.
I want to lie down in this storm
Clutching my ladder of bones.
Above me, the cows driven home to Jesus Christ
Past the branches of the captives hanging there.
Now I am picked up and out of my red rubber boots.
I have wet myself and I drink tea
Brewed from white flowers pulled
From the dark holes of the head.
I think of nakedness and the dream I had
Of large meals by the sea,
Yellow school buses lined up in the ran.
A faceless God touching me with my own hands,
White sails made of milk and snow.
 
From the Face of a Painter’s Hour
 
Something purple bled from the face
Into a basin for my dirty hands.
In the knowing of this thing
That cannot be dispersed,
This haunted thing so endlessly hurt
In the circle of itself
Something purple dripped from the brush.
This timid and self pitying and self hating
Breather of itself in a pulse
Always ready to be quickened.
How might I hold it long enough.
I was happy walking toward heaven behind my father,
Happy to be pulled under water by God.
How well the rocks of heaven held the sleeping children,
How carefully we stepped
On our way to the sleeping place.
With purple feet small in the dark sand,
Little eyes, so many in the dark wind,
Two violinists came to watch the choosing,
Though how can we know
What is painted or not painted
Upon us.

 wellness hidden in  
 that inevitable: Nature

 where heart appears, 
 not to turn, nor become 

 tender bliss 
 dwindling in the light 
 of the moonless earth

 — and the house, 
 shifted into that great 
 tide-worn blue swirling

  in groves with feathers 
  on the outside bare planks 
  
 we were lost by the words so we made up our flesh

Space vanished in a soft black light.
 A love glanced happiness.
 A circle, praying for the living. 

 		I am thee!

 You put your pain against you. 
 You imagine time.

This dry-gulch pump routine is 
 an intelligent thing. A single calm world 
 filled with mud in the dark.

 It is something you bought with a cold hand. 
 A tightening from the center, climbing wherever.

Quiloa,

  to linger 

 Lost in the vein, 
 Following the earth's 
 Shadows over nebula rock

 A pine swirling like incense 
 in the narrow afternoon of hell.

I Am Leaving — 


 The first prey of feelings 
 is writing. 

 I never keep much. 
 
 Even from within the grave, windows 
 cannot creep over this poem's nest.

	 Over the moors: an odour 
	 of common stone in the medial pines.

	 Her smile, a cypress standing within roses upon the sun.

	 You dream this tragic light between minds. 
	 
	 Mute. Transformed

 The top of your cliff 
 Where one chained 
 Form is like love or a bull
 Chiming about power

 Bread passion mystery, 
 mainsails and eucalyptus.

Light snowdrifts
  near the depot

                  My tongue tucked in: 
                  keel, lounged. 
 
Wabash con anew, 
 deep horizon, 
 ringed. 


 		          Shockwaves tax-deductible
 		          at the parting. 
 

 Forget muscles

Now Iconographic 

 And supine kingfishers tickle fodder's sea-lice, 
 And the masts run above the pines, 
 And we declare the living fire a marish lyric: 
 And in the burnt mint, we weep. 

 And driving their blinking 
 blue pink, and blue moidores foot flock, 
 
 The ocean stronger burqas the exquisite curls 
 of the clerk's thought, each spark spur, 
  a drunkard's lantern 
    engulfing, silence

 Love remains set; and the roof, unwoven, 
  stretched and swept up the sky's shoe.

 secretes an opening.

In Machines. 

 Schemas move from an old sack.

   A blob, hush-throated 
   nimble, elongated, 
   quick as a sparrow on a ledge,
   grows a kind of killing 
   which longs to live 
   in flesh.

Abandoned limbs, promised, others use for yearning. 
 The hearse is thinner, and the last wilderness is here.  
 Departure's doctor whispers anguish to dreams.

 We are at the beginning: surrealism. 
 
 Carpeted forgiveness
 dreams her breeds. 

 Time sends each birth
 heart-sickness and requires
 ascents to camp-life. 

 As she looks for the PIN 
 to her jaws, in the humming 
 Snowflake-diamond-snowflake house, 
 A mineral-swollen window dies.

 burled in earthen feet
 airstream "Cowboys" 
 unwholesome Biloxi summer ash, and 
 mud analogies of intent 

 juddle in the cellar, 
 rage; an inexorable leg

 your mother 
 feeding the dirt
 with a slow cold tongue. 

 and when sorrow splinters, 
 the clay of ecstasy 
 moon-glazed gazes toward Istanbul!

Catastrophe. 

 
 Death dissidents weeping
 take us to the dust,

 Lose the Slow 
 Branches that describe. 
 
 Now indite. Anyone for the chance.
 Letters Pin the sand.

 And drank honey-milk flow-down streets from lovers' hips:
 Supermarkets, Lawns, Ladders.

 Quinceañiera, On This Least Day 


 Democracy? No. Generations of justice talk. 
 I want some easy gentleman to suck the exhaust out of me. 
 
 I chase the costly peril of starlet bare statues. 
 Stump the old Bilbea, the typewriter speaking, 
 a harpoon-line of perfect parties piercing a secret past.

 So weep, run, then die!

 Wool divides the deep sea, 
 	roiling fragrant, 
 	growing epiphanies.  
 
 It sets an anchor in the floral trellis. 
	Illuminates time with snow. 
 	Prune-mulches impersonal sweat. 

 Wrathful, it herds lemons  
    into ambiguous compelling floods.

I covet visitation; 
--I, her nest. 

 I tell this night that it was desperate.

 Under a red branch new from a miracle

 My children gouge the wooden charts 
     of a dreadful heart

 On the same transparent shore,
 I sat Lightning in the tesselation





		~ + ~

           


Night poured into destiny's shrunken bucket. 
 The encrusted, cadenced plaything of the disease. 
 
 We argue existence's ash-grey violence. 
 Locusts among the bushes of the evening.

 Touch, consume, dominate.

 And slip through altitudes, heaving. 
 In the brief black summer sky unseen 
 In the silent length of affinities 
 gut-sifting peremptory repertoires.

 It drives each thing,

	    crowds 
	   the fossil

 Apertures

 I curved the rooms of blood. 
  Cherubim in Central ceremony's Center, 
  Orestes-like, a plow to practice splinters, 
 and wound each wood, and bring salt into numbed churches, 
	 a secret anvil slavery
	  leaping in an hour of wine.

 so to fathom this 

 where no one may discover 
 where the roof works at the mouth

 and dreary-voiced wheat 
 leaks a bright scar
 
 we'll take the identity of waves 
 momentarily uprooted sweaters 
 
 and the chill of brung-homes coals
 marveling over the question of the midnight

AND HER EYES 

 touched like a 100 watt lamp
 his frozen face

 etching clean lines

Are you going home? 

 Outside, apples the color of homage 
   bend abiding heads into sleep

 Blurry immortal fresh

 shine as if oblivions

   For cold lies heaven
  to kill most lost

 There is nothing

    and all the distant afternoon 
         clouds settle
    where the spring moss flowering splinters

 Oh, born we died

 And low, poised in the mind

	   radiant 

 The universe 
   is not a part but
     single, nothing.

 I thought that nothing thought, 
 my hand  where I had loved you. 
 
 I thought we had died,  
 deeper than the quick. 
  
 Sometimes I saw a Summer, 
 and thought  of everyone. 
 
 In the vein of the hours, 
 prophesying never fading.

 Flesh like a foaming compact nesting
   battered movement to mend a mouth.

 We paid the horizons with flesh, 
   soothed the many-petalled sky. 
  
 I was forgotten.
 I in a pale grave. 
 I shrieking in the water.

You took the first

 And crossed the border crater where 
 A rooster burned, outlined in cold petals.

 i-seen, random
 on the drowned train

 summer, then, helps them plunge

 inspired by machines,
 a vast unconscious

 Star-points insist
 Sun mould-black

 Phallus fogs our skin with dust,

 Sing--mystery 
 
 She was not dead. 
 The bones of her day

A HIGH-SCHOOL GUN 

 
 wander each night in shadows, 
  proud, plight, spoiled

 feed silk a Hurricane
 and see her pale miraculous hair 

 reveal what must be done 
 to the last endangered contraptions

A love
  lifted momentarily
   from an avenue 
    of serpents

  Blue, the table, 
  the milk, on the pock-marked 
     telephone. 
 
 Now my mother, afraid of holding air 
   in her arms, stops the silence
      ringing in her mouth.

 Keen to intrude, to celebrate entering.

 Four bones kept me heavily dead.


 A secret, not meticulously, 
   started carving Spring. 
 
 A serious heart

SO OFTEN MOCK-HORMONAL -- 

 
 Clouded as a wire. hand-painted,

 We are pain,

 Everyone is gone,
       rendering love 
    in the sun's spires

       so calm and dangerous, 
     their forests pure and correct 
 their memory corner needles evolving 
      a being real dreamed thought

    before disappearing in a stream 
  of passion: wounded muffled light





		~ + ~

      



AND UNKNOWN. 

 In the madhouse 
 he had already frayed the lobster 
 wove some intangible beginnings into predictions 
 pictures were made bodies
 and everything, unnamed -- cried: 
    slow the mind

 It begins in your hair
 iceberg rationalism, alone, 
 valour crackling

There we lay; some bedstraps crossing the edge of the sills, 
 shrieks of light costuming the waterfall against the pear.

 We come back into the crusted air, in the grave, 
  laugh in (exhaled, fanatic) 
   moss passion, where skin
    comes to praise.

 It was still comparative
  a skein of forms
  full of glades

 protests and the clear pointed city 
  cutting out nimbostratus

	  we were following
	 hallelujah coupled sharks
	 thru the halted war

 We all laboured to posture rhyme, 
 Which been lacking, on the outcrop 
 Among the tonguing temptation, and the sidewalk 
 Dripping fire

 The wind masters
 the raw crystal-formation
 belonging to open delay. 
 
 Virus, Triton, Rumsfeld, Armado. 
 Pipes shuffling suiciding blows.

 And I go,
 Ended in the gladness of the soul

 I say that every day is a morning 
   failing, confused and sparse

 I hold sleeping book—word powers; 
 I am a shrimp propellor. 

 And the daisies. 
 I believed I made.

    A black beak hung in my bucket.

Song of Sex 

 A woman's mouth is 
 painted on the horizon

 thickening its shining spring, the dark grass is poured 
 in her first tree, and the coated bud of the night grows 
 by the moon that puts her life against the day, 
 walking over old reason toward the dead

 I tore my gown, soft among birches.
 I absorbed the tongues of solitary animals. 
 I was the rockledge sun floating by the waters. 
 I saw bulbs gleam in the sweet blessed close-knit laughter of sorrow.

 Constrained companions, 
 touch the grove
 unmated, by the sob. 
 
 Tomorrow, replace
 the spectacle itch:
 help the sufficient

 And in the wrath
 Of this boat, 
 Strange cholera
 Pains take on, through a thing of hands,

the sun in her cries to thorn-ridged,

 in the inauspicious world pawned intermittent grass.

 And this blood was to be counted
 Called for later if we returned
 it was to complete what things opened

 and the bare facade of its (destructive and ashen) will
 weaves every place like an old butterfat 
 curves crepuscule moss into meditation

ACROSS THE DEAD — 

 Lambs in a sky 
  of frozen 
 rumination, hooting, 
  to distract us
  with retirèd doctrines
 
 Standing in great darkness, 
   hauling the wind, 
 rising, slightly cold

AND THE ONE SHALL SCOLD FLESH 

 
       A great limping 
 Heart, soft on life — 

           apt to be ashamed 
 rode power into unendowed time

   went to its knee in a swamp
  of nourishing pills, - clean  
   watching the enthralled die

 And Rhinehardt 
 ran from the rayon fence 
  ran from its wrath

 And the world of authentic speed
  walking the bubbles home
   in the deepest plumes, 
     pawing your arm

 Numquam! O, I'm sorry 
          I had much-loved 
 yet careless, I die
 
 and what therefore I didn't say 
        seeps in,  living,
  returns, 1934-2014 
 
 As I ordered  the hours
 Rejoicing,    to take away 
               the world.

 Dactylic and turnip blueberry,

TO THAT THOUGHT, I JOINED SORROW 

 with ardor once more
 to take away some hour 
 and stir its murmuring gutters 
 
 and dense, bark by the hedges
 hiding my head over the upper lip of my neck 
 noting no place where thought could tread

I have no loss, 
 let them grieve and mock
  this Quiet

 So this keening wants to try,
  the hard seat of the Haloed.

 Perhaps the time that unaware, 
  Viaduct speckled, figures
 Vernal satisfaction and love.

IN THE NIGHT 

 self-absorption asks: 
	 should I do green? 
	 remember the kitchen scalding blue?
	 buy rubber cigarettes? 
	 double the hands, shrouded up like a tablecloth? 
	 change before one last bored effort at sex?

 I was seen dorking racehorses. 
 Teaching stones to sing. Opening 
 Airstreams through the maples. 

 I wanted to 
 whisper. 
 
 I'd give them a feel 
 I was doing nothing.

 Louche mockingbird's heart on the sagging crest:
  so pathetic,

 Laugh to me, my heart 
 Grow on my throne like a stain. 

 Tread the sun with horrible chowder.

MR. BIBLE IS NOT GOOD 

 me, I am better
 me, clean earth 

 Mr Bible married such blessings 
 he loosened chubby silver quarreling. 
 
 I was the black slave plantations 
 where he had Churches and Sawmills.

 I was the target 
 crosshatching on a she-whale's 
 side hit by his harpoon.
 
 And his theft of death into heaven, 
 where death is enervated, I will not tolerate.

CANCER 

 Much like a machine,
  its undershirt is rivulet gasoline. 
 
 And it is the duty, the stone, and the abyss

 And it is an attribute of honey, 
  when it frees the light of God.

     And when Odyssey came to windmills

Hot dolphins sack 
 the horizon where men in scorned Infection

  Not Infected with

      but an Infection 
       within my throat 
    driven by quartz light to fire.

THE YEAR'S HEART

 radiating Congo bright shirt

 and rice closed in its flowers

 We perish in these arteries,

 Sad afternoons flensing the cycles of the lily,
 The radio, a stone, pecked-over, in dusty rain.

 Ah, to the Church I came in September 
 triumph burned into my coherence
 torrents enclosed merrily in my amazement

 in that ignoble place where absorption denied pain.

  Leaned through the field with conclusions

This is the journey: spasm scream.

 War smells better. The fallen star,
 the bitten deer, the tracked fireflies, 
     the sweat of green dust.

An underground orchard, clay 
 touches in the fields. Alone: 
 its shadow ripens constellations 
     of foaming tears.

She never puts it in verse: 
       does not embed skin

 She, in self-denial, receives the rats.

 In her wing-burdened arms are mint walls, 
    and mists that sing of plums.

 Leaving the formless

A series of white squares, each
an hour's flying time, each with instructions
in pencil: the organized adventure....a crowd of Javanese walking up a volcanic mountain.
They laugh and talk, they carry baskets
and various loads on poles....The plane staggers with the weight of fuel,
becomes lighter and then
light. The last square has
an island in it, but cannot
lead her there.Under a microscope there are lights in a leaf
that flicker and go out, as the leaf dies.She wonders what holds her life together.
Not herself; she too is held.
Something does it like daylight through
a glass of water.Trying to get my head out of the way
without moving my eyes
was an occupation that gave me numerous headaches
and glasses before I was five. Older philosophers
have gotten worse results
from similar exercises.One thing the mothers and sisters and teachers
		were careful not to mention
		but that grandmothers boldly engaged in
		as if it didn't matter what anybody said,

		was dying, walking into
		the empty mirror just out of sight,
		darkening to a silhouette in which someone else
		appears, someone familiar --            an imitation grain,
		small strokes and walnut swirls,
		intricate as weather patterns
		in a satellite's eye              the imagined person, the one
		made with small strokes
		on this paper
		that used to be trees.		IV.
		Ivy that is.
		Had you forgotten.
		X.A stone jar smoothes with use. Useful.
An open door is empty.They raise honey bees as well in the alcove,
		the oldest part of the wall.
		Their will is very old. They and we
		arrange straw for the bees in niches some of which are
		occupied also by stone saints.
		The bees are particular since
		the straw creates their cloisters. Finally we forget what we are carrying and do not
		make mistakes.
A series of white squares, each
an hour's flying time, each with instructions
in pencil: the organized adventure. "Carelessness
offends the spirit of Ulysses." She suspends herself,
as he did, in the elements, finds
reason turns to motion, caution to design.
"One ocean led naturally to
another." Earth led naturally to sky
after a look at a thing of wood and wire
at the state fiar in Des Moines, after the sting
of snow blown from the skis of training planes
near Philadelphia.
                                                    The rumble of the red and gold
Electra wakes the air, shakes stars
down their strings until
they hang outside the cockpit, close enough
to touch. Squares, like quickened days, take turns
showing her senses

what to do. The fragrance of blooming
orange orchards carries to considerable
altitudes. "No one has seen a tree
who has not seen it from the air, with
its shadow." Lake Chad is huge, shallow,
brightened by the wings of cranes and maribou
storks. The Red Sea is blue; the White and Blue Niles,
green; the Amazon delta a party of currents,
brown and yellow, distinct. Beyond

the clutter of sensations, the shriek and clatter
of tools at landing fields, she renews
herself, like the engine, for
one thing. Flight
above the wine-dark shining flood
is order, makes the squares
come and go, makes the plane
a tiny gear that turns the world. "Of all those things
external to the task at hand, we clutch
what we can."
                                          She leaves the plane briefly to join
a crowd of Javanes walking up a volcanic mountain.
They laugh and talk, they carry baskets
and various loads on poles. "Sometime
I hope to stay somewhere as long as I like." For

the last long passage she abandons personal items,
souvenirs; also the parachute, useless over the Pacific.
The plane staggers with the weight of fuel,
becomes lighter and then
light. The last square has
an island in it, but cannot
lead her there.
	returns from the forests of Assam
	in which he verified the Tea shrub to be
	indigenous, abundant, and virtually
	inaccessible. At noontime on the upper deck he brews
	an ordinary Canton cup; salt tempers its oils, discolors
	the spoon. The backs of his hands shine.
	The Quaker captain
	nods twice a day. Afternoons,
	Thomas visits the Thibetan goat, the ten curious sheep
	from Singapore; he looks for cracks or seepage in the lacquer
	of oil tubs, checks the fleet of crates--cheated
	of tea, they carry tortoise shell, jars of green
	ginger.
                    Sweet evenings,
	it is not the mild vegetable infusion of his family's name
	to which he turns to soothe the tick of unused muscles
	before sleep, the cabin's tilt and tilt
	about the hammock's axis; he downs
	a glass or two, another few,
	and tinkers with the fates of friends, acquaintances
	he has not seen these thirteen years.
	Stood out of the estuary, just
	afternoon; junks
	joisted baskets of exploding crackers, gongs
	talky at our going. The constant stir of water is
	a second silence. The men are calm; sleeping
	without blankets, they perfect
	our vulnerability. I balance, idly, old
	accounts--the Fox & Geese, Hampstead: 7 chests pekoe,			
	tincture of rubarbe, sugar in loaves &
	for Sundries Forgott. -- and write odd
  letters: a faster ship may pass for them.
                                                           Around Good Hope,
heavy weather, a hundred ducks
drown in the hold. Now
I keep to my cabin, a pint
of bitters. In all this wash it comforts me
to see sharp things, the nice
strokes about the elephant's ear
in the aquatint I have for you. I am uneasy
at whales. Algae thickens: we must be near

belled towers. Squares.
Oh solid and to be praised
stone gates, meadows, your estate.
At night an abundance: yellow, white
windows.
The paraphernalia required
to take the turn-of-the-century photograph
must have been considerable
but common enough
that no one is paying much attention
to the contraption on the beach
-- most of the secondary figures show
as backs of hats, or
backs. The donkey, of course, is
disinterested, head half out of the frame.
It is the style of his species
to be undisturbed
by messiahs or machines, whatever
their reception by another genus.

In the two dimensions
of the brown and white photo
printed crooked on a post card,
the woman seems to be wearing
the building behind her as a hat: two large
arched windows and cupolas --
one louvered -- of a streetcar station
frame her head
as a pagoda does a sitting saint.
Under the brim is a fringe
of tassles, which are distant women
in long skirts on a curved sidewalk
going to meet the next car.

With bare legs dangling
around the donkey's barrel,
two children stare at the mountainous
camera on command; their histories pause
in their held breath. A hand
on one shoulder of each child
like parentheses or white
halves of a prayer, she stands
behind durable beast and passengers,
pointing the latter in the direction
of their inscrutable futures
while other people hurry up the street
to catch theirs
and the century turns a corner
of its own invention.
The maze is round and blue and green.
Clouds float over it,
and feathered ounces fly --
ouzels, loons; their cries sound
like miniature wine-glasses breaking
against the crusty earth.
The birds are white flares starting
from dark trees and viny swamps
as if in celebration. But what
festival is here? Are the droplets flung
from the hands of drowning men
tossed in joy like rice at weddings --
the worthless coins with which
they try to buy their breath back from the sea;
are their last cries
choked with gladness?
                                             The globe is lovely. Colors
fit together in intricate designs
that wash away, and form again;
the planet in its veil of weather
wobbles, bright and dark. Clouds
and birds and cries
rise and turn together, fall.
Dissolving, they make circles
within the circles of the seas.
And land circles sea in
an ancient sort of dance.
God and the author knew
where the mice got the motorboat,
but they had it and some
confidence in finding their way
based on a hat with tea roses
they mistook for a chart.
The blooms were bodies of water;
stems, navigable waterways.
I remember a picture of the important hat,
concerned mice
crowding around it.

The vignette is both
brief incident
and running ornament, originally
leaf or grape, appearing
throughout a text.
Hence the bird, which flies quickly
into my mind and out again
several times a year.

The further we move from stories
that explained the world to us as children,
the more the images silt in, become
imbedded in our lives
and the lives of lovers,
friends. Boat,
lamp, sky, bird,
are no longer abstract.

Shall I take you for a sail,
sister? The boat you helped me buy
is old and strong. Shall I take you
flying, one wing in water, the other in air,
skating on the seam
between ocean and sky?

Years ago a bird flew into the cabin
of the sailboat where my two friends
were sleeping,
circled cleanly in the small space
and flew out again, past my face
into fog, and night, and the rush and bubble
of the fat boat pressing through
wave and wave and wave
in the middle of chart 13260,
east of Maine.

Now the wind picks whitecaps
out of the black water
between our boat and the power plant.
From its stacks, tipped with red lights,
fine black grit sifts downward.
We recognize ourselves as Adults
from our children's books, the ones
who seemed to knkow what they were doing.

The wind that meets the body of the sail
and curls against it, a few feet up,
is stronger than the wind on deck.
Water is less easily displaced
at the bottom of the propeller's circle
than near the surface. Most distinctions
are gradual; clear-cut ones appear
in fairy tales and in the colors
on the chart. White.
Turquoise. Tan.

How many stories have I heard
or read in thirty-five years?
They begin to remind me of each other;
the images vignette, shade off
into the ground that is my own
story.

I have been anxious to know
where I am going.
It is slowly occurring to me
that it doesn't matter, or it's too late,
or the question is irrelevant.
We are moored here
in Salem Sound
taking spray on deck, the boat
bucking and water creaming at the bow
without our going anywhere
but a few feet up, a few feet down,
and some weaving back and forth.
We read aloud to each other.
We tell each other stories about our childhoods
lived in the same house
six years apart.
We listen to the wind, read some more
in the cabin lit with candle lanterns.
I sleep
lightly, and in my dream
the bird flies into the cabin
and makes one circle, the shape
of the world, the shape of a hat,
the shape of the stories we make of ourselves
asleep, awake.
All her instruments read zero.
The cockpit is filling with water.
She crawls onto the fuselage, knowing
it is done, the flight she started from New York
and another one as well. Lying on the plane's tinny
wing, hollow as the bones of a bird, she looks up
at the last cloud she had fuel to fly through
and tells herself: it's a warm night,
don't shiver.
                   The tail tilts up and she slips
into the sea, her leather jacket heavy instantly.
When she knows it is time to take
a first last breath of water
she makes it deep,
writhes

and loosens,
sways down through colored
layers to the mud. White
crabs and bottom-feeding fish
take back the miles, one by one,
and seaweek twists in wreaths around
the rusting struts and bright wings
she rode down.
My arms try their reach
toward books on upper shelves
instead of stars,
but I am drawn
by the pilot at the bottom of the sea.
I want to remember her
gently, find
her lack of fear, shape
my years into a flight
that embraces the world
and let go onlyl when
there is no other way.
Before what is myself becomes
stiff and glazed, I will
talk to myself, to you; we are
falling together.
Your sister's sitting for you Vuillard
intérieur, jeune fille assise
among the plants and her hands are empty
intérieur. rouge et gris

She looks straight out of the colors Edouard
intérieur. bleu et vert
The house is a frame. She doesn't go out
intérieur. fenêtre ouverte

The leaves in the print of her dress can't drink
from the window's glass of air.
The blind lets in light in bars you can see;
she's clear as yourself Vuillard
Plaster drops from the long thin boards
into my shoes at night.
I like seeing bare laths, the truth
of how a house hangs on. What did I think
walls were? I saw only
the costume, paper wrappers over
the stuff of them.

Nothing could disguise the catastrophe
of your bed. It clanked, it rattled,
it shrieked: it must have had
moving parts, like a heart.
If we had slid underneath and looked up
-- what mysteries! All the machinery
of a pre-Copernican universe, whirs and wheels,
clicks and clutches, pulleys and bearings and

brakes. I know there were brakes.
The underparts of the bed must have been
as intricate as the rituals you had
in the morning, the ones you had at night,
to keep away fires, and lightning, and hurt.
They didn't work.

I was afraid of your fears and left you, trailing
loose clockworks. What did I think
a love was? Through the wall
I hear a new one moving.
	A carafe beside her bed or a glass goose;
	a piece of water, stoppered, or a solid chunk, like ice?
	She watches it all night,
	death, the brightening star.
	She thinks it is one with her all along
	or she thinks it is the final thing she contains.

	She reads all night.
	Under a microscope there are lights in a leaf
	that flicker, and go out, as the leaf dies.

	All night.
	Cities of lights.
	A glass of water has as many.
	The smallest piece of water has lights in it,
	she reads, and looks
	at the carafe to find
	a juggler tossing jugglers holding stars.

	She is a maze. She finds a candle at each
	corner but loses the way. She thinks
	she can make it up as she goes, strike
	a bargain, make it stick.
	Or she thinks she can't,
	turns again.

	She wonders what holds her life together.
	Not herself; she too is held.
	Something does it like daylight through
	a glass of water.

	She has a son. He cuts his hands in grass,
	long grass that leads to the sea.
	He listens to water.

	She has a song for him, tells him
	the first ladder was a fern; she shows him the lines
	that craze a leaf, says she's not, he's not
	out of the woods yet, praise be.
	Whatever he sees in his hands is beautiful.
	He sees lines; stones; lumps of glass, often
	(often they are green); a carved cat; he sees
	the last day of his life.

	Looking closer doesn't change things.
	Through a magnifying glass obsidian is still
	glossy, like a muscle; a moth's wing
	porous as manila paper.

	He thinks he could put a bottle together in his hands
	if he had all the pieces. He looks
	for them, stands

	waist deep in grass among the dull
	green lamps of fireflies, hundreds, below
	night-hawks flashing their wing-bars like lights shot
	from a wave.

	Days open and fold. Geese
	slide through them, French curves.
	The hawks shriek and turn;
	they are pieces.

	His rooms are a forest of things that have
	touched him, including a jar
	of rain, a pair of marble pigeons.
	He picks up some white glass to give it away
	and keeps it.

	His hands tell him everything. They ache
	when a friend he desires turns away. Still
	he thinks he can find and keep them
	all, all his days.
As you were.
What are you looking at now.
I'd imagined you too long, made a hieroglyph
of your bright hair.
You came and were gone.

A scenario: the grey birds and the white birds
adjoin each other like words.
Adjacent.
The roots of thousands of plants press against the walls;
inside on the walls all my friends are dancing together.
If one is gathering facts
these are merely adjectives.
Regardless.
The failure of not having seen is nothing like
the failure of not having looked.

The verb "to come."
How did you know about caves?
You knew where I would come and gave me a prophetic
look.
The book about caves is filled with pictures,
words and pictures, the moving cat
in several positions.

The leaves of a vine or a sentence.

I suppose we are adjacent if you want to
go that far.
I have rented a burrow for the winter;
if it were a donkey I would ride to see you.
My words were sent
to see you;
the rest of you is left to read the book,
the birds,
the walls.
You return like a new moon, lost friend found, you
build, retreat; a glacier. Coarse & steaming
caribou rummage over it, leaving tracks the size of
dinner plates; beneath its creaking mass, forests

bruise to coal. Yet you pass lightly through
the glass doors between my days, as easily as the sea
lifts and carries its tonnage of ice-shapes, that
broken alphabet. Right hand meets left: as often

you come, from countries in the sea & continents
of snow. Where I live, the woods bloom thinly,
black and white. Still, there are tracks. Still
the branches empty of your weather, and fill.
Plants pull light through the windows, save it up.
He keeps pennies and birdseed in potsl. In other rooms
men sing loud as cossacks carousing in their socks.
They drink to the rowdy sun. A yellow bulb

of liquor warms in his hands; he rubs them dry
on flannel sleeves. Outside, with practiced shrugs,
ducks adjust their plumages, which are white
purses nearly translucent in the sun. He adds ice

to his glass. Doing things one by one keeps days
apart, keeps him from stopping on the roominghouse steps,
forgetting to go in. He thinks: the clutter of ducks,
the plants, are forms of sunlight, smaller lights.

He thinks if he remembers everything, everything
will fall into place -- the men, the drunken words they sing.
Two fish
alive, strangely, in air
lay fat and heavy,
one in my hands and one in yours,
and looked peaceful,
happy, even.
We hadn't caught them;
shiny and solid,
they materialized
as we sat in the dinghy
in a harbor
under the wide sun,
looking at each other,
good friends.
What I remember
after falling up the familiar darkness
that always surprises
at the end of sleep
is that they were different:
yours had stripes
and mine was mottled.
So the meaning that follows me
above the surface of sleep
(the meaning, always less
than the dream)
is that we are different,
in the middle of all we share, and that
we can be peaceful with that fact,
happy, even, in our strangely
shining lives.
Look at the birds in the tree,
you said. It sounded like a sentence
for children learning to read.
We drove toward the tree.
The starlings lifted as one
and printed, on the white sky,
a second tree beside the first.

The trees I am looking at now
are blue ones on the white china cup
warm in my hands.
The radio is tuned between stations
because the fizz helps me think,
blurs the voices that rise
through the wooden floor.
Sometimes they are children's,
cutting through wood and static
like the cries of herring gulls.
What? Why? Why?
Why do they ask so many questions?
Why do you ask such hard ones?

There were no curtains
in this small room by the sea.
A roll of glazed, white paper,
meant to wrap wedding presents,
instead protects my privacy, tacked across
the four windows. They bleach sunlight
to the color of flour.

The grove of blue trees
surrounds a pool of coffee,
black like roads in cities
and birds in wet spring trees.
It sounds like a story
children learn to read from,
words forming slowly in their minds
next to their images
of tree, road, bird.

Covered, the windows are screens.
On one of them I see us driving
under a sky streaked with birds.
You are careful of my privacy,
and your own; the questions,
infrequent anyway, stop
if you see I feel pushed.
They ask me
to make the globe in my head
a good place to live.

Words can form maps
to make the world clearer.
I care about you.
Birds hidden in the china trees
fly up in a blue stream.
When I go into the day
they color the sky.
Some wood lightens with use: paths
I walk through these five rooms
are the color of grain --
wheat, let's say, for its productive
connotation. The staff
of life, however, is work
enjoyed.
Some wood
darkens with sweat, smoothes:
ax handles, slender and delicately curved.
Leaned against a shed
somewhere in my childhood,
the axes were taken in at night
to keep them from rust
and racoons. The latter
craved salt left
by the sweet work of humans
who craved the work.
Chips from my grandfather's blade
were thick, uniform
and hot in my fingers.

Hey, you,
is this where we're going to live?
Worn wood house, floors
gone honey-colored, dark
doors. A city house
since it was built, although
the city wasn't always urgent
(trucks shake the walls, sirens
rattle windows): once
only hoofbeats
on hard sand, carriage springs
squeaking.

The blonde wood of the doors
is painted with an imitation grain,
small strokes and walnut swirls
intricate as weather patterns
in a satellite's eye.
Every door in costume,
a few understudies stacked
in the basement.
Hey, you.

When I was in grade school
I looked at things
more slowly.
I noticed the grain in desktops,
put out my hand
to each new iron-legged comrade, confidante, menotr,
as if to introduce myself, felt
its surface, rubbed smooth
with the rubbed spines of many books,
the same book over and over,
but different students reading differently.

Hey, you,
in an old house
with tools that want to be used.
A few cracked windows. Outside them,
cars and radios and shouting people
make a city.
Inside, I discover the door's duplicity
by looking at wood carefully for the first time
in years. Real wood
made into imagined wood.

So the you I'm calling to,
the you that is me,
the one who wants to tell me
everything I know,
is both real and invented,
the woman whose name is on the front door
and the imagined person, the one
made with small strokes
on this paper
that used to be trees.
	A pier glass as a conjunction.
	3 glasses in a line.
	Looking out            looking back            looking out.
	She holds up stones to see
	them glossed, pitchers of milk, porcelain,
	quartz; herself among them.
	Beyond the sills the white clay hills appear
	and do not            appear:
	a partial view of the cliffs.
	Hills of china,
	hills of france. She
	compares, holds & beholds
	earthenware            paper trees            a wood duck            decoys.
	The glass is in her hands, her eyes. The vase
	contains voices, her own
	among them.
	A bottle is a breakwater; an eye holds
	a shotglass of the light the world sees.
	Her image flashing for an instant in his gaze
	shatters but recurs, a surface looking in.
	A linear impression: a hand-painted piece, perhaps

	These fragments frame a question. A

	The figure in the glass returns at length.
Come for tea,
chickadee in the evergreen; clear green tea.
How long. Oolong.
Music on the porch.
Foxtrots on the lawn. The stems of the mint
are as square as the steps. Come.

Comfortable. A white cloth.
Cream tea, sugar tea, round. Steep
steep tea and light brown light.
Earl grey watercolors, glazed
clay urn.

The azaleas are lovely. Why
be one? People do that, put colors on. Why be
jasmine tea drinking.
Among the bittersweet bushes
people keep talking and drinking.

I watch the easiest one.
Someone at ease is at home, his house is
anywhere a capital letter made from
the air about him. An initial,
what is the rest.
The house of air vibrates in the sun: his voice
unfolds, a bird unperching.

Things keep going away.

We two make a system, water and land.
A shore is an assurance, it moves a bit but it stays.
I see you, his look says, open
as the air that holds us both. Some water
is ice; people do that too, go cold and hard.
Everything does. Transparent puzzles

are difficult to assemble, the mind's
a delicate subject he says.
His words fall down like pebbles, a lot of letters
he puts together and throws away.

Things go away, no one can keep
a river around.

The last of the mint-light light from
the big elm lamps.
The last of the glossy ice, yellow tea, the last
taste taken at the engle
at which birds brake.
He goes. Come again. I see
a G clef shatter
in the empty glass set down.
It holds us, gently,
together.
It presses out, against the eardrum.
It presses in. It curls
in the palms of our hands

but holds nothing
to itself. It steps over
the sock flung onto the chair, the blouse
on the floor. When we touch,
it moves aside -- a modest medium

that solid things displace.
The children running down the street
punch through it, leaving
a cut-out shape of each position
hovering behind them
for an instant.

It is made of round
spinning things, but
it will adjust to a rectangular space such as
a room.
It's the only company
the old man who stays in his long underwear all day
has.
He comes onto the porch at noon
to get more.

People identify it by objects it surrounds.
They call it "atmosphere."
What people see is
themselves: they approve or they don't,
they leave for good or they come back.
Air is innocent of such judgments, having
no personality to protect.

It has
a simple habit:
it fills anything.
It occupies entire hotels
in the off season.

It is drawn to emptiness as to
a question it answers. Only a person
can puzzle it: the vacancy interior,
locked behind the eyes.

It stays whole, flows around
the wall, the knife.
We can change it
as much as ourselves, or
another person:
very little.
It clings to us,
a loose but unshakeable
garment, transparent
plumage, a thin
atmosphere to our far-flung
colonies.

We share it
with whatever we touch.
When we hold each other,
our clouds combine:
suddenly we are hot,
kicking off the covers.

Ambitious,
it rises above its source --
ourselves or the furnace
in the cellar. A wedge
of warm air eases

up the stairwell,
as determined
in its migration as geese
in theirs;
nestles in the point
of the ceiling.

The primary source
is the spendthrift sun.
Our floating particle, the earth,
inherits a merest fraction
of the sun's largesse.
It is a magnificent
allowance. Ask

the old woman in the solarium, humming to her cat.

The need to keep our temperature
within a narrow range of comfort
affects the shapes
we call culture:
buildings, clothes are made
to protect or dissipate the warmth
within them. Hats, even; rooftops:
riding above a person or town
like accent marks above a line of letters,
they are as much the language
as their bearers.

Heat lingers about our heads,
halos for mortals.

Forced to give us up, it will
vacate the outermost provinces
of hands and feet,
gather in the fist
of the heart.

Sometimes we seek escape, dive
into the sea, drink iced tea in the shade
of the plane tree.
We can only modify it.
It is as easy to discard
as our lives.
Absinthes two absinthes. I did not press upon you.
A tendril, yes; confessed.
Contentedly. We ate carefully then we drank.
Two feasting forward.

Does it please you, our tendency
to keep distances between us? When we don't
look at each other we think we are closer, which
is why the gods don't watch us. The intervals
among them and you and me
are musical. I took
some last looks and now
you can resume.
A field of perfect clover: reasons
are not needed and there are several.

The flowers of wormwood are yellow or white.
The flowers of anise are yellow or else white.
Two dark green oils one
bitter one sweet. Absinthes
two absinthes. A couple is two.
One and one or
one and another
make what? Our glasses touch.
If we are dying, let's do it slowly, together.
Are dolphins ever tired?
The way we have been leaping
about the steamship Intercourse and heaving
as if it ran on our hot breaths;
the way we have been yelling
as if our lungs were bellows for the furnace
of that gentle, violent vessel;
the way we gasp and clutch each other
like drowning sailors, then die to find
another life, ourselves transformed
and kissing easily as fish or playing
like dolphins over waves,
or tossing like the waves themselves
above the sea-bed, after
having beaten around our respective and
respectable bushes
on dry land for so long --
I am turned around, not sure
if we are found or foundering.
There is a storm above the waves
and one below, but for all our
sweet struggle, the churning all around,
our sporting in the wake,
the ship appears to be more or less
on course. We sight a new world daily.
I stand where the water will part.
Only a diver or a dolphin
will see the hull from here
after the boat is launched.
The bow strokes upward, sharp
as a steeple, smoother than a sail, precise
as a mathematician's thought.

Beech leaves don't maat like oak leaves.
They stay light and whole through the winter
and now they rustle, salting spring
with an autumn sound.

This is about woods.
Hamilton is not particularly important.
It happens to be here.
It's a place I'd never heard of
until I cam here to work on a boat,
miles from the sea.
I find it good to start
from a place I don't know.

My friends in Austria were attracted
to the birch forest silvered in mist;
they got a little lost, a little happy,
wandering and talking.
Then they saw a tank. Two tanks.
And men with rifles, very still.

Your eyes look past me.
I see in them a frozen lake,
a few trees.
I want to be something to you.
The dog is out of sight;
out of hearing, elven. I want
to make a difference for you.

We look at pictures
of the boat being made.
Fiberglass in a mold, it was one piece
like a need.
Needs are vectors; they point
and push.
Wants are more diffuse,
care less about getting to the point.
They might have no point at all
or several.
Wanting is negative, something
absent, an open space.

The puncture from the thorn doesn't bleed
although it seemed deep.
Because of the beech leaves, I can hear
the dog disappear.
Trees change as we look at them.
The light between them and us
changes too.

We sand the hull cleaner.
White dust shoots from the electric sander
and drifts from handheld sandpaper,
aging us through the afternoon.
By six we are gray.

Wooden silhouettes of tanks and soldiers
were propped against trees
in the story that started
in the Austrian woods.
And then there were real soldiers,
very young, with cheerful faces,
who made sure my friends had a watch,
told them the war games
would start at two o'clock.
There would really be shooting.
They should be sure to leave.

One field away from the boat in its cradle,
the dog curls up, brown bush
among bushes.
I run a thorn hard into my finger
as I untie her.

Now you look out your kitchen window
and your hands do nothing in the sink.
You look out on the lake
that exists only at the back of your eyes.
I am walking in the woods
around the lake, meeting
the many women, men too,
who love you.

Yellow beer and the light gray trees.
The crisp shape of the hull,
primed now, white, waits for color, poised
on its stiff wooden wave, beamy
in its cradle.
And the dog runs the anchor line
around four bushes, maybe five; enough
that she can't move. I'll have to untie her.

In Provincetown we walk up a dune
that has buried the trunk and branches,
and stand at the top of a tree,
are for the moment
heavy birds, see the buds
that will open late this year
and for the last time.
The path is narrow and fenced with nettles.
Farther into the dunes,
tips of branches show
a few inches above the sand
in roundish constellations
that were leafy crowns.

Here I come. I say it
so as not to startle you
in the rooms of your quietness
where you can forget I am in the house
because you are thinking.
Solitude can be constructive,
necessary.
I have it too,
a place simply apart,
not withheld.
A cool place to swim, the water
tinged to tea
by oak leaves.
Here I am.

Deep, deep in the woods,
past loneliness, past
the part of the forest we can see at all,
the dog is lost; to us, not herself,
like a person beyond thinking.
Animals go there and don't notice.
They press through the dim green light,
their paths opening only as they pass.
I've seen waves open like that
for the keen shape of a boat
and shut again, and be the same.
There is nothing to be done about
most things.

Pardon me, but you do have
just the right amount of hair
on your chest and arms.
You are really pretty.

Baking steams my windows white.
I don't expect any one thing
to happen. I concentrate
on not wanting;
a double negative,
a space surrounding a space
like the plains upon plains
of the sea.
I havge only a few wants and
I can keep them or give them away.
I will love you as I do
certain landscapes. Shallow hills, say;
a few thickets.
Nothing alarming.
Don't be afraid.

We needed coffee.
The store was a long way back.
Dry grass stabbed our feet,
and I fell behind.
You said quietly, "I think it's best
to ignore it." I was just able
to do that. I had to work at it.

People don't make people happy.
They are or they aren't.
You don't seem to mind much
either way.
I guess it isn't particularly
important. It happens to be there
or not, like this town or that, this wave
or another. An old friend
calls all of this,
boat, dog, trees, soldiers,
he calls it
"passing the time."
So much is aimless. Her poems are
taut, high-pitched; like a scream,
yes. And she had had enough of living.
When I was fifteen, reading one of her last
poems for the first time, she was dying.
Daffodils by the thousands, bees
in their sticky houses, wax and heavy --
these could not save her.
                                      Taut, a bowstring:
the idea that tore through
her mind, as if shot from a terrible cupid --
that death would solve what marriage, what
children, had not; that women sacrifice
themselves, half-willing victims of marvelous, discreet
malevolence--magnetized a hundred troubles
to point to it: the coldest winter
in years, the electric strike's
blackouts, even the stars
pointed that way
in a mind made up,
in an instant.
                   Let us not
agree. Let us go to the Devon house next spring and see
daffodils bloom, bees swarm; skim cream
warm off blue milk, make the horses sweat
with running.
The cat's fur warms quickly;
the pads of his paws take
longer. The air he has left outside
looks damp, a layer of diffuse waves
above the dense ones in the bay.
A snowflake snaps
its complicated parts together
in my mind; the snow I think will fall soon

is already falling, invisibly high.
The cat makes himself neat
on the sofa, tucks his paws under
like a package beginning
to wrap itself. Self-contained,
he has his own weather
indifferent to the first flake
emerging from its tall cloud. Neither of us
sees it slide
down the long frozen cliff of air and melt
on the shoulder of a wave.
Cats become more visible
after a snowfall.
They pick their way through the wet streets
like old people;
they avoid the white lawns.
It has snowed for days, the double-sided waterfront
crackling with ice, ducks taking to deep water.
Snow blooms in window-boxes.
All the cats in Provincetown are sitting on fences
watching three days of snow become four.

Each flake has miles to fall, takes
hours; sometimes it flies upward in the wind.
The cat sits at the bottom of the air. Flakes
stand in his fur and do not melt.

When it is not snowing the cat watches
everything that moves.
When it snows he watches what doesn't move:
the spaces between flakes. Trees.
The spaces between trees.
When he runs into the spaces, he is still.
Streets, houses, snowflakes, people
fall past.
Husky-masked, bologna-tongued, Pfoxer
settles her bulk on the bed and props
a long jaw on the window sill
like the muzzle of a pioneer's rifle,
heavy to hold alone; pivots it
as she examines the gestures
of grass and birds. The universe,
itself created expressly for her perusal,

is putting the finishing touches
on an August dusk.
Red light slides up
shafts of grass, hesitates, then
springs; the luminous tips blink dark.
The field cools and ticks like an engine
just turned off. She scans it
not for Indians but for rabbits,
those fascinating creatures
with ears so like her own -- long, soft,
alert. Surely rabbits and she have interests
in common, issues to discuss with little fear
of disagreement! But the difficult cousins
have so far fled her well-meant attention
and all invitations to play.

She sighs. She closes her eyes and allows
her weight on this side of the fulcrum
to swing her face toward the moon
-- rabbit-light, muse to whom she sometimes
raises voice as well as nose.
I would not care to wager
that she does not register some delicate
moon-scent
in that moist, oversized chemical analyzer
that is the furthermost point of both
her physical construction
and her sensory appreciation
of the above-mentioned universe.

Her paws work in a dream. She shoots
after rabbits, or moons.

Muzzle-loader, she slams
her own dinner home; lifts
that magnificent sniffer
to consider my choice of spices
for the soup; longs to get my dinner
in her sights, too.
I agree.
The house plant plagiarizes the field of
wild flowers; imitation
is inevitable.
My mother at 27
was probably looking at her Pittosporum japonica
and talking to herself.

She married late; I was born
when she was 41. It's never too late
to put the self together
with parts of other people, to become
a piece of the world they likewise
possess.
"My daughter is . . ." she tells her friends.
"My daughter is two; she's learning to talk;
I've taught her every word she knows."

The world can continue to exist only by
repeating itself. In Magritte's Plagiarism,
made in 1960 or about twelve years after
myself, a field of flowering bushes grows
inside the silhouette of a potted plant,
species unknown but a late bloomer
no doubt. We late bloomers tend to be
self-effacing.

I have sisters. I have teachers
who are also women.
I grow up
as in a convent. The japonica
has white flowers, waxy, well
protected.

Two mirrors hang on opposite walls
of the small attic room. In one,
I see my pigtails and blue corduroy dress
in alternating front and back views
12 or 21 times
depending on what year it is
and how well I've learned to count.
The line of little girls
curves out of sight, but I'm sure
it's endless, like numbers.

It was an arrangement Tantalus could have traded
for his pears and pool
with no other gain than
a change of scenery.
Putting one eye in the proper position to see
myself multiplied ad infinitum
meant my head got in the way (I have since
found this to be the main reason
infinity remains undisturbed).
Trying to get my head out of the way
without moving my eyes
was an occupation that gave me numerous headaches
and glasses before I was five. Older philosophers
have gotten worse results
from similar exercises.

There are other mirrors.
I will fill the ungainly silhouette
of my mother's mother, the one
who showed me I would never grow up to be
a little old lady, that I will become
a large one instead.

My future still curves like the arc
of eighteen little girls
and exhibits the same perversity: leaned into, it
disappears. But now I know it is concealing
something more interesting than repetition.
It ends.
One thing the mothers and sisters and teachers
were careful not to mention
but that grandmothers boldly engaged in
as if it didn't matter what anybody said,

was dying, walking into
the empty mirror just out of sight,
darkening to a silhouette in which someone else
appears, someone familiar --
a girl running through a weedy field,
a woman watering a house plant
and muttering --
someone almost
the same.
Panes and eggs make fragile dozens:
two times six in cardboard nests, food
for angels who eat cake; three
times four the membrances between weathers.
Frames hold themselves in wooden hugs
that keep the world together, the glass
a cubist with twelve angles on what is:
peach tree; sea flexing; perhaps a house
being painted blue. Here, a Q:

a british line. A dozen people
wait to buy beer in the sculpture garden.
English sparrows and leaves also
stand in lines together, higher
than the humans. Big plants
digest sunlight and rumble in their juices.
People through the queue sit
to tea-cakes and quiches
at tables made of metal imitating
lace: ornate with curlicues,
the iron legs are painted white
as eggs. Dozens of dozens of windows
surround the lines of this and that:
the museum looks out, and in, 
at its informal center. The courtyard

a disordered game board:
tables white squares, flagstones grey, both
scattered crazily. Couples
play hearts everywhere. Queens and
pawns and wandering knights take cues.
Jokers coin jingles
and wink. Second fiddles
fiddle with their drinks. And hundreds
of visions of the light touching things
pass through the tiny panes of eyes each
instant.

Hands hold the light up
as they gesture, conducting
conversations. When
the people in the garden talk, they are
what they say. When they are quiet
their bodies are maps of the cosmos,
hands five-pointed stars. Fish dive in the blue
streaks of their arms, angels rise
in their smiles.
Rings and bracelets flash like waves
landing, waves fragile
as glass, as white shells washed ashore.
Gulls sit about with straight faces
as though they were not surprised
to walk on water, as though
they were here the last time
the bay froze, a hundred years ago.
They rise and squawk and fight
above the floes or ride them
in neat lines; as smart, in their white
uniforms, as miniature
midshipmen.
                    They should review
their charts, for half the fleet
lies jumbled on the beach--great blocks
like broken numbers dropped
from some celestial computation
rounded off.
                    These
grand pianos, polar bears, salt
barges, the sea's spare syllables
packed in ice--all have a second shadow:
melting, they etch their images
into the beach.
                       Surely
after their sailing drills are over
sea birds study the prints
of dark and prodded sand, short
-lived fossils of a slight
ice age; for recognizing the instant
at which drip and drip and drip combine
to fix a figure in the sand
is an exercise for mystics, the reverse
of seeing through a rainstorm to
its single drops, through
a rising flock
to its composite flights.

The beached hulls are shoulder high
but sinking, unbuttoning their gray crystals
one by one and loosing them, carelessly,
like small talk; dissolving, topside,
into mist.
               Here you and I
are rudly upright figures; we walk
among the non-commissioned battleships
on which the warm air has designs
of reducing to row-boats; look, we are
strung with them along an abacus
-- with these gull-crews, ice-boats,
this watery slip of a globe,
we are sliding toward a sum

who yet work our own passages
through the wheeling world.

She is an angel lounging
on a stringy cloud, unleavened
cirrus.

Trees hang above her, their globy tops
bushy stars on stalks.
The leaves are busy with
all kinds of commerce and curious
emergencies -- green flares go off,
and smallish gongs; there are raucous
goings-on in the palisade layers
where pairs of cells dance between the columns
and odd ones idling along the fibrous walls
look out through leaf-pores
at constellations of leaves,
galaxies of trees. Waiters circulate
with drinks, and wiry insects perform
skating tricks and acrobatics on the waxy decks.
A party! The leaf manufactures
streamers and lights and sweet liqueurs
from the cranky air.

Though she lies lazy as a land mass
between the hammock's polar regions,
nothing within her precincts
is still: while some cells, of quiet
disposition, tend the elevators
of respiration, others drive sports cars wildly
through the tumbling blue traffic
of the blood, or jockey trucks of produce
about the stomach rumblingly; some dash
along nerve paths with telegrams
and holler out Halloo -- halloo --
                                                     She is
a red leaf! suspended between
the stout stems of trees and linked
to the living commotion
by the subtle twig of breath, that
ether
her mind has ridden on for years
like a flock of grey birds circling,
a school of planets swimming.
Perfectly black coffee in a white perfect cup, this
is simpler than flowered towels. The loom of course
makes its own arrangements, adding to line
histories of line, condensing
movement over time
into the short time it takes to see.
The thinking line is design.
Blooms.

Two chinese horses in a carpet.

Two chinese houses amid dim stems.

In the middle of the page is a photograph of a giraffe.
In the gazette, gazelles appear as paragraphs.

We make our rooms by hand: gestures create
the objects around them. The coffee as I mentioned.
Crockery. The stems.
A few vegetables and chairs.
The door is open a crack that is ajar.

He didn't raise hand or voice.

A stone jar smoothes with use. Useful.
An open door is empty.

A man we hadn't seen in years.
His changes made his sameness strange:
he moved us
to another room            out of doors.

A door that is opened isn't one:
a space instead.

A porch has insight like a bay window a glass boat or
bottled water. Inside
the plants consider, we sit with them;
they contain themselves. The broad
shadows of leaves make continents on the floor boards.
An english ivy, a boston fern:
we carry them off the verandah in their pots.
Wide and green, a port.

An open door is not one or two but through.
Openness brought by a stranger we knew.

Out of doors an open room.
A pair of donkeys on a red road.
A pair of pairs.
We think the monks are strong like geometry.

How many yellow robes
how many hours.

One in a row.

They sleep parallel like brothers like trees.
They often work in rows
in the hall
    the garden
by the fish
pond, they raise doves in a Roman ruined tower.
To what power does one raise a dove.

Doves are distinguished by pointed tails.
In the dovecote a coterie. a distinguished group.
Doux
doux
doux
the monks have a few for dinner however. A coup.

It is good that what they say disappears like food
or like a beautiful old father.
Shaping pots, weaving cloth: what they make
is plain. Their flowers are in their garden.

Foxglove. The figure of

a dove facing a fox is pointed at both ends.
They have no use for foxes; a brace
of pheasants is preferred.
They raise honey bees as well in the alcove,
the oldest part of the wall.
Their will is very old. They and we
arrange straw for bees in niches some of which are
occupied also by stone saints.
The bees are particular since
the straw creates their cloisters.

Finally we forget what we are carrying and do not
make mistakes.

a poem
the size of  my
diaphragm     closing
out     all     germs     sperms
and loving     from my womb
sealing         growing          off
making         our         act
end  when  we
begin

this     is     not     a     trick
i think of my sex life
as         an         intensified
m i  c r o c  o s m
of  the  world  outside
The snide remark you
may     have  made  not
withstanding             there
are  no  truths     greater
t o  m e  t h a n   those
proven         in     the          hay
o n  m y  own  b o d y
So much of poetry depends
on keeping legs crossed
at the right moment 
but whether at my knee
or your neck 
that
is the question.

*

Don't waste time
wondering when our paths
   or legs will cross.
They won't or if they do
   it won't be because
   of a promise
   in a poem.
With high heels that place my ass
prick level     like a cat
in heat stretching out her toes
to accommodate whoever comes
and curled hair to remind you
of what it feels like
down there     I wet my lips
in labial readiness
shade my eyes for that overwhelmed
orgasmic look
and say
I dress up
to appear
presentable.
"God!" said the young poet
when he entered my bathroom,
"So many creams!" And there they were
on the shelf by the mirror:
cleansers and cottonwool, tonics
and softeners, tweezers, pencils
and shadows. "And I loved
your selflessness -- your body unaware:
you must spend hours on this."

I might have quoted Yeats
but shied of discovering
artistry. Once I too
had been shocked
when a wise mentor confided
her body was her pride
and she exercised long and hard
for the look of the aesthete.

This is no vanity of women:
my father powdered his face
to hide his beard in the afternoon
and the ladies revered
his wise innocence.

I too admired
but I knew
about the powder.

Do you suppose you
could love me despite
the creams despite
Adam's curse
or worse
because of it?
A crooked, close-mouthed smile
(I know that smile
gingivectomies make us hide
our new long teeth)
in a wistful crooked face.
(Your left eye wanders;
it must have taken years
to focus on the A B C
and no one knew   thought you
a problem child.

You seem
so demure
(but not demure enough
to cover what you knew
you could be).   How did you bear
those loves that damned you
for so long?
If you'd given them up
let yourself be named
"Bitch"   with no hope
of husbands, children, a split-
level dream  no plans
for professorships, sanity,
the love
of the right people:
could you have stirred your cauldron

and stayed free
from your summer hote1?

Would you have been here
to let me
take an open-mouthed snapshot
of you?
To strangers on the street
we were women: They could see
protruding from caressing sweaters
breasts riper than their bearers 
wills tugging whole bodies
passively, unknowingly behind 

The men from the factory windows
cheered as we passed by
and we passed by
for their cheers
walking a naive dog every day.  They
knew more than we
of what our bodies could don
"Jeannie and me"
knew only the joys
of an afternoon stroll
passing by
strangers in the street.
 Through the plexiglas shield you
 can see her quite clearly  nude body
 writhing against the exposure.
 The chair, the bed, the toilet are all
 transparent and there
 are no covers, no protection
 from curious eyes, from the crowd
which has come to see
the sentence carried out
 for failure to fulfill
the promises of voluptuous flesh.
She shrieks
but her mouth distorts its loveliness
needlessly since we
can hear nothing not even
the fingernails that scrape
the plexiglas.

When she sleeps, her legs
wrap around each other,
yet darting movements under eyelids
reveal her secret dreams.

Mostly she shades her face
with long hair and fingers
and rocks on slender knees.

But she refuses to eat, the keeper says,
in hope that once thin
the sin of seduction will no longer
stick. The trick
is to lose all beauty
and yet remain
alive. The line
is fine: To be released
while wasted flesh still throbs.
My thickened ankles at this time of the month
remind me of Mother

I don't hate her anymore

A sudden secret exploded in the midst
of an argument

My child and I don't really talk

No clothes suit her body
lengthening into my shape

Inherited flaws shame her

How long it takes
forgiveness

When the sin is within
Self

2.  Optician -- adjust lenses
3.  Dentist
But the man who is known to wear
a white jacket
to cover
wild curlicues of hair
is absorbed in the cracking
of a tooth
of a woman not much older
than I
and I have read
All the English magazines
and have leafed through
the Spanish
and have thus been committed
to the whiteness of the waiting room.
And the protean lips of my mind
open suddenly and release
beckoning heat.
I shudder in the joining
with it n But let my tongue
meander through its bone
and membrane
the widening and tapering shapes
dripping



from above
forming
vaginal folds, coral
in their promise.
The white door opens.
Oh, let me enter farther

Not enough
not enough they say.  The list
is too short and the dreams
disproportionate  My mother
would agree, and the children
are fighting again,
so that I will turn
from the window and look at them.
And there
I remember
Lunch.  Margarine
in a pan schnitzel
and salad and the song
of the stalactite cave
comes back Bach
sings straight up
from the floor
and I melt
down to meet him
in the redness the spike of which
I remember
from the waiting room.  Hear...
and I poured
the juice on the floor.

My slippers will have to be

Where would a poet be
without lists of things
to do? -- no ideas
but in frames, lists, theories
to escape...
Our flesh remembers its loneliness
from the day
and will not let
the night join us.
Though we lie naked
and open like spoons
under one warm cover
I will awaken
afraid.

*

All there is to know
of love
I learned
from your back.

*

To wake up each morning to a murder.

Stale air from wrinkled sheets.

Don't roll over and open your eyes.

Too many bloodstains to begin a day.
I am thinking of you and watching this fly thinking of eating
lunch on the backstairs and waiting to be taken to dinner thinking
of writing you the truth and scribbling
a poem
instead
moves out from vulture shoulders
craning round a perfect face
to smile at me.

I am
no longer carrion, have
pinched myself alive
yet quiver in sudden grace
each time that perfect face
smiles down at me.
wrong, pushed me to the wall when
I needed soft holding,
defended yourself in the mirror
while I licked my wounds,
fucked without your mouth
your eyes I was not wise
and thought you didn't care
now I know you loved me
unaware.
We're on the bed  she lies
under the covers, and I
sit on the edge, sorting threads
from the sewing box.
"Tell me about your lover," I say.

She is sleepy and speaks in blurs
but loves
to relive his flesh in words:
"His body's silky, like a girl' s 
slender and soft and kind,
gentle the way my husband
should have been."

She reaches for my hand
and sleeps.  I leave, weeping
for what love
could be, knowing
what I would have done
had I been he.
"You drive all right," the dentist says,
"I drove behind you all the way
And you didn't make 
A single mistake."

I know only
That I began at home
And ended here,
In your office, in your chair.

I was thinking about
How I'm going to get myself a style
That will show the whole of me. 
There's a hole in my daughter's thigh
Climbing a fence, she was impaled,
And I lifted her off the spike

Now on the table,
The surgeon breaks open the foil package
And she asks, "Will it hurt?"
He is tired of questions
"Just shut up and don't move"
He barks at my little girl.

"All right. I'll think about something else."

I nudge her, "Orit, how do you feel?"
"Quiet! I'm thinking about something else." 
Strange to have exotic blooms
In this tiny flat  the rented couch with faded
Red roses  bare stone floors
I sleep on a child's mattress
And dream of my wars.

Into this austerity of divorce
Comes a rich suitor, the old fashioned kind.
Tiger lilies and birds of paradise fill
The empty room. Vases and diamond
Earrings, candies and a toy horse.

When the gifts come
I tip the boy and count what's left

Enough
For milk this week? 
Dina takes notes at a lecture
The professor sits, thighs spread,
Telling his plans for research.

I watch the way his body moves
The fat, I'm sure, is recent.
He must be athletic. Does he still play
Around? He would like to, I conclude,
If just to feel
Love,
Warmth of a girl.

After, Dina has a lot of questions,
Some even impressive. I want to ask
If his wife is good in bed, if
He dreams of dying young, 
If he wakes at night afraid
He won't manage to pay
His children's tuition.

I wait in the corner
Until my chance
Has passed.

"You hide your light
You're always quiet
Why didn't you ask a question?"
This from a technician
Who has recorded the session
For television.
"It would have been
For your good
To be seen
To be heard."

I was off
In a different world
My eager questions
Would have been absurd.
The loom unwove while I slept...

Though I wanted it finished, decided, one
suitor selected, even if it meant
the world would topple
tomorrow  the tapestry
would be a tight weave
with a brown
border so that nothing
could escape. I have not the heart
to start again.

 *
There is danger
here
in these depths
that are too soft
too warm.
There is danger.
We may never emerge
forever be lost
never return
to our homes.
Arachne, weaving at the window,
lifts her head and looks at me.

Maiden light, sombre as a crone,
her tambour web glistens in the sun.

"Better than your de Kooning,
I would have been
an emblem for women
centuries from now.

"But you, jealous like Athena,
goddess of your household
alone,
plan even now,
the destruction of my art."

Who says this place is falling apart?
I think I'll sit down and string
a poem from my bowels.

Leave spring cleaning
for another day.

A different start.
It' s the old craftsmen that make it through.
I have thought about this a lot sitting in my chamber
with my powdered wig askew  white stuff
sprinkled on my shoulders, petticoat stained,
pimples, billet-doux, blotting grains
messing up the paper, the poems, the lines
while that obsessive little dwarf climbs
to the top. Each time he writes a verse  Swift sighs,
wishes it his.  God, my life is such a mess,
and I have to show it  not just on my dress.
I want what' s on the page to be as pungent
to the nose as I am when I can't get myself together
for the ritual of ablutions. the rites of Pride.

What is all this fuss about form? 
Maybe Pope' s verse will outlive that little
hungering wonder of a gnome. But it won't
have a damn thing to do with him 
like when you leave fragments of your statue in the desert
so people will assume you were quite a man.

Crafty truth is an oxyrnoron.

Come, lets go to the bathroom 
I want to show you something.
It never ends...
You break with a snakeskin lover
crawling, only looking forward
to a fresh pact, a clean
blackboard.

But it's not a test:
 pass-fail.
No amount of examination avails
to know
for sure
that it couldn't have been better
with him.
Four fingers in the fob pocket of my jeans
the tail of my suede jacket moving
with my fast walk  high boots clacking

on the broken sidewalks of old Tel Aviv
(cloth bag heavy with books sways from my shoulder)
on my way to an office with a patterned stone floor 
high walls lined with books on self-help,

the Holocaust    Nancy Drew    and the poems of my friends 
narrow arched windows in a rounded wall
the paint on the outside mottled from many layers

many peelings: an office for the Turkish police chief
once now a publisher I am on my way
here now on a clear fall day
when every detail every ornament of this
convoluted city is part of an arabesque
a single line forming
a perfect design.
This is just a grove
you told me and the fruit
no sweeter than those you can buy on the street
but here we can sit
beneath the lemon tree its sweet acridity
reminding us of other groves
earlier springs
on the wall of your skin at night,
Say, prisoner, let me in.  You scratch your leg
as if only you could tend to your itch.
I grope for your latch to near you gently
but all my hands touch is too rich to skim
and I cannot rest with just fingertips.

Where are your dreams, what
is your heart?  When it seems
that you start in your sleep
and your soft breath moves
from deep to fast pants,
how can I move with your dance?
A rainbow flies in his wake
each time he slaloms starboard.
I lean against the windscreen back
and cannot take away my eyes.

Aboard the ancient fishing boats
brown faces turn up from their nets,
smile at the moving halo of spray.

I have vowed not to cross men
with gods.  Yet as he holds
to the tow.
easy on the water
when my hands
would long have given out 
glowing, alone
with the early-morning fishers

I would pass my bread
to him
to cast


Here

now
I'm so glad we're not virgins
Or have to pretend ignorance,
Decorum.  I mean you know and I know
We've been through or seen or dreamed it all.

Look, I've given birth
Facing an open door to a busy hallway
Split the front of my dress before an audience like you,
Said the very thing I was afraid I'd say, promised not 
to say
(And heard about it from my aunt the very next day), 
shamed
My parents, and my children,
Time and time again
And lived through it all
And confess it all
And laugh.

What pretensions to propriety could I have?

And you you've heard this kind of thing before
Maybe not here, not from me
But how different can what you've lived or will live be
From what I know or will
So we can relax treat one another like cats
Who smell impersonally, affectionately
The private parts of guests.
Sometimes sex is an excuse to touch...
I dip my lips in the multicolor
wonder of your hair -- here soft
like underfur of kittens,
there like briars to my cheek.

My fingers probing feel
the softness of your skin
and we begin
and there is nowhere for me
to be
but into you
into me
I sit in the middle of the bed
look up to your face
down to your feet

Like cotton wool like snow
you lie
and allow me
to make of your quiet
what I will
If you stop me in the middle of anything,
and ask: "What would you rather be doing?" --
"Fucking" slips out before I think of the question

Though I have crawled out of bed boneless
only seconds before, would probably not even know
what was being done to me, so numb from sensation.

You say it' s an escape or a metaphor    for intensity,
contact.  Teaching, talking, performing at peak
does just as well.  Think of all the pricks
You've turned down.  I sigh.  It wasn't the sex,
I didn't like, but the men 
anyway, that was when
I was young, and didn't know what really counted
in this world.  The fine thing about screwing 

Is that it is always good.  Anything else
you take a chance.
There are signs in the morning -- hairpins,
stains.  Once I even found a jacket
pressed between the seat and the back door.
I left it there, and then it was gone.

On my way to work, I think of them meeting
in my car at night,
the only shelter from parents or mates  
This little love nest
I leave unlocked. 
The soldiers would come
into my grandmother's yard
pull the head off a chicken
and thrust it into her hand

Cook it    woman

The Russian soldier  the German
then
the Russian again 
The morning fills with the chime of the Glockenspiel 
...
delighted tourists lift their eyes
at eleven sharp to see
painted brass knights joust to the music,
Bavarian dancers spin on their toes.

I look down when they look up
hoping to trap some truth in smiling eyes. 
As if the museums had not filled me
and a good stein of beer not quite
what I needed right now
we continue in the late afternoon
to search for Koenigsplatz.

I can't remember its name
only that Thomas had once 
brought us through, on some
rainy day we were en route.

He didn't have to identify
this place here
I was no naive visitor.

I saw a man standing on the stairs,
his salute answered by a mass
of radiant soldiers
looking up all in tune.

I blinked
and a slim blond girl was roller-skating
in an empty square
alone. 
"I do not perceive my individual existence
apart from racial identity,"
I hear myself say two months after
I've returned to Tel Aviv. 
The blond Englishman in the beige raincoat
encircles the Jewess with his arm
whilst strolling on cobbled Getreidegasse
between the show windows and the shoppers
and asks her why she lives in Israel.
                                                      She
covers a fierce warmth that wells
with    "I have no choice

"Born like you in London, but of survivors,  
raised with the ghosts of all destroyed
the aunt beheaded in the forests,    the grandmother 
you can fit
in an ashtray,    the whole    gallery some whose fate 
remains unsure
I must live in a land where I make the rules."

The arm
draws tight
protective
"But that 
shan't happen again.
How can you
believe it of us?"

Getreidegasse becomes Judengasse,

we enter a shop
where thick-braided salesgirls
disdain to show their wares.
To my question "Why is this called
ëJudengasse' when there are no Jews here?" 
they stare blankly.

Back home I warm 
to the Englishman
I kept at such a distance
in the twisting alleys
of Salzburg.  I clap
a souvenir from him on my car window. 
He
does not write. 
As announcements of funerals drone on
like a class list at the university,
Yoram frowns at the BBC sticker on my windshield:
"Did you hear what those assholes are saying- -
Israeli aggressors?  They defend England
by bombing halfway around the world,
but we can't stop the Katyushas
from destroying our kids."

I think of you, Glynne, in your beige raincoat,
and me, that apologetic, stubborn Jewess at your side.
"I am not against Zionism,  you understand,  but
a country born in blood
must expect
to live in blood." 
Near Mozart's birthplace, young Tom,
your urbane colleague from the broadcasting service,
told me:  "It doesn't matter now
whether we should be in Falklands.
Now 
We'd just better win."

You were a boy
when I was born,
both of us 
in the Blitz. 
Now a white-and-blue 707
flies overhead towards Lod, and I think:
what if it brought you here,
what if you could see me
checking people's bags as they enter the school
making packages for soldiers at the front,
calling every friend with a man or boy up north,
spinning the dial for more
more news 

Would I be the romantic Jewess
or the racist one? 
Skyhawks fly over my city
on their way to bomb yours.
We are awakened by the noise
and I fall asleep restlessly
dreaming of you and your daughters.

"If anything happens to my girls,
I hold you personally responsible."
April 25. Israel is bombing Beirut.
You and I stick to wine with our
lamb casserole in Cyprus
and discuss politics.

Spinning the dial now from BBC
to the Israel Army Channel 
I don't know what to believe.
The thin voice of an 18-year-old soldier
telling how a Lebanese
kissed him when he jumped out
of his tank, is muddled with the British
accents of the newsmen estimating
half a million homeless
in southern Lebanon.

Minutes after the cease-fire in Beirut
CBS photographs antiaircraft fire
from a small apartment building.
(Is that where you live? Then 
who lives with you?) The Skyhawks
go down on the city again.

Friend! My husband is in civil defence
and my sons are too small for the army. You
have daughters and are old and alcoholic.
We can't fight this war.
But both of us are in it
and responsible. 
Not a day goes by without my thinking of you...
as in a clandestine affair I am reminded
by the newspapers, the sounds in the air,
that you are there, and I in Tel Aviv.

Today brings a letter, postmarked Princeton,
sent through Jounieh to Larnaca on its way here.
You are well, as of the sixteenth of July, 1982, 
and today is the 30th. Last night
on the news, we were still pounding the city.

As long as we kept from politics, we were friends
strolling together down the sea road in an Austrian town,
shocking the guide with our nationalities
and talking Pound, sex, divorce, food, wine.

How our lives would be fine
now, if that was all there was
to talk of.  But where we live
we speak only of death and think
of somewhere else. 
Our portion is a porch 
a side room with two small, curtained windows
opening into the synagogue.
We, who meet at the pool in bikinis,
sit modest and kerchiefed
humbled to our place

And listen.  There are no books,
so I cannot review
the chapter of the week
or follow my son's bar mitzvah reading.

Standing around the Torah,
joining in turn in the service 
each man has his honor
as he welcomes a new member.

When my son completes his prayer,
we women will throw candies
from behind closed curtains.

I find my place next to a crone
who shares the book she has brought from home,
and, as she points to each word,
cries with joy "So lovely this chapter
such luck to be able to read this portion."

She compares my boy to hers
killed in the war,
and tears spot the page.
Sitting in the closed-off porch,
candies in both hands,
I weep with her.
Here a few poems,
there a few tears 
what more do you need
to give shape to your life?

*
To divide
is difficult.
You close me
and we know
that you are
after all
in your own book,
I in mine.

Entry: 0637 The Orion Notebooks 
Someone in the Main Office 
did you in. 
Someone in the dead elm. 
Now all day the aluminum spoon chirps 
in the knapsack. 
It's time you left this place. 
This table is a cup
he lifts, 
a receptacle of 
weights & measures/ 
proportions 

Without it he cannot 
know 
his own hands from 
the ink a printer mixes 
with water 

the right proportions 
or lines 
will grey-out 
in the poem 
                   He knows

the yellow cake 
he likes 
the chocolate frosting rich 
with butter 
    his mouth knows 
    more 
than tablespoons 
of shortening, & flour/ 
cups of it 
                spacing

his wife's 
day 
               Till with his hand he cups

her chin, lifts 
to mix 
her mouth with his 

This woman is the table 
of his life 
This poem is a photograph 
to save Lois 
in her floor-length dress asleep 
on the bed 
with the kitten, Julep & 
Brandy, the mother 
on the floor 

her dress is red 
& the candle 
                    snuffed
in the kitchen 
the pork-chop bones & 
apple skins 
on the greasy plates 

the sauterne bottle 
in the dim light from the dining room 
casts a green 
shadow 
across the table 

                         outside the window limbs

& branches 
sing 
with the wind 
A robin working 
the fresh -- 
cut lawn 
in front of the Oldsmobile 
blood-red 
on the gravel drive 

splits 
a worm 
with its beak & 
takes half 
down 
          flies off
the rest for its 
mate 
or young 

the hopped-up Chevy 
57 
swerving up 
over the 
curb down 
burning rubber away to 
miss 
the tow-head kid on a skateboard 

brings back the red 
& brown 
the tail 
on the freeway 
the long brown 
twitching 
chocolate-point Siamese 
To the chittering 
small huddle of 
warm fur 
that didn't make it across the freeway 

I leave the hard-bound journal 
I never wrote in 
To begin he remembers green 
Iowa hills 
speckled orange 
with Tiger Lilies, 
land his mind stretched, hands 
trembling with 
the wheel, 
road breathing beneath. 

The cracks repeat the names of love. 

A flock of farm pigeons 
breaks above 
the windshield, now joins in 
the mirror, pulling 
to the new sun 
the last 
of the suffocating Iowa night. 
Driving across Nebraska 
my wife pulls into a Rest 
Area to 
hit me . she hits me 

It is she claims 
for all those times 
I should 
have hit her & 
didn't 

A bruise along my forearm a purple 
weed 

I bite her ear- 
lobe/ 
         twist
between her breaths 
a blade 

aeons old 
Evil dogs us 

We desire that this be beautiful 
that we 

go beyond the chill fringe 

Thigh- 
flesh glistens our 
minds flood 

We have stalked time 
to whirl upon 

to create 
for this moment 
one scent of hyacinth 

over the hills 
Indian Paintbrush 
in the cool 
valleys 
rev 
their slim engines 

Mountain freshets enunciate your name 

Your life long 
a tethered dream has 
crouched 
beneath your shoulders 

& now the wind knots 
your muscles 
to its heart 

& sunlight sucks dry 
your blame 
Heavy scent of spring grass 
passing below 

Sun 

& she behind me warm 
to my back 
our buttocks bare to the horse's flesh 

No cities 
no dream 
we are this naked beast 
making space for our living in these hills 

We move 
unto each other 
& are the syllables of sunlight 

singing 
A rainbow 
sifts 
about our heads 
on this butte, 
the stone 
ecstatic 
with lichens 

Birds buffet in flight 
with our eyelids 

A lone sheep 
an odor 
over the rocks 
pulls roots from our blood 
with its teeth 

& ruminating 
slowly 
we dissolve 
Peach blossoms drowsy 
in their curves 
dark branches 
like teeth 

Floating, the slight 
breeze 
of the wings, cool 
on your cheek, the hummingbird's 
tiny bill slips deep 
for the fluid 

Tall grass dancing, sun 
off fox fur 
reddish-gold, 
the young rabbit jerks 
as the entrails pull free 

Early evening a warm bath 

Night approaching 
a curtain of tongues 
Flesh traps 
rigid 
this winter mettle 

shrieks 

too late 
to protect 
split 
the roost 

the fox 
untrapped 
blood of white chickens 
hot 
frothing behind its eyes 

feathers new snow 
over the hill 
This is Idaho. 
Drive through 16 miles of 
muddy, pot-holey spring roads 
to this frozen lake, 
pine-cloaked basin 
below the mountain. 

Is this God's country? 
Is that Him up there, lonely 
on man-fragile skis 
cutting slow zigs 
down the slope? 
There's somebody up on that mountain! 

No. The deep black eyes 
of empty oil drums 
say no. There's 
no one. 
This is Idaho. 
Throbbing 
deep 
in the damp 
cellar 

corroded 
green 
brass-rim 
spectacles 

smeared 
milky 
with death 
I trace 
with my pen 
a seven 

someone else 
has written 
& wonder 

seven wives 
or children 
or geese 

seven billiard 
balls 
or clues 

or seven 
graceful ways 
to die? 
It is her pale 
knees 
going to water I love 

when I say her father 
has died 
& there is hope for us 
To father, who asked, 
I say we've gathered these years 
to learn the adequacy 
of caprice. 

Our lives follow the goat 

& this vitality is as much of horror 
as we deserve. 

We will be responsible. 
Where there is beauty 
there is not defeat. 

Between tribe & estrangement 
we sink into the grasses 
with the horses feeding 
& brushing the flies away. 

We hold for some moments 
what will never change. 
There is something 
ugly 
in you, active 
as a transistor 
buried below the hills 
of Duluth. 

Who could love you 
if they knew? 

Who would stay 
in the same room? 

Survival is not beautiful. 

The evil of a child 
is delicious 
& continues. 
Pungent. Thick. 

Your movements are shaped 
by the basic forms 
of death. 
You rehearse 
with each breath. 

Your genius kills 
like a deer 
& is your best. 

This is glory. 
This is home. 

You're welcome here. 
A young woman is lying naked 
on the sand. 
Her clear eyes beckon 
the sky. 
Like a gem revolved slowly in the sun 
her thoughts make love 
to light. 
Pleasure hovers over the beach 
like prayer. 
Mrs. Place 
& Mrs. Place's sister 
Mrs. Smith 
make rugs. 
Rag rugs. 

There's more to this. 

Mary 
& Mary's man- 
friend Gary 
weave & build 
& feed the dogs. 

Joy is willed. 

Lois steers the Craft Shop 
& rocks her husband's 
boat -- he cracks 
his cradle leer & bails 
the water in. 

Her tie-dye treads his calm. 
His poems make her swim. 
Crossing quickly 
with no grace 
the summer courtyard torn 
by machines 
for improvement 

the fat girl smiles 
toward his window 
                              the peaches
in her basket 
nudging each other with her steps 

She means to tell him 
she too has scented fur 
beneath her belly 

& his bed would be a kindness 
she could forgive 

The peaches are bruised 
& she is not beautiful 

but they make good 
in the world 
this morning 
Squat rectangle rounded 
at the corners 

smudged black with rubbings 
makes time 
to be 

To touch its strange surface 
my time grows 

The thought I leave 
supports 
itself 

till snakes of soft rubber 
writhe off 
words 

dissolve 

our time 
comes 
Dip your pains 
in yellow paint 

Sell daisies on street corners 

Kiss her before it's 
down, 
she'll spend the night with you 

Are we together? 
Don't mistake the moment 
for Nature 

Fertile grass 

The deserved joy 
of brooks 

Isn't this a party 

& when we try, it's simple to go 
deep 
into daylight 
You dare intrude 
This land is 
A brave man needs 
    support 
Your woman is a trip 
    to the beer tent 
Piecemeal & warm 
Her firm globes bespeak learning 
Speed 
Breed for God 
From a grassy knoll 
Correspondence with an orangutan 
May the best man grin 
    till he becomes the epileptic 
    in the first row 
Keep tracking 
The whisper 
    between oak root 
    & rock 
Becomes a third party 
Lovingly. 
A milky translucent oval 
she clutches between 
her lips. Downy. "Cough" 
he said. 
No, 
       the sunlight lazy through gauze curtains. 
A passion without dust. 

"Sew me to your trousers." 

Whalebone. Shell. Do fake pearls 
make the best buttons 
for white blouses? 
Deep red 
of polished wood 
like tiny overturned bowls 
the swollen nipples. 

"Sew me to your mouth." 
Who left the green umbrella 
in 305? 
Who filled the ashtray 
with damp oats? 
Some young lady is humming 
toward marriage, 
her cautious petals 
still pressed 
between her Bible. 
Now three angels of metal 
bring gusts 
to the classroom. 
Three angels of musk. 
We must sing praise 
to the fields, praise to the fickle hammers 
pinging in our ears. 
We must touch those petals, 
must soften & swell 
with our lips. 
Then she will whisper "thank you, 
thank you for this." 
The glow of her face 
will lift like radar, will rise 
with pleasure 
between the columns 
of rain. 
The cat's tail 
matted 
with tiny particles of digested Kal-Kan beef 

beats time 
with my jaw-knuckles 

while my wife's 
nipples 
keep slipping 

into song 
In a song about Welfare 
I see my children 
by the thousands 
as tiny bubbles in fresh bread. 

Each chimes its own shiny note. 

I would like to eat your music, I say, 
& do. 
A 43-year-old sturgeon pokes fun 
at my pink heels. 
I've mastered the secret 
of water I say, 
the one we call "buoyancy". 
He giggles through his spongey gills. 

As I drift lower I notice 
the absence of flies 
& a delightful increase in humidity. 
A subtle purring reaches 
my ears, "sweet". 
It's the unruly dogs 
in the audience, she sighed, 
& we knew it to be the truth. 

In a kind of pastel exasperation 
we settled back to watch 
the seasonal march of the PhD's, 
the swamp water rushing in 
over the tops of their waders. 

Not even the bloodhounds follow them there! 

It's time we got hold 
of a parts manual, & a set 
of Japanese tools -- there's something wrong 
with the applause. 
We left the hooters 
on the bus. No telling how fast 
they might go on foot. 

"Up the rpm's!" 

We could still hear them, 
though we were separated by miles 
of rancid pork. 
The trail-boss was a re-cap, 
the cook a cop. 

At last, as we six gathered around 
the counter-sunk urn 
weighting missiles of spittle with phlegm, 
the hungry blonde whispered 
"I am the one 
who got the red bean." 

Her faith had won. 
We still 
the rocking motion 
the brain depends on 
the heart 

We bring patience 
from within 

The sense of novelty 
which fools the lungs 
to breath 

Come home dear Priscilla 
we need your hunger 

The dance the parson wept for you 
has come to right 

We call our nights the Parson Dance 

We call your novelty 
to make the little spin 
we feel within a certainty 

Strung through 
The pivot comes loose 

We quick behind the glaze 
Across the city
of Tiahuanaco
across ttme
my cipher seeks you

who've spent the sacred
Mayan nights
editing the Bible
who predicted correctly
the Book of Aluminum found on Mars

when are you coming home?

The children grow lonely
& down my dreams
the scarred dolphins shriek.
We are the assassins
of consensus.
Our laughing drags behind
the shards of life's coherence. Do unto
other realities.
Do unto your wife.

An awkward surge in the sentence purifies
this hesitation's interface.

Our quickening length
the immaculate
forgives death our passage,
& the moody region's terrorists.

Here our sex glances
like an off-rhyme

jigging the astral body.
Evanescent, she said. It's you,
lying on the couch, your naked limbs
illuminating the room. You are
sleeping, & with each slow breath
arises the body taking you away. Now,
below me, what is left of this world
enters me & stays. We are single &
together, what we have that touches
holds continuous & warm in a basin.

Reason is no enemy -- too cold & weak,
it incites no fear. Here all movement bends
toward center, & our delicious stasis
tugs out & spreads. This is the space that has
no negative, that owns all &
earns each moment our freedom. A sphere
recording its future as it grows.
Just beginning now an
order of event
reverses separate movements to this new & simple
dance -- a knitting,
a fabric of limbs,
night warms at the heart of our whirling.

Light now, it's light we
emit, & this
energy the center of the universe.
A certain amount of room to cross

the galaxy
recording us & our

utensils

the holes
our coins make

smaller the

arc of egg shell the minds kin
The pubic fur longs to be flesh

to know
the unsettling

Laughing pierces the durable
& is itself

You will meditate
for velocity

You will be The Astronaut
& at the center
like a crystal fist
we discovered the gland
inventing
the universe

You should have brought
the shovel
back. You know
we have trouble here.
The water's taken ill.
Your mother weeps her nights away
too. She fills our lunch sacks
with last week's rain.
And a kind of blue wart has killed
the peonies. It's your
backyard. The sand-box
is failing -- your father drank the sand.
You should have come home.
We need the shovel
Jack.
To Bernice of
the graceful pauses
I leave my metal crutches.
To her guppy
a bit of tripe.
My pulling out alive
will remain for Charles, his wife will have
my softest wen. And to the University,
where mother came to bone,
the jellied hum.
The aliquot of slaughter
will stroke the children to weep
for translucence.
To them I leave the crate.
Born of bafflement
before the ways we turn
to nothing,
born of substantial parents.

Calf-raffle. Baby's Breath.
Referenda gone berserk.

We loved you Julep.

Herd-weak & lost
to density cursing mass -- you've left
our space
a blind hole
that's all of you &

sucks at us.
The automated petroglyph
still hides
'below the Zen Master's robes,
weaving & bobbing
like a small rubber palm.

The automated petroglyph renews,
shedding listless caterpillars
onto our tents. Tomorrow
something yellow
must die.

The automated petroglyph returns
to the Chapel of Painful Submission,
its vestigial muscles
thinking hemlocks
throughout the suburbs.

The automated petroglyph
kissed
for its pure
oscillation,
sticks like grass
to the top of our heads.
Enormously at variance
with the mule's earache
& feeling precocious

she drew a picture
of testes flattened
between bricks. Knowing

full well the
aborigines
can't read, we flattered her

with studied leers
& led her toward
the "pit".

All twelve of us hummed
the familiar melody
of "Lost in the Vagina"

as she gestured cosmic-
ally, clawed
the air & fell.
Mrs. Drew tends
to be a little strange
anyway. She talked
all night
of something she called
metaphysical couvade
& the bulldog
cylinder.
Not one of us
understood
though she demonstrated
with a trowel.
Henry, maybe thinking
of what she said in
the tent, & hoping we'd look
to him for the giggle
slipped into
the creek &
shrieking lyrical abstractions
tore his trousers.
She reeled
fighting
for thigh-bound spirituality,
his genteel gore.
They made it in a tent
on a parking lot.
"We are animals in rut"
said Christine -the -slimmer.

Do unto your bumpers & grids,
do the macadam.

Lifting the coverlet
he allowed that chilly breezes
might wrinkle the scrotum.
Prepuce expansion.
Oh cock.

Oh Avis it Hertz!

1) Inventing the canvas fold-out
& rental sex-pack.
2) Preventing life on the highways.

"You bell my clapper" he sang.

3) A quaint church
nestling
in paved foothills.
4) Denying orgasm for reasons
too painful.
5) Applying physics to flesh.

We'll park our bodies
& find true sex
beyond the sweat & thrash
of the particle universe

we'll feather the waves
& make babies
in reverse.
A green plastic stamen
is the key!
Twist the appleskins taut, tie
the epidermal foil
to your foreknobs.

Once critical speed is reached-
your mother's menses
a kind of slippery ballad,
a Law degree or
something Alyce takes off on stage.

Let traditional metrics
rage. Pollen-dipped drumsticks
poached for brunch.
Look for a fence-post to rob.
Don't balk at the red owl,
it eats mushrooms too.
Deep behind its face
the inscrutable swims
for its life. Because it is

it means. Because it is no longer
the opaque window sings.
Don't balk at change.

A sermon encased in glass
whirrs out of steam &
we gather to hum its praises.
Precious droplets of common moisture
form a liberating chain.

A feathered forehead, a damp cowl.
My ass is a temple she croaks.
So does a frog, & there's more
to an empty wine bottle.
She likes to shout down freights.

She calls her coupling
the boogie fuck. Put a cork in her mouth
& she'll let go a few flats. Poems
like this are circle-jerks, they

jerk & circle, jerk & circle.

Her confessor swoons. My ass
is a miracle! A miracle
my ass, three Hail Marys & an Our Father for you.

She steals his sacred juices
& breaks wafer for good.
Bespectacled & prim,
Where in the backhoe legend
will we market this simple

disaster? A summer wasted on weed
is more than a professor.
A trick-baby striped like morality
on an orgy of rosewater. I said backhoe.
Cat. Rotorooter bliss

comes to college. Lets get
your 2nd grade nun into this.

Cross-masturbation. The universe
like a beehive. We'll spin the grim reaper
to a tight weave, chaste.
The peace-creeps are balling
the grunts. Here's
the old-fashioned blessing
for our lunch. The universe is chaos
& we're blind
to the hole in the shadow

of the cross
winds. So like
easing back to consciousness

this simple glider. From this high
the clumps of tiger-lilies a good case of acne
rampant through the fields. Don't
lullaby me you skinny stiff, I want meat!

No tantrum of genius will forsake
brute fuck.
Good & Evil, you think
of your married friends
who really dislike each other,
aren I t good for the children
seem wrong you say think of
the universe as a kind of beehive
but no, they have this vow

& John Ashbery
an expressionist landscape
the form everything seems to lean toward
the longer you look

She says "fuck you!"
He says "I'd like to"
& arches humming into his

The dangerous tomato
The immaculate
You take my fingers
& my elbow, my
scrubbed foreknob
into the Chapel of Tangerine.

You take me. My schoolbooks
askew in the damp grass
like so many stream pebbles.
You loosen the burnoose, a ripple
down my flank.

We drink. We receive
the citrus blessing a fruity
punch. Doubling over
in the position known to induce

I club you to death.
The tree surgeons did
what they do
made love with their chain saws
till you could stand no more
& left me here alone
yammering like a calf

I glisten with their immaculate killing

They've gone
& the leaves I sleep on
decorate my buttocks
with their veins

My penis rose like a tree
I cut it

please forgive me
So delicate a word
we fear the child.

You cling to your past
where your mother waves the blue kerchief

your earlobes flail, no no no
inert
beneath belief.

O love
our basement sinks

no colloquy can save us

you touch my cornea with your tongue
& we read it.
Adrift in a vision of mountain tunnels
trucking in the Rockies.
Loads of logs.

Your grandmother knew molasses
& your shoe,
the old one you used for packing-in your sorrows.
But the way they lifted off
slowly, with a vibrating hum
high into the thin, cold air

you felt cheap. You wept.

Drifting now a bloody knothole
in a suicide plan,
your fingers un-
clasp, releasing the only love she grew.
From his hospital bed he says
I miss the boar-grunt blessings,
dung on the wind. My chest
is tits & still they give me
needles. I remember

the old country. I know
dirty pictures in the attic
whack-off the teenager. What else
could I do? Too much

real butter. Suppositories
are no treat. The nurse picks off
the sheet & says she'll pray
for my body. Who needs that?
All anguish is theoretical,
wild saliva.
Who spit blood in the jujubes?

Brandy starts the new stance
below the addiction
threshold. We lay together
to break a moan.

This is about requited love &
the feasible orgasm
which happens
here.

Don't say this Is
the beginning
of a writing career. Don't say
career. These lines
are not "another matter"

& we don't mean to rhyme.
So take your terror straight
& pick out the cotton
left by
the headphones.
juice it.

It's the Muse staring through
like a laser sizzling a retina
brings us to an off-rhyme in home.
Brings us to drool
for crucifixion.

A sexual allusion to Krapp's last spool.
An erection of comfort.

The desire to end this
with something beautiful
is a kind of rape.
This is garden smack,
this is America.
this isn't Molasses University.
We're not in Kansas.

This is where it takes a knife in the back
to get dignity
between the lungs.

It's all a matter of re-entry speed
& pressed pink wafers
of fusil oil & blood.

Even the Great Leaders wake from their Dreams
with r.e.m. hardons.

They're after us pal.

They're not frogs
going gribbitz gribbitz in the mud --
they're swinging spades
toward our gardens, hankering

for cock & balls
the body's wrinkled tubers.
People do the weirds for more
money & fame than
church control

Rate your loved one

Ow that smirks

with internal medicine
how painful the failure of that concer

Dildo slick as a skeeter's tongue

Wheels across space touching
lightly, lifting from
the nerve knot below the neck's base
your stone

Never trust a jesus freak's placebo
Half the brains it took to survive
the Om tomb

Rate your lobe

Sucking the artificial limb

In control
utterly
& weeping by turns

We acknowledge its pain but must
continue meeting microbes
openly

A fistful of nightsoil reconstitutes the academy

Subtle
as litmus revolt
Bending slightly she
overcame
the spheroid desperation
of a certain memory

Post-coital political struggle

& after the rise of
clitoral criticism
we pass the bladder signal

Death as pleasure field

Toward resurrection of slaughtered intelligence
as machismo prayerwheel

We're gamey, tough
at center,
declare communal pulse-rape
a natural holiday
We took him in & waited
for them to show
but he didn't last so we left

Presidential tumescence

Today in France
a cluster of seven unemployed bishops
consecrated the eleven-
inch erection
of a thalidomide adolescent

Evincing the anal control of a Quaker mutant

Disguised as waning faith in natural foods

We applaud the lesser fortune
spent bugging
the perfect masters of psychic adultery &
assassination techniques

Catharsis outlaws
doing time in the Ivy League
The history of foreign policy
as hard-core pornography

Post burial menopause blues

Received four years to life

Bending to pick a blossom she notices
the fear

The rate at which the peripheries
of human consciousness expand
is conversely proportional
to the increase in density of the black tumor

Father, your finger up me, is that grace?
Sleeping through a seminar
on the mock-hormonal flow
of Papal securities
his hard-on

But lieutenant, human lives are priceles

The beauty of nuclear waste
as a kind of immortality for the species

she said. I've suffered
the terminal perversity of acupuncture
& love's ruin -

its mystical ash.

Once past the initial frictions
I can turn a sack
of blood garbage
into a sweet little tune.
It's the proscription of sextuplets
I'm for

Her tongue in
my cleft
palate
a finger playing
the ridge

she kill for pleasure
she not a zoo-baby &

there's a ravine behind
my dead grandfather's mortar-
chinked log barn
where I lost the double-barrelled
gun that shot corks

& dirt into her eyes
she cried
I couldn't let her go she'd tell
her mother

threw it in the crick
I didn't lose
my way back over the baby toads
ankle-deep
that year

I lied they didn't
like my nose
mouth I talk funny &
hate
your tongue you slut
Last week I talked
on poetry
for the artificial limbs people.
I floored questions.
They came around
flexing their fixtures, the sunlight
off polished metal
pulling the walls in.

I said a small poem you command,
the large has you in
for tea & locks the door.
What I said waned in importance
as I gained charm.
A musk grew I was
a buck goat fluttering my tongue
for a kiss.

There was Jeanette
whose fingers
& forearms were nude.
In her eyes was an intelligence
surrounding the room.
They worshipped her
& my presence was what they did to congregate.

I came to talk & they said write
for us a poem about her.
We've let you see.
Okra and bean sprites played riot
with domestic spaces

while terrorists rubbed plutonium
into the dry folds of recession. Votes

were cast, and before the mantle of persuasion
fell on its feces
a wizened Sufi surrounded the pile.

Earthworms went on strike
for safer loam.

Syllables followed like ill ducklings
a feather down stream.
A chemical detergent
spray was
dropped on millions
of blackbirds in
a 29-acre roost
last night

Snow flurries were mixed
with light rain
and temperatures in the
upper 20's as a cold
front moved through
the area -- perfect

Conditions to allow
the detergent to wash
protective oils from feathers and
temperatures cold enough
to let the birds die
of exposure
A fine morning
to you.
Things are
shaping up for me
over here. I am thinking
of getting back into
Ham Radio. My job
is pretty good. Weather
here has been quite
changeable. Those pictures
are nice. You can get prints
you know. I'm thinking of
having one on my desk --
to remind me of our
"funny sides." I think you
should know I'm doing
better with my problem now.
In the study, near the bed, near
the blackened bootstring's
constellation of knots,
the old cat lies pulling at
her stitches. Already the fresh

bleeding has mixed with the orange
of antiseptic. Already the wound
has become hers. Now her sharp tongue

probes for the tumor, that comforting lump
she knew as a kitten. But no, her last
chance to nurse and clean
has been taken, and now her slow
body shivers, her head goes down.
Her face
a crutch
on ice

her thoughts
deranged as
a shattered hip

she comes forward
to touch
the infant's
genitals

with the cool
metal
of her spoon
Take the deaf
mute whose
eyes are twin stars
of pain.
Brilliant.

Take the country-
western singer.

Take the boy who wasn't
asleep
when mother
conceived his enemy.
Brilliant.

Take the billiant news
of cancer,
of car-wreck at
36 below. Take the love's chain-
saw in the limbs.
Home.
God's brilliance.
Six

the push-
pull of
her breathing

I love you she
once said but
this makes
my heart

You hurt her
with your hard
body and then

you stopped her cold.

The rains took
her face
down the creek

old badger

Love loss:

your future
coming on

a pick-up truck
driven into
the ditch
to kill a dog
He teaches the boys
and girls to play
volleyball and soccer.
He has the large
engine in his car,
which is fast,
loud, and silver.
Today the red-
head Hollywood star
is coming to the shopping mall,
coming with her
slippery oscar.
He wants to slide his
butcher knife
between her ribs.
His tiny penis
was eaten by
a rat in his crib.
The one tear she
shed for me
still limps home
with its burden of neon light

and I am bored in life
awaiting the sudden
Gonna learn to drive
the big rigs, gonna learn
to fly.

I been hanging here
since I was a kid, not
getting someplace, just getting pushed
around. I never much liked
this town, never liked the people.
I'm tired of trouble, tired
of being scared to kick ass.

Gonna get me a rig and make some cash.
Gonna set the record straight.
You there

        Middle-aged man
        in green work shirt
        pants
        work shoes
        with a dented gray lunch box
        under your arm
        stepping off
        that bus

              you catch my eye
for a moment
                     don't
look away
                   in you rests
                   a commitment
                   of mine

here
           let me carry your lunch box

you needn't know me and
you don't
                  but listen
                  I know you have a daughter
                  who takes lessons
                  on the violin         you work
                  evenings
                  tending bar to pay for them
                  don't you

sure
and your wife has four brothers
all of them bigger
than you
play poker        throw horseshoes

right

           but you don't
           really like them
           do you
                      that's okay
                      really

I know how it is
I know a lot
about you
                you're a nice guy

mind your business
just want to be left
alone
I'm going to kill you
She repeated for us
all she knew of
the amputee issue.
The bliss is untenable
she said, and spoke of a swarm
that complicates the tongue.
Avoid stray marks and corner rust.
Revive the hunger for cost.

We learned then our one decision
is made by grief-light,
and as we toasted the new
gangrene paste procedure,
her face became
the exquisite wound.
She is subject to toad
faints
the Doctor claimed.
His research in oral malfunction
led quickly to the mauve
fricative and

the buttery gleam
of tragedy.

The ward went ragged
to the moan of
let me be your bomb shelter baby...

Not too late for shock-tuning
and hormone
reversal. Too soon
for solar power. Profits
will suffer, wailed the Chief. Give me

health care that sharpens
the human, give me
an elegant cry
of despair -- nothing better!
Somebody consumed
the jelly-bean jewelry.
The black went first,
then those with tender green sprouts.
We must feed the world's wealthy, yes,
but is it Art? Will China realize
a handsome return? And how does Christianity
figure in this? Some fiend,
starving no doubt, ate our beans
without preference for color
or creed. But the black
went first,
we know that.
Even his armpits
are going bald.

In the corner of his mouth
the white fleck
of speaker's spittle
has been applied with make-up.

His face in the elevator
is a drainage ditch

and his asshole squeaks.
Who laughed
longest
when the bright
young
Senator from
Nevada
pitched
the Siamese
kitten
and string of lit
cherry-bombs
into the broom
closet?
No idea but
her penis

perfume

eyelashes butterflies settling
to eucalyptus

whispering

his breath
catches

and slips
You claim the poem
about water
that came when you pulled
flesh back at the sink

When you pulled your trousers on
you chose not
to identify the weeping

We'll be good friends
you answered
turning your back
turning a little red in the face

One's work makes demands

No need to defend
a commitment
to grace

No shame your
infernal genius for pain
If someone close
to your mother
said "I feel amphibious"
and your father came out
of retirement to
break that person's cartilage

If your younger sister
displayed suddenly
and no one in the family could speak

Would bottom-fish attack a skunk?

Could you walk out of your limbs
and survive?
It happens I'm dying
of this language.
I have become the lost
climber in the chilly
post-literal alps.

So high in the body the blood thins.

To survive I must be as intimate
as oxygen.
Starting with an emotion
inexpressible
as fear suffered
by a domestic animal, or hope
that the twentieth century will end.

A hotel falls into the ocean.

How can we tell what we feel?
Let us praise desperate repetition

the crone's worry beads
in an earthquake

the strings of dried mouths
about the necks
of the elegant Exxon wives
Let us praise bankrupt technology

the fingers of corruption
opening the dikes
of nuclear disease
Let us praise the church of born-again profit

Let us praise the politicians and polluters
for they are instruments of God

Let us praise televised armageddon
for we will suck poison
and destroy our young
Adrift in a haze of information,
the goat-footed turtle waits.
Nearby, dolphins invent topologies,
gorillas make signs and mute spiders
exchange epics of chemical speech.
Everywhere the organelles are chanting.

The managers and mystics are copulating.
The college of cardinals has targeted cancer
and the terrorists have employed T.M.
The curators bear arms and the sun
drums cadence to Jupiter's snake dance.

Now rising, heavily, like the crystal-centered
boulder gravity failed, like the balloon
of no karma with a small-eyed grin,
the red-faced genius mongoloid has come.
The way is simple, simple, we are saved.
I am the goat-footed turtle.
My house is four and my feet
are three -- the cloven.
I swim with the porpoise,
walk with the snake and deer
and I climb. I am the genius mongoloid.
I have come to lead you
to the new world.
I am Harry Truman
& have hurt you more than
you can know

it was my accent
my harmless collection
of Avon bottles
they are cancer climbing stairs
in your bones

I have founded research
there will be no need to keep dying
on television
& in the churches
no need to eat chemicals

all my breaths have been flattened
like Picasso portraits

please, I beg you, move amongst them
through my library
on the track we have provided for your health

You will forgive me & come to no harm.
Not far behind his yurt
where we moved
in a crouch
through the complicated greenery

where a slight breeze caused
sunlight to jabber at us
like a strobe

we heard the last rustlings
of bathroom noise &
noticed signs of feminine itching.

We discussed the area as a proper site
for yoga, then sealed
with bean-curd
our ear holes.

We carried with us four dark rooms.
Time to think of rodents
in Mesopotamia, & the yellow
Studebaker the girls broke
their bones over. There's a prize-
fighter in the Pastor's future,
alfalfa sprouts rafting
the melted cheese.

We form a committee to host
the second coming of
synchronicity. We ponder swelling
at the joint & the magic
of ear calves. Logic
is the formal accident we
will have no part in.

Citrus vermin & land crabs
have civilized a native
called Mordant. A shill. A stretch
of reason cuter than vinyl
veneer. We've earned our genitals
& class them fiction. We thumb
rides in the Satori wheelchair.
We happened on a burst
of brick music
36 inches from the yellow.
Adrian spoke in layers there
& to this day will
not compute. To some

the brick symphony, to others
lemon concertina
makes sense & goes
the distance. How convince
the family this talk
is not symptomatic? We care

for sincerity. We carefully
dismount the space craft.
Bereft. Be wary of
baloney boats & the Spring toad-count.
Be worthy of your name.
You are full, you are

64 sparrows & spilling.
First reclaim
the small
blue mouth
at the base of the spine

Then plant passion
beneath the landscapes
of protein

Now climb the steps
of semen
to the brain
She was the ground
for a no hint pass,
& she liked being that.
It was bugging a boulder
she'd say, or being a turtle
in a quarry.

She strangled an oak once
and though indicted
still got the bonus.
I can't live with this
her husband cried, she's a cloud
killer, & strings her

slavic grunt through my alphabet --
ain't a word in this house
don't leak! We took note
however, & reported him
the closet fog-racer. So she freed
us, took us off his case

with a suction so lethal
semen climbed the spine
& made thought translucent --
breath on a mirror.
Let me put you in touch,
you've been too long
in the head.

Halve a melon, musk
or casaba,
then rest your elbows
in the frothy hollows
while studying
a photo
of your lover in nude,

This is position one
& imagined while bathing.

Now stretching the fingers
in direct sunlight,
you will notice shortly a tingling in the wrists
& a slight pinch at the juncture
of kite-string & ear.

Being more than a metaphor
behind astral travel,
you succeed position six.

What remains is curvature &
a parasexual organ
of etheric viscosity.
Let me put you in tongue.
Remember our long afternoon of amusement
with their tantric computer,
the bent light and the liquids
where we found them? You seemed
alarmed. You spoke again of loss
and of the mucilage you valued as a child.
"The rubber tips made me think
of mother's nipples" you told me. You begged
that I forgive your debt.

It was like a dance we learned
by simply being where the music was.
I'm an architect
& these thin struts
of consciousness
are my portfolio.

You know my work perhaps,
the benzene ring or
that black tunnel twisting
from Christ to last week.

But it's these small things
make my mother proud,
the indoor root system
for liquid waste &

the transparent hair-net.
I'm planning now for
a perpetual -thought
space sculpture: a reversing

biocosmic field I'll call
the Cheops Chakra Cloud.
I figure we might program it
to pray, or prove we exist.
Coming around the bumper
of the lime green Maverick she
lifted her left shoulder and let out
a little whistle. Her feet were bare,
no 'crunch of the gravel.' Lamar sat in the lawn
chair, looking like his name. As she approached,
off the gravel onto the grass, her arms swung over her hips,
fingers doing a little air dance. Lamar coughed, sounding like a
small child, rose, and taking a long breath, slid his hand down the
front of her cut-offs. He grinned, 'hiya, Red.'
Leslie. We knew we had to figure the mathematics of the thing. We knew they'd be around any day looking for their money, and we had to be ready. Leslie was the answer. Six initiates a day was her average, and no repeaters. Sure, we used the honor system, she could be lying, but nobody doubted her abilities. She had left the Kundalini ashram after 16 astounding days -- slicing the tomato in front of the assembled members was what finally did it. They all witnessed what poured out. She had to leave, she said.
Erick came back to the shop one Saturday morning, visibly disturbed. Apparently the clerk at the post office branch had warned him that the Postmaster was planning action against the 'Cosmic Light people,' for the 'porno' we'd been mailing, and that the non-profit privileges would be first to go. I called an emergency
meeting that evening. We decided it must have been the promotional photos of our group massage program at St. Teresa's.
Getting the rifle and scope was a problem. To be safe, we had the rifle purchased at a sporting goods store in Kentucky, and the scope at K-Mart. We paid the buyers each $25 -- 1 don't know who they were. Red told us her friend Lamar could be trusted, that he'd been a sharpshooter, an assassin in the Marines.
Well, it worked. Time magazine is interviewing Leslie and me next week about her photographs. They are planning to call the feature 'The Death Aura.' Already enrollment at the Institute has tripled, and after the Time article comes out, who can tell? There will probably be enough demand to go national. Ground-breaking in
Detroit is scheduled for April. Eric is running for City Council --
if he wins, and he will, our local credibility will be
impeccable. I'm proud of us all. The real
work of Cosmic Light has
just begun.
Sorcerer, mutant, call him
what you will. He spoke of bird
funnels, and of the breathing mountains
before America drowned.
He described Earth's magnetic shells
as loose sheets of being, but the Pentagon
shot him down.

Memory is the backside of appetite
he taught us, we ingest the universe
with our forgetfulness. He said the door
to the world of surfaces swings in and
swings out with breath. It opens with breathing
and closes with our deaths.

Our bodies pay homage to the forms.

He wrote of sex as a ladder only two can climb.
His torturers remembered this
when they found him.
In the chapel to Nikola Tesla, which he built
of steady orbits at the age of twenty-three,
they suspended him on seven lasers
like a nude quail sizzling on a spit.
They jeered "wink out, you fool!"

But he was afraid, and fear is the black chute,
the nanosecond that never ends.
So he converted the pain and rode it out.
Our room
a gesture
              freezes

the walls are cliffsides
the windows
                    ash

a beauty gathers

& we breathe

we breathe to sing this fatal carol


Beauty is the butcher
whose lines

we croon
Gertrude said the egg-carton
made me do it, that obscene,
that formed low-grade paper
caught me holding breakfast!

So we got our gear together
and drew conclusions. We wanted
music as chilling as the moan
of reason going down. That's

when Rudy said life is no
bowl of rose, and anyway,
I'm into forgetting. Forgetting
is three of my moves.
The armature of her dismay survived
the disaster in Halifax.

It requires no polishing.

We've hung a proliferation of archaic verbs
like Christmas bulbs
along her tubes
and over the mesh-like grids. The effect

fragile as the idea of generation.
The spectacle of orange
fungus on a fallen
limb
brings back
her orangutan at Stonehenge,
the dancing, the
disturbing airs
1. Restless as a fir tree in bra
& panties.
2. Hungry as postulates in drums
of drain oil.
3. Wizened freedoms.

Her exam was camping in Idaho.
Her prevalence was an old firearm.
Her curious neck spasm belittled
the marmots into outright attack.

She stripped quickly & slipped into a pond.
The dull foliage was smeared with midges.
The coyote lifted its leg &

delivered her baptismal name.
Undone by a towel on a tray.

No family to rush celery to the cistern
or dangle plums at floating cousins.

No surprise at finding Gertrude
with spiders
was our first advantage, her tiny engine
the last.

At our discovery of adolescence
described
in a burlap diary
Vernon gave in to a seizure.

We all screamed "Mexican virus!"

His sodden towel steamed like pork tripe.
Skin graft, navel, horse-hair bow.

The mules began to bray.
He was puzzled 
and felt like glue
participating in the rich 
daughter's melancholy.

Too late to pry her snails 
from the beam.
Never poke 
yellow 
she said

or resurrect 
one's parents in 
the clutch.

Stroke 
midnight's cat tail 
and remember

ease 

is a blue valise of eggs.
After they had settled comfortably
into the rhubarb cluster
she spoke at length
while he gave the honorary member
its strokes. he wondered what

had the peeled kielbasa
to do with the outhouse glee club?
What of the tongue garbage?

She produced at that moment the last
of the pickled sow's ear.
It was clear their session
had closed. She was done with diagrams
and made a move to cover herself
with several large leaves.
I propose this between
what the Monsignor saw &
the gala lobster luncheon.

She composed at brunch
then signed his contract.

The satin of her tunic was so fine
the elbow wound
spewed a brief chablis -- clear,
& not without effervescence
in the mountain sunlight, the pure air

Her tuba had no place, nor
the simple health of crab grass.

His growth, malignant, was buried
in the corn silk
behind her ear.
Still sitting where Darrell took me
to watch jibberish grow wings

I don't feel like a sanitary landfill,
but I understand

her nerves were a basket of strings,
tangled slightly and swollen
with the milky stone

We bought a dead cloud
and stretched it out over the water bed

it got us all drunk and
now Gertrude's grown
a scrotum

come hook or crywater
I stand accused
Done with elbow wrestling
and still feeling fabulous
in the joints, she climbs over
the vegetable wreckage and proclaims:
I am the poem, I demand to be
the basket of flower eggs!

You're not a poem, he rags,
you're a busy virgin
hanging cartoon wallpaper
on an open marriage, and this
is a bent dream, a rubbery bone
I'll chew till noon!
So what if I stole your photos
of the president in bra and panties,
and fed your kitten carpet tacks,
I know you love me still -- I helped
you get the grant. I twisted

knobs on the TV when your limbs
were sore. I inflated your tire.
I even stroked your body with
the phone while your mother sobbed
and begged you to speak. And remember

the swollen zucchinis and cucumbers
I pulled out of your drawers -- they made me
feel so small. They endangered my career
in film, my mental health. Now you're
after my wealth, you say I owe you

for that operation. You claim the wart
grew back, but you don't have me fooled.
I know what you've been doing
with my hose, and so does your friend
Marlene. We think you are very strange.
She let her hair down
to the immaculate hunger

to its dirty lisp.

My eyes are supernovae and
less gentle than

she said. I'm pretending
a dark astral pussy
and talk funny too. On the edge

of appetite
and more alone

she constructed as two
mouths tunneling
a model of the multiple universe.
She let her hip slip past,
her pale wrists
rotating.

I'm no decoy
she spat,
a brush is a brush today.

And this is no religious
reverie
laced with sex
& science

this is dying fish
& crib death.

Our subscription has lapsed.
Gertrude said life is a decoy.
She said we need immersion
skills, need to know
the dreams of lichen, and the remote tickle
of symbiosis with a brick.

Still them, he shrieked, still your rife
shorebirds
before I'm moved to kill.
Out cruising for a piece
of the blame
they fell on a satchel
of stork tissue
and sold it

to a family of cistern claimants

Next they bought a bolt
of spider cotton
and employed it to entrap
a migrating
Mexican virus

A horde of piss crickets
jumped them
in an outdoor john, but Dolly
survived by pantomiming
her mother's
algae-ridden wooden bowl

Later she met a goat-footed turtle
who fitted her
for choke-mitts and quizzed
her thin syllable's
genitalia

Finally, after a meal of seltzer prunes
and potential tacos,
Dolly and the turtle guided a missle
of spleen tallow
toward the Vatican

demanding pitchblende
for Gertrude's bitter tendons.
A leap of yodel
charisma
means more to the family
than auntie's gram of companionship.

We don't need drugs to remember the day
Gertrude married the bone dowser -- it affected
our plans. Dad lost his business and Mom
took to scrawling "hornet paper" on church envelopes
She licked the flaps and stuck them to everything
including my tub raft, the woozy dutch elm and
the Mayor's fish tank.

Thankfully only Dad did time.

Thankfully several hours have passed.
Never mind the wheel chair, the floatation devices,
it's the buzzing in my marrow
that has my yodel slipping.
She went right and left at once
and we lost her. Never mind the new mattress,
it was a foul weather move, a play on our weakness.
Minutes have passed. The dowser's eyes claim
telling signals have begun to arrive. His rod
curves toward Venus. This is impossible, gripes Boris.
Next we'll be splitting photons. She's gone back
to the fuschia and there's nothing we can do.
The dowser nods and says he hears her giggling.
Skateboard trauma stretches
before the student
like a massive jungle cat

There is fear, & an awe
as foreign as wax in the brain

Figures, these arrangements
let the back-mind speak
properly

where flesh exceeds

where word is instinct & design
Consider the remote pleasures,
how they gather to invent

Remember when you trembled
for the last pear

Ask, if you will, that the sweet potato
explain itself

then prepare for the common thwart
We've been pulling
tongue, unmasking
the automatic potato.

These collisions continue,
& our major pleasure
is alluvial.

So don't say this balance
isn't classical,
don't ride your truss

down teaspoon creek.
A stable of kinetic
nomenclature is not

a petting zoo. No discount
for fools.
We drink the urban
potato
& dance
the pleistocene

Nothing soils us here

where the dampened
ball-peen
hammer

is a terminal theory of pleasure

or a swelling
in the dancer's feet
Today we compare existentialism
to the Ph.D. Think colors,
the dusty squeaks.
Think as long as february
in the Rockies, deer water, glacier.

Or what does pewter share
with a lone ovum? When next
we write home for coupons
all depends on treble phrasing and
six-legged incest. Your mother
collects herself and squeals

"Don't be mouthy now you got
your degree!"
The small, brutal captives
have evolved as
our major
concern.

We thought their formal dress
a convenient
oppression

but now what approaches
like an oily fog
to threaten
this clinical delicacy

may be described only as
Freudness Peculiar --

the classic case of mongrel duty.

We must at all costs
crush this
surly convention.

They will not be rescued
by atrocities
of denim

or the disciplines of lust.
we felt dwarfed
by wrist worship

undone by a towel
on a tray
No family of cistern
claimants

or strings of dawdle plums

no mute spiders
exchanging epics
of chemical speech
It was the engine
advantage

the happiness
that rose by mid-day

like the Mexican virus

our perfect athlete
bound North
for the St. Louis entrail
slalom
This is the story
of child greed
in the province of kohlrabi:

a crisis
of spinach fatigue.

We charged poetry with
diminishing
that young appetite
before a robbery of vegetables
took credence.

We knew seven syllables
could crush
a corn-oil rebellion,
& felt certain our honed lyric
would bridge
the sauerbraten abyss:

the lyric of yak fat
& the mud wolf,
of heavy petting & lungs
stunned by the long
slow moan
of dry leaves.

Poetry celebrates
the republic of meat.
Some people hear the words
vegetable terminus
& think of pacific collision

or skateboard trauma

Some people are puzzled
why their families
survive

why Christmas at home is elitism versu:

As poetry is able, these lines

how do we recognize the karma-looter

Karma-looting is no business

My body is tired for the birds that have flown from me; 
Their fathomless wings are riding from my brow 
In echoes. I have finished naming now: 
They are not lost that fall by an unmapped sea. 

Twilight is home for wrens in the great oak trees 
And for the hawk that in grey caves has lain, 
The peacock, host of the rainbow after rain, 
And river swan, pearl of earth's necklaces. 

Nests are arrayed and shingled in the air 
Beneath the wandering aegis of a word 
Chosen by me. When mating calls are heard 
My poem moves in the desiring pair. 

Envied by huntsmen I numbered the animals 
Gathered from nature in my baptistery; 
The unicorn pranced, eyes arched in mystery, 
And zebras passed musing on parallels. 

I have uplifted tents within my mind 
For timeless griflins with vague wings outspread 
And serpents of the field. Even the dead 
Are sung and not to quietness resigned. 

They have all gone like music from my keeping 
Towards the named world. Left in this silent garden, 
Tired of my duties as its lonely warden, 
I seek forgetfulness at last in sleeping.
I will bring the lion under my roof, 
the fieldmouse and the timidest of hares, 
cobras, the griffin -- it exists now -- the onager, 
and wander, dying, through 
that terrible zoo. 

Then having shed through death my animals, 
as the new Adam I'll awake, 
survive that death and awake, 
the garden as a simple flower before me. 

In its wet depth I hope to see my face.
I am alone with my fish in the fishbowl, 
Getting used to fins, unused to fingers. 
Through naked stretches of the bowl we swim 
Beyond the schools. The noises of school life 
Come clinking across the water-colored pale -- 
I, towards my great fact turning, ignore. 

Oh, grey and immense, his scales hang like a wall 
Of shutters breathing to the water's lung. 
A ray of sunlight flips them into glory. 
I swim freestyle, unnoticeably small, 
And butt very gently on that flank. 

Have I stopped for long? Many hours are lonely. 
The wrinkles on my fingers near the bone. 
Yet when the light from him pours through my eyes 
A rainbow spans my dark interior 
And I linger. Some days we browse in quietness, some 
Sub specie aeternitatis paddle on.
So unhappily magnified to me, 
This man, who sees me as small 
As I see him large, 
Both looking through the same telescope 
At different ends. 
Others disparage him to me; some tear him down. 
A few, perhaps, praise me to him. 
But when at rare times we meet 
Inescapably on the lonely sidewalk 
And cannot talk, 
We edge around each other like gamebirds 
Of different species. 
And because that is so, 
The instrument will not come down for life, 
But hold to the same sharp-focussed ratio 
Our blindness towards each other.
"Honestly, sir, what good are myths?" 

(What good am I, 
that is, whose myth is "sir." 
One has to try: ) 

"Myths are the stuff that lives are made on..."

(No! Twenty faces guard their lives. 
A girl who sleeps with swans....What can you do
but lay eggs? 
Or make it real!) 

"Everybody likes to feel down? 
Feel dawn?" 

(Unsaid: "Oh perverse sir!") 

"The Trojan War, a very important war..."

(But since the Bomb there are no wars no more, 
only athletic contests.... 

I'VE GOT IT, my mustardseed of faith: 
I'll flap my hands and fly! 

God! What a feat! Better than airplanes! 
Floating here with my teaching finger out 
like Gabriel!) 

"This is the way it is! You're living a miracle! 
Let's start a new world here!" 

(But no again. They'd shoot me down, my hunters. 
It says to in the handbook.) 

"Mr. Jones, that was a very searching question. 
Honesty is the best paucity."
He offered himself as game for women's hands 
If they could lay to bulls that kind of straying 
Idly beyond the reasonable fence and the square bull pasture 
Towards the river side. He stopped their playing, 
Made them fall back astonished by the sand 
As, unforeseen, his gentleness alarmed. 
Then, in fear of heightening their fear, 
He paused and wonder danced alone in the air between. 
His lung was quickened presently by a girl 
Bolder than all the rest, sidling with laughter towards him. 
But for the river she was all that moved, 
A plait of flowers in her hand, desire in her limbs 
For motion in the pattern of a dance 
And the heaviness of strange intent about her. 
Is there a heart not gathered by faint swaying, 
This way, this way, accompanied by laughter? 
Far within the circles of his body awakening 
And moving at first outwards came the bull. 
He tapped once, bowed his head and tapped again 
As if to shake off springs of violence, 
Then sank, for his great body was allayed 
Partly and without malice he gazed there. 
Soon the cowering girls made a ring about him; 
Europa set her wreath upon his horns. 
A silence fell that gave voice to the river 
And the chapped rush of leaves. Then with a sigh, 
As the Europa in each girl was loosed
To a corporeal rhythm, dance began. 
Figures insinuated by desire 
Flashed forth, evoking mushroom agonies 
Or little wildernesses of turmoil 
In the surprised beholder. Yet the dance 
Trimmed their incipient fire to pattern still. 
And the quiet music was answered by the bull 
Only with breathing and abstracted eyes. 
They were displeased by so much darkness garnered 
Slothfully there and longed to see it rise. 
Some struck him as they passed with whips of scarves 
And some threw flowers. At last Europa dropped 
Upon his back and stroked the glacial hide, 
With her moist hands exploring pallid folds. 
He could not bear the weight of that last garland 
And all the impositions on his mood 
By careless girls. He roused himself, therefore, 
Out of the invisible chains of simple being 
And joined them, moving faster as they moved 
Until his foot was light with that sweet dancing. 
But they are often slain who play with darkness 
Or left behind near the original ground 
Raising bruised fingers toward a blind ascension. 
The bull, aflame, sprang for the water. Cries 
Rebounded as if laughter struck blank walls 
And the disheartened ring of virgins, flower 
By its own beauty spoiled, fell back and broke. 
Then they came together, as we see them here, 
Trailing along the distant water's edge 
Like the shucked petals of a ripened tale.
Clutching a horn, as her part taurine gown 
Already mingles, chosen Europa rides. 
The bull has leaped at once through sky and water 
To harmonize with that which most dissolves; 
He pulses toward fulfillment on a groundswell, 
Followed by what the stewpots of the sea 
Exhale: a fish flecked with the primal sunlight, 
Runnels of foam. Love's bedfellows are here, 
Planing the unforgettable blue in chubby disarray, 
Their arrows bathed in Alpine clarity. 
It is the seed-time of myth, strewing and passing over; 
As in an hourglass when the sand drops free 
The future spreads inexorably. Onward, 
Where shafts of rock hoist the aspiring wave, 
A couch is set; within an open meadow 
A tentative cradle waxes in its tree.
If Venus rose from the sea, then who am I? 
For such a womb to stop at one 
would be to nature's derogation -- 
and so I think we all rise from the sea, 
separate and sisterly, 
combing in the tidiness of fashion 
here on the beach of time, and every 
woman is a wave, a slower wave.
Once there was a boar hunted by all. 
Though some tempered spears and stayed at home 
and others baked bread for those who went along, 
staying at home themselves, 
everybody in his heart was hunting. 

The boar was never taken, 
but ran in his wounds through the woods perpetually 
(I hear him running through those woods today, 
grunting and goring.) 

There are many ways to hunt: the bravest 
get in among the still points of the spears, 
that woods within a woods where the boar is 
at the kill,

(though a kill never happens; 
for what is the great body loping through 
far glades of trees but the boar still? 
There is at best only a resurrection 
with all the bravest asleep round the new boar.) 

The cowards make passes at the boar from afar 
and write the poetry of hunting. 

A few, it is said, turn from blood though pressed 
even by their own blooded hearts' unrest, 
and when the bakers bake, the slughorns blow, 
they neither spin nor sow.
Sparrows were lassoed by ironic eras, 
Bundled with trees and breezes in the barn 
Of sentimental stock. They're always with us, 
Though, as the whole world to the palest stone 
Is with us, moving out its life or death 
Mysteriously beyond the equals sign. 
How did they fly? Were holes a last resort, 
A doubt left in the fabric of our barn? 
For surely sparrows punctuate our lines 
Again and breezes merit praise for blowing. 

One can deny man's captions, not the thing 
That they're attached to; little sparrows arched 
Their bodies with a flair in hostile eras 
And sallied through imaginary walls 
Like scornful ghostlings. Even the bumptious air 
Shatters our meaning with variety. 
Blake had it, You must kiss them as they fly -- 
Or miss them. Lacking minds, perhaps, they live 
Out there, companions in transience, live and thrive; 
One that's denied will batten in your dreams.
The tiger is foliage and the foliage tiger. 
If you strolled into him, you would, of course, 
Find out what continent you were strolling in. 
The tiger is foliage and the foliage tiger. 

But camouflage is the tiger's pocket fortress, 
More to ward off while he sleeps in the sun 
Than to engage. At night his eyes burn forth; 
But camouflage is the tiger's pocket fortress. 

He thrives more by alchemy than vigor, 
Pawing dead leaves to powder when they lie 
Between him and his prey. Old tigers lose 
Their vigor to the alchemy of pawing. 

His final spring dispersed along lianas, 
His body to the leaves, his growl to air, 
The hunter finds dead tiger everywhere, 
Dispersed along the longest of lianas.
The day I was eaten 
began warmly under mother as usual. 
They called me a fool 
to go from there to breakfast 
unafraid. 
My way's my way. 

It was a decent calfhood, 
the sleeping and eating part. 
Before I had a chance at sex with gnus 
a tiger deflowered me 
by the throat. 

Well, that's life 
and this is afterlife 
in the head of a man 
who's playing with my name. 
He has to look me up 
in a book, of course, 
to see if tigers really do it 
to gnus. 

I can't complain: 
a little pleasure, a little fear, 
one big event, 
and then to have done with it. 
In my will is my peace.
Now stretch pale fibers of the day again 
And the vast weaving that the sun betrays 
Is lying open to the winter rain. 
All color is an echoing of greys 
Half danced to by the jagged evergreens. 
The field's impassioned flowers have fought the sting 
Of the cold long ago. A mandrake leans 
In a locked swamp, the ice's overhang. 
Shadows toward night grow till they loop the world. 
The curved blade of their East cuts one by one 
Dark patterns on the landscape. Soon the cold 
Of light will tunnel through the air alone 
And men will know how little can satisfy, 
Watching a lonely star possess the sky.
I am the animal inside my body, 
the healthy and knowing squirrel 
in a forest of malignancy. 
When will the trees lower their mosses? 
I want a clearing far from their ill sap! 
Oh, if they hurt me 
I can get smaller, 
smaller than the fingers of their evil. 
My name is Enid.
Herohood's out of reach 
for the old indispensable octopus crying 
"Bring me my telephones!" 
But on the sly we love his virtues. 

He's always at work among his neighborhoods 
at the bottom of the sea, 
which through his alien way become less strange. 

He's always at work 
and we, whose day must take 
its underwater leap towards evening, 
watch his joy. 

It's like the joy of those we envy, 
the lovers and pilgrims 
and the train buffs 
holding hands on the good excursion: 
"Here we are in what we know so well!" 

In the vacation of his character 
he has all this without a journey. 

Who is he?
The skin of this peach is drawn 
back in zigzags; in that 
a baby Charybdis 
of rot twists down 
towards the peachstone 
lazily. At 3', 
5", the table bears 
five oranges, one splitting 
(like the peach), two pears and room 
for more food. 
                      Across the room 
a girl, sexy, legs crossed, 
intense as an animal, 
has her skirt played with by 
sunrays. On her finger 
is a small diamond that recalls your mind.
The used water pulls around his ankles 
and backs off toward the hole 
for what's not wanted in his world. 
And he has come this far, dripping and clean, 
an otter without wound. 

Now the cold white sheets and the white night 
printed for the last time with the Text, 
its frayed edges glowing into color. 

He chants his eighteen lines in a still tongue 
and with the hypnotizing of his fear 
sleep comes.
A girl who had fallen among Christians 
tired of good Peter, good William, good Paul, 
the Old Faithful of the Sunday social, 
and sat above her long legs travelling 
to Babylon. 

But it was a little Babylon, 
slow and remote, 
and she had ripened too long on the wrong tree, 
a fruit too dark now for the calm arrangement 
of a pagan garden. 

And so this ibis of a girl, this gift given 
over and over to itself, returned 
to the small town, 
where each night when the stars shine, 
from her childless room an answer 
phosphoresces.
No one to referee that game, 
Poor fledglings, with their heads thrown back 
And mastered hips joined to their shame, 
Are lonely partners on the rack. 

Who is that watchman of the night, 
Stretched out, staring so vacantly 
From his filled bed until the light 
Of day permit activity? 

And who lies breathing at his side, 
In sleep a kind of ruffed grouse? 
Is it the girl that neatly glides 
About the duties of her house? 

They married decent strangers; she 
For images of his despair 
Without her, for his good name; he 
For guilt and the curling of her hair. 

Yearly to interpose delight 
They go upon their honeymoon 
Again, where things are never quite 
The same although they should be soon. 

And a small cottage has sprung up 
Near a favorite swimming cove; 
Every summer they come up 
To localize their straying love. 

On starry nights after their meal 
Old rituals of hand in hand 
Begin and what they think they feel 
Makes them lie upon cool sand. 

So they tumble by that shore 
Of the uncaring upland lake 
As if it were not done before 
And each moans for the other's sake.
A fingertip, an earlobe, any hair 
Led to the open country of love, my dear; 
And we knew all the ports and all the countries. 
But did we know our bodies' 
Silent, peripheral, and other life 
That pushes warts to light, withdraws them after 
Like rock-faces in a primal sea? 
It was that life, perhaps, gave you to me 
Or me to you... 
                                           No matter: 
Part of ourselves swam the same turbid water 
And walked for a while the selfsame tropic land. 
But as one forgets in time which arm was sprained, 
Which finger cut, or which hand had the wart, 
So we forgot the travelling lover's art 
And stayed home in ourselves although together.
Reading the scholarly notes on vanished places, 
Hebron and Babel, the mirror to lilacs, 
And Athens, its stone piled upon old stone, 
There danced antique young men about my mind 
And girls whose hands caught by a sculptor's hand 
Turned into flowers waved for a thousand years 
That stranger girls could match them with their own. 

And when the scholars wrote of soldier mummies 
Like walnuts in their undecaying biers 
With all their flails and arrows rusting near, 
The imagination of my sex was stirred 
By wasted concubines longing for princes, 
Who decked themselves in veils and chaplets for 
The delectation of a rival's eye. 

Seeking the regent of the voiceless wood 
At Versailles in the fall was reading too -- 
Another style of wandering down paths 
Not scythed by my own hand. The king was hidden 
Beyond the renewing green of his domain; 
He caroused elsewhere with the Greek girls and boys, 
The warriors and forgotten concubines. 

Yet all danced in that absence, even stone: 
Unlike the absence which avoids my text, 
Hardly ferried across dividing waters 
By note or snapshot. Now I must be one 
Who goes at guilt-time home to a bare hearth 
And a processional of empty rooms 
Unfolded to the dying of my smile.
The youngest son is riding on the plain; 
Mother is A the last cow at the stalls: 
"A week at most and seven dragons slain 
To fill the niches of ancestral halls," 
He murmurs, counting merrily as he rides, 
"And if some dragons fail to block my way, 
Why then lost virgins will or lonely brides: 
God, who makes youngest sons, will make the fray', 

Somehow, a land away, the roads are longer 
And noble girls are chary of their sins. 
Upon a brown mule, beggar-eyed with hunger, 
Past rain-pocked statues of St. George, past inns 
Whose rational keepers brook no free abiding, 
The eldest son is riding, riding, riding.
Some men gradually begin seeing diamonds 
as the world champions in staying power, 
men of talent, men of sweetness, 
who start off very well in the living kingdom. 
What they don't have is 
mind enough for choosing 
between good and good. 
And so their choices 
erode their characters. 
Before they grow too weak in the flowering, 
dying human world, they make 
one last hard choice 
to put their faith in diamonds. 
Then all the decisions are made forever 
by Talmudic Jews in Amsterdam 
with telescoping monocles 
and chisels like the Lord's on Sinai.
FIRST OFFICER

"He appears in strange territories boldly 
And eyes the bulging tribute pouches coldly, 
Our young snake of an imperator, Max. 
First, the recusant pagans to the ax 
('We're all Romans here. We know what's what!'), 
Then a Forum, a Colosseum and all that. 
But all that civilization's after us: 
We're at the brunt of things with Max the Glorious!" 

SECOND OFFICER

"Freedom lies over the edge of expectation. 
Caesar is free. Such dark paths he can choose from! 
With their brains dimly glowing to prevent falls, 
Most people daily waddle where the flesh calls. 
Caesar, like inexorable bone, 
The grim geometry of the skeleton, 
Underlies things. His will cuts scruple like a razor. 
Others obey the law of not being Caesar." 

THIRD OFFICER

"He alone is pointed to by the past. 
Old men who remember oldtime Caesars nest 
Trembling among friends or thumb the archives 
While stranger bees invade the golden hives. 
And after, when the farms darken, who dares 
Suggest the grain be sifted from the tares? 
Old wisdom is not wanted; one is wise 
To make a sheath of words for Caesar's policies." 

SECOND OFFICER

"Like an idea Caesar is everywhere 
And men, as rational animals, think it; here 
On the northern border and in the desert town 
Or bedded with their virgin wives at Rome. 
He's master of each village, seen, unseen, 
And trees for thousands of miles over the horizon. 
No matter what he does, all buildings remain 
Sunning within his empire, from India to Spain." 

FIRST OFFICER

"Contradictions, if bold, prove him to us 
Like victories. We move to the subtle choice 
Of countermarch as to attack. And rout 
Itself is but the heavens reaching out 
To touch him like an oak in a thunderstorm. 
Of course, too many defeats and the hoods come 
With their unanswerable knives and thongs, 
But Max rations defeat as garnish for our songs." 

THIRD OFFICER

"He will be stabbed someday by a retainer, 
One of the scarred kind, an old soldier 
And family man, upon whose arm he rested 
His own in foul times, one whose love he wasted, 
Being careless to inflict the private grief 
Which cuts through love an opening for the knife."
Only from our point of view, as masters of the table, 
does the eater of crumbs glow with a terrible 
                loveliness. 
He clings to our pity like a bat, 
certainly. And a few, independent of the prince, 
think that disgusting, our table his rafter. 
They miss the light in his face when we bowl him 
                the crumb. 
For a moment he sees it with the fullest glance, a baby's 
his crumb without compare. 
There is nothing else in the world but its hollows, 
                its rims, 
bounding dreamily over the tablecloth like sagebrush. 
From a distance he drinks the shadows in, facet by facet, 
and swells. 
What a pleasure to hear us, the masters, counting -- two, ah, 
three 
until, lovingly, it's his!
A secret I know about China, 
huge and twitching land of rumor 
and cloud mountain, goes: 
After a thousand years of news 
from the press invented there 
and speeches for that press, the polls 
as slow and sure as quicksand 
drank all history down 
and left only story, like the villain's hat, 
afloat on the foam.
Work at making less to touch 
of yourself and of things. 
More against nakedness than anyone, 
live in skins up to the nostril 
held open still for breathing. 

Very little happens on horizons you watch, 
though sometimes in a corner the newborn 
scapegoat gets to suck or suck twice. 
When you hear of it, 
sense the old stakeout in your body -- 
everything new wants to nest in you -- 
and pave everywhere to keep the life down.
So many wreaths and trees are hostages 
For the withdrawing spirit. Even the jails 
Are covered with them and the station houses 
Twinkle in boughs and bulbs a festive welcome. 
Where are the children merciful enough 
To say they believe in Santa still? I watched 
His vicar shot at by a ten-year-old 
Armed with a toy ballistic missile launcher. 
I laughed, of course -- one cannot choose but laugh 
And ride the loaded escalator down. 

So many old distractions are at hand 
To grace the time. Widows beguile the lunch hour 
By decorating ledges on the airshaft 
And in the park mild, city-loving deer 
Are fed popcorn by priests. 
                                          Silence surrounds 
All the pieties of this gone world 
Laid out in spangles under a cold sky. 
The city bears its unconnected sorrows, 
From furnished rooms where egg nog watchers sleep, 
Old men shepherding their loneliness, 
To houses of the merry gentlefolk 
Before which coeds sing of Bethlehem.
Here is the highway of dead birds, 
the hopeless dodging animals. Skunkbloom, 
that is the last defense, the finest; 
a small broken body is the other, 
though sometimes it's unholy length of dog 
dead sideways two three four, 
the legs in the air the horror. 

And this is the highway of from here to there, 
route such and such intestate, 
clean for the most part, nothing in between 
except the foursquare talking in the car 
and the foursquare watching silence, covered over 
by the car's baked metal skin. 

And so we have two worlds, one out, one in, 
dying to cross each other.
The hospital rises in a foursquare void; 
North, east, west, south, the flowers are down, 
Varieties of afternoon birds flown; 
If bats litter the sky, the sky is a bat, 
The hospital glowing brokenly through its wings. 

Elsewhere is breathing and the darker functions 
Valve and unvalve in darkness and the sea moves 
Sowing its clams under the world's foreskin; 
Shells prey upon shells and empty them -- 
But that is backhanded life and of the void. 

Yes, other stone remains in the watchman's hand 
And though the restaurants have given up, 
Leaving their Maginot Line of chairs to the night, 
The sun will waken on a brickwork shoulder. 
For the eye of dawn things will spread out, 
Tower and flower, whatever is in hiding, 
The watchman lose the familiar room again, 
His table, chair, and lunchpail to the light -- 
He will lose the burden of keeping it all together. 

Now we are wires between abundant charges, 
From sun to sun: the nurse who plots the line 
Declining on the fever chart towards morning, 
While she patrols her corridor of wounds, 
The watchman, and the watcher...If we snap? 

Far away on Blue Hill, above twigs and brambles 
And quiet pressed lairs, 
Rises the cleft observatory, the knife in its heart -- 
All night the exposure festers forth new stars.
These days the sunlight almost seems total. 
A few men, trees, stand between heaven and earth. 
In the light of their shadows we others are 
        reading, still, 
messages the dead have stopped sending, 
these days of almost fatal sunlight.
As suburbs are the rings of hearkening 
To the great city's cry, so is this hood 
That has been thrown about me, although rude, 
Yet the impatient caping of my spring. 
I cannot tell what the ripe year will bring 
When it flees haunted on before these crude 
First sessions of despair, nor what the lewd 
And ghost-tainted brain will learn to sing. 
But if by nightly forays in the world 
Of pictures that a childhood stored away, 
By charting the transparent lands that lie 
Between the cedar trees, one thought is whirled 
Into an action that outlasts its day, 
My shadow wears the stone it passes by.
Before this hour is pried by the hawk's wing 
Rising from its grey nest above the lawns 
And shades of the lifting day, early to fling 
A furrow in the sun and cleave our songs 
Apart from the strong and heartless not our own, 
I would hurl nets of cries into the air 
To wind the hawk in flight that he drop down, 
Himself prey to this questioning, this fear: 
"Before the roofs fly from our shallow hells 
And there is green fire that unties the pen 
With flowering of the flesh in syllables 
To pilfer each thing from its foxes den, 
0 hawk, we must make whole what you have torn -- 
What womb must we sleep in to be reborn?"
The rain, oscilloscoping, heels the roses 
Clinging like suicides to the stalk, but most 
Have fallen petalwise to dissolution. 
Through the stripped maples ads deceive again 
And streetcars roll. The garden is shrinking now 
Into the piecemeal absence cold requires, 
With canvas over the fountains and the birdbath. 
Winter is a drugged suitcase in my attic 
And a leap in time. Soon mantles will be shaken, 
All gardens lie in pantherskins of snow 
And six more weeks be gone. Small things lose force; 
The grass itself flags in the general dying. 
I'd not be stung by honeybees here, posting 
Shock from head to toe again and again. 

It is the tawny season 
When enviable climates warm the mind -- 
Blue skullcaps over the twofold Thebaid. 
In Greece "come, come into the desert" sang 
The sainted birds who catered to the spring 
Of Laius, and in Egypt holy men 
Ignored the foliage of metropolis. 

What were they seeking on the thirsty margin 
Of fire? Was it forty days as one 
For a good look at God? I am sick with time 
And shrink within this bandage of a room 
From where innumerable changing gardens stretch 
To the desert sun. Navel of my desire: 
The windowpane's smug water exiles me 
From the dissolving seasons and the dry.
When darkness had snubbed to sleep even Bruce the Wild,
I oiled my face and hands against night life 
And went outside. In the wet air stars shone 
Like flies wiping their forelegs. It was pleasant 
To patrol slowly through hemlocks rising from sand 
Here and there in the catlike stillness. Chaired, 
Afterwards, in great roots above the ground, 
I read Jane Austen with a flashlight pen. 
But long, feminine mosquitoes coming in 
To my English estate in the Maine woods 
Made me break off. 
                               A whippoorwill slung volleys 
From the back brush as I walked the next patrol. 
I wanted human trespass, though; jailed gardens, 
Fireside cats and dogs, the city...
I foraged beyond my itching summer body 
When the eelgrass near my shoe gave him away. 

The mole was young, but huffed as he climbed over 
His mound; and it was there that I caught him, 
Closing the neutral box of my hands around -- 

Then my hands, turning human, closed around me.
The slightly deformed waitress in black rayon 
And white cuffs wanted me or the Arab page, 
Melmel. Our fantail boss, doling the pay on 
Thursdays, remembered when he was my age 
And worked for less. All's well at the hotel 
Still, I'm sure. The Methodist minister 
Rents room and radio for the double-header 
On Sunday afternoons. As when Eve fell 
The snake slid down the tree, our elevator 
Pimp descends counting from an upper floor. 
I have escaped them; all's well that ends well. 

Yet, sometimes, I catch myself in looking back 
To that sad hive, to the Arab, to the boss squawking 
At Jean, our waitress...
                                   I've seen her in the park 
Where Vs widen as paved walks meant for walking.
Yesterday, after twenty years 
Schools, businesses, and wars, 
I met my wrestling partner Bert 
B. He was the boy who taught 
The nelson, half and full, to the grammar school. 
But Bert was no fool; 
He kept tricks in his bag. I tried, 
And when "Uncle" was cried for, I cried, 
Holding out longer if girls were there. 
He is a bull now. I am a bear; 
Neither wants to talk for long -- 
But, yesterday, in a glance it seemed 
Our little lost bodies sprang 
Toward sweat and the mat again.
That was wings too, 
like everything not rigid, 
everything between two 
people or a people and its city 
or a cloud and its sky. 

The dentist and I 
worked my teeth for half a year, 
the New Boston rising from its pad 
outside our window. 
And as he drilled deeper 
the development reached higher 
and I grew older 
until all was capped with gold: 
his fee, the sky, 
the stumps that lined my jaw, 
that aching row. 

I am complete now 
though the city is still changing. 
I miss the man 
whose intelligence 
lay wholly in his competence, 
all clouded beside. 
Such friendships end 
when the skill that called them up has run 
its course.

Everything human has wings 
(better to name it that than decay) 
and flies toward an inevitable future: 
a city, a body, warmth between two men; 
everything has its day -- except, 
of course, my golden crowns.
From a chamber behind my eyes drops the word "Treasure", 
born of irony out of longing, 
a word without friends in a Spartan world. 
It lies here, outshining the erasable 
bond, the yellow obstetric pencil. 
I have the heart to kill it 
and say, "Aw cmon, word, die! 
Go back, il mio tesoro, if you can't die, 
to the literature that owns you." 

But I know how it is, even on this page, with babies -- 
one wordless day 
I'll find myself becoming grateful.
Out of the strummed nerves of getting by 
I come to where the wall is. 
Squirrels tunnel against it under the ivy. 
I know where the bricks are without winter to show me. 
The sky, too thin for nerves, too simple to be a man, 
spreads over it; 
but everything I call the world stops here. 

Back in my life, when objects failed, I moved them 
like a young chessplayer winning through 
to the bright outside of fame 
by moving his old furniture about. 
Here the wall is, 
old, and new -- immoveable. 

Another world, mysterious wood or holy city, 
stretches its fingertips of tower and twig 
on the far side. 
Men and women who walk through stone have reached it. 
Can I? 

If so, I would have the wall still rising behind me 
like the sober heart of a story that ends well. 
There is enough left in me of the good Jew 
to need a wall somewhere to come back to.
A strange seduction. 
I find myself a young man 
in my father's habit, 
his old browsing eternity 
with the news. 

All of it feeds me -- 
the sports and the comics, 
the front page with its many graves, 
editorials, 
horse-blinders and loss. 

When we were in this life together 
I read like an educated man.
Almost a child again, grown from wading, 
I walk past the end of your life 
where it clearly stops.
The best of what they say means 
"You've got the steel ball 
that we had." 
Hardly a word more that's right, 
as if to describe 
something so round 
and so around 
were impossible. 

I've got the aching steel ball. 
Oh I've got it 
to come on or be come on by 
each day while it grows small. 

Keeping faith, 
I approach the ball as a kind of life 
whose feeling I now hold 
in trust, waiting somehow. 

Where is eternity? I am looking.
In a room I was getting used to 
I found in dust beneath the couch 
a microscopic hunting horn 
I lost as a child. 
(It is my luck to find the things I need 
exiled from where I lost them.) 
Dust, gentle dust, 
coated from my eyes the horn rungs 
and stopped, an ageing hill, the mouth of the horn. 

I reached down, but my fingers would not take it 
as they sloped like pagodas over it. 
My eyes began to blur. 
And now the couch is back, corner on corner. 

Inviolable dust, 
there seemed, as always in your little worlds, 
a chance to set out again through deserts.
It seems the corridors of my childhood 
live behind me and shrink as living people: 
the one at grammar school I stumbled down 
alone during classhour, sick to my stomach, 
it was a kind of endless Karnak 
as I wound my arms around a pillar 
and said, "I will remember this forever," 
noting within my nausea. 

It's there, unfairly small, 
as our assembly hall is there 
with its picture, "The British Burning Buffalo." 
Each of the colors is an orphan 
now that I've grown, seen Turner and Renoir. 

But can all this be so 
in the gradual world of villages? 
Few leave to be surprised at a dog's growth 
on their return, or a field of trees -- 
the sadness of losing out from watching. 
And death diminishes like the road from town.
With many hills around us and tall trees 
nearer to the rain, we always 
feel our nakedness is special. 

Somewhere my name is on a death, 
but whether it sits sunning among fruit 
and fruit decay 
or canters like a nightmare behind me, 
I hardly know. 

And the best that I can do 
is always to feel death as an ambience, 
caring, but not hurrying my feet 
though the warrant-laden sky 
should, like a parent, find me.
because there is always craft 
I have not looked you in the face. 

What am I to do with 
what I cannot understand, 
the ground and the brook and the tears in my eyes? 
Not to have been born 
is the best friend 
of the pure particular places. 

My hand's as good as any toad; 
the different flashes of my clothes 
go with the grass -- 
something to touch is not the bigot. 
What am I to do with 
what I distill, 
an anger in the breathing? 
How can I narrow further to the saying? 

When I'm working I see the grass most clearly, 
the orange alder root at home 
in tough bourgeois 
possession of the soil, 
and, after nights of rain, 
gentle mud laminating the ditches.
The elements I have by heart 
are stone and water. 
Happy the poets with all four! 

I buy and grow 
and sleep with my collection, 
take inventory too: 

And then, for any day, 
a bug climbing a brick is, 
with the right hold of my mind, 
Sinon climbing the walls of Troy 
or the hero, on all fours, over 
the pit in Haggard's She.

I am afraid to see my life this way, 
though every year 
like Actaeon I mislay the fear 
at times out of time 
that strangely devour and leave one. 

The bug goes on with his instinct 
over the brick the seasons wear, 
with hours enough to get a life in.
I am here 
rowing backward from my poems 
and the poems of others. 
Goodbye. How could I stay 
at the dock of their homecoming? 
I row from summer 
with its flickers and cold stoves 
on the long pull. 

Behind me the abyss 
thunders around its parched 
coinspace of an eye. 
Perhaps the coin is stamped 
with a first noun. 

I will row home 
when the shore is strange enough.

Forgetfulness is the pool 
with no buoyancy. 
I have come that far in it. 
There is neither night 
nor twilight, but an obscure

row of days 
like the questions 
that lift 
from a sleepy mouth.

"What happened?" 
"Was it a wild throw 
into the trees?"

Let us have 
aluminum 
and the radio on it, 
the honey light 
and cellophane 
of shallow music.

Through streaked windows: 
a large slow branch, 
the neighbor's 
emerald lawn. A voice 
comes up the stairs 
and turns a homey corner

"Do I love that?"

The mirror across the room 
holds a crescent of hair, 
a nose, and an eye's dark well. 
I do not feel the hand 
that surfaces to confirm,
nor the one that comes 
to stroke the hair, 
to push me down with love.
Too late, the light is like talcum on the hills, 
the morning rush like last night's crowd 
at the stadium, two miles away 
and spilling into the neighborhood. 
Thus I touch the world, saying "too late" 
when I mean "probe," when I fool myself 
into "probe" and mean "mirror." The hills
are just a clock, and the light 
its intimate hands. I am jealous 
of them for being there, for 
making me take this way to them.
It makes me a bus 
from the airport by the sea 
going to a house by the sea. 
For comfort, I condemn 
everyone to be that bus, 
to grasp anything 
that resembles home.
It was a romance with brick: each brick an island, a dome, reefs 
and archipelagos of porous brick, and between them the gray 
mortar, like low-slung clouds within the rise and fall of brick. 
Then, abruptly, like the crack of a frozen lake, the fluid yard 
found its boundaries.
    Every doorway had its crazy niche, locked thighs that crumbled 
in spring's sweaty dew; every window its tableau, with full-
bodied death crushing a maiden's breasts, his tongue driving into
bone.
    At last the trees obscure the street.  The city is crazed with 
renovation.  All night I hear jackhammers, sludge-pumps, the slap
of lumber, trowels rasping.  Stairways cover the old cliffs. One
crisp morning the blue-print rises, dovecote within dovecote,
beautiful graph through which the laughter rattles.
A man rises with his thoughts 
like slant-light 
through hemlock and spruce, a screen 
through which a distant highway 
comes as sea-sound, 
then the tin trumpets 
of seabirds, who are just children 
a few houses down, playing 
so they all touch somehow. The roof
overhead collapses into the next 
through shadow, the white siding of each house 
still more blue-gray than the glaring separateness 
of a few hours from now. But already 
a woman has found
sun on a soft-edged dais 
between him and the children, has removed 
a watch he puts on, has slipped off rings 
he now replaces, and lets go this small gold mound 
where her hand relaxes and curls. He is lost 
and drowsy in the light of oleanders in a glowing vase, 
the conversation between closed eyes 
and bones surrendered to the earth. He receives
this body which floats to him 
on different nights, for the houses look 
as if he'd just placed them: pure titanium on ultramarine. 
He's made her all one color. 
The pale bands 
of jewelry vanish 
into triangles of sand, lapses of sky
that lead where roads are ocean-bound,
where neither of them lives
but where they grope for a place,
their hands one anchor.
*
My bride is distant 
along diagonals of www. Her white dress 
burns out the little sticks 
of a country icon, and the dress 
and a window's lights battle at burning. 
I am unfocused, uncomfortable
in a line of chairs along a wall.
The back of my neck 
rubs splinters of cedar, 
vaguely needing this comfort. Not needed, 
the fireplace roars. I send an occasional song 
and she answers with a word 
that arrives hollow within her voice. 
I leave it before me, turning to see 
who comes down the line: her thin double, 
glowing and aged, and whose hair 
is both blond and gray. Her lips
brush each face on the line, and as she nears, 
her whispering dress mocks that of my bride. I am kissed 
on the mouth. She, mother of the bride, 
leans forward again, drains me, 
each kiss no longer 
but claiming like fire. Her face 
withdraws but does not leave. It's the cabin 
that recedes, the window 
a pale blue space, a young bride its cloud. 
This hand in mine 
is wet in a cold stream, is a third bride 
who comes down a formality of rock and water, 
flowered crown first, her frothy white dress
smoothed by the current. I am snagged
with her, cold as water, 
and the kiss is long.
In winter, the fires in oil drums 
are like the crone's voice 
repeating a child's complaint.

In our search for a likeness 
we have come to these endless stoops 
where men and women are hunched

over the red domes, fallen 
like the stone finials behind them. 
We see her features

scattered among them -- brother, cousin, 
the child...but our hope 
is the white parabola above each fire,

where there is no threshold 
for warmth, just ice 
in the lungs, as when one

turns from the drum for the door. 
Now smoke complicates dusk 
in the east, and evening

is a cafe on the dog-leg 
of a twisted summer; under 
its close roof

is a nakedness that drinks
the after-image of fire.
How stupid to startle the family
from the threshold of sleep, to shatter
one's own face in a window
with night behind it. The moment
has the heaviness of lacquer --
these wraiths in nightgowns and goosebumps,
and then her voice, low and solitary.

Why do shoes fit tightly
on these occasions? One is carried
to exhaustion on concrete, surprised
by the train whistle, the pungent ballast,
a coach brought to one
like a notch in roulette. Into the seat,
into a half-sleep, night left ajar
and the hard black cases
pressing into their thighs. Later, in the suit
of concerts and death,
he would pierce the first formal silence
and the other would follow, hearing
how she came to him with a gesture of grace
so like the dusting of her skirts; how the wet-nurse
became "mama," moulding little mouths
to her breasts. Mama had a way with secrets,
a way to turn them into orange blossoms,
and the wet nurse would press them
into the leaves of her simple dreams,
injuring him in this double affection. Often,
they stare into the bell of the trumpet,
into a vortex of night and trains,
until one or the other
makes his reflection on its rim.
When he's sick, she gets sick, 
but before that, neighbors heard 
his voice, like the hammers 
of a dead piano, beating down breath 
on her, and before that, acacia blossoms 
floated down the aqueduct, with pink toes 
dappling them, and hands with cigarettes 
writing them down, imagining Balzac or Zola 
fishing with their pinkies, as they did 
prior to this, two hard at the game, crayons 
of the past melting in the same bed, 
where the brass turtle on a square of marble 
bore its flute and incense and rattled 
to the edge, useless evermore, though the same 
had happened in the beginning, when in passion 
he struck his heel on the turtle's back, 
bled on carpet and her white calves, then 
licked them clean and made the turtle whole.
Once again I misread. "Be violet," 
I thought he said. Well, he must be sick and drinking, 
the piss-color, amber, bronze, mahogany, 
the strongest things 
kept at the height of his shoulder. 
For he has no doubt been pushed 
into a chair of those colors. By fever, by draining 
three fingers of scotch, by the window 
whose pale wash trembles with children. What is 
one tremble? Half of it? "Here, take my daughter," 
says someone of the woman 
watching the children. Maybe that. 
What is glass 
but what undresses her and is not jealous. 
The intermediary, hearing grapes 
fall to the floor, is obligated to hear rain. 
Maybe that is violet.
Through the plate glass, the blue shadows 
of her pink flesh 
travel over her 
like huge Luna moths, 
or like the dark curls 
at the base of fire, which suddenly, 
but with complete transition, become pale 
smoke.
This is the angel he reaches for 
in the smoke from a broiler, numerous flies 
buzzing through the smoke and around him, 
two doors off their hinges.
                       The meat cooks 
and he must remake the house 
in these odors, in light that clings 
as for a man in the south, whose angel 
is born of creosote and magnolias, and travels swiftly 
to anvil-shaped clouds. Our man,
for whom my map has no home, must finish 
the cookout, must see the afternoon 
through to night, put everyone to bed, then press 
the heels of his palms into his eyes.
Somewhere on the hard finish of this shell,
deep in the tightest curls
toward beginning, is the evening light
like afterthoughts on beginning: traffic as mirage,
complex, disregarded for one fluid line, the closed car.

"Are we going back," she asks.
"Is there darkness back," he asks, for that was the start,
and it is like two arrows repeating, demonstrating.

So the room is dark,
and though they are not
alabaster models, this body
can see that body -- just enough,
like opposite walls in the last curve out,
the shell losing hollowness.

The spiral
is inside itself,
spiraling to know itself,
or known through a sudden cross-section
at a daylight cafe, where there is nothing
on the table, and no one across.

*

You lean toward the city
        and crane
around one of its tilting steps, like a spectator
who looks too closely and overshoots, losing a familiar
figure in the city's bas relief.

She would urge you
to leave that glint of ocean
that appears through parted boards, to look
around for her presence.
              So small is emotion
you see only promise in its rack,
her figure a small flame
dancing on a ramp of dank boards,
enthralled in the byway whose scent is algae,
remnants of tissue,
the mussel's faint breath.
                  You waver
between two levels: the last 
which steps into water, and the lowest 
trickles of crepuscular shops, where you enter, translucent
as wax or shell, a slave darkness
untended,
          its proprietor lost 
as you are lost in the final slump of waterfront,
snug in a wing's hard crook,
            the shell curve
            that leads heart after sight.
These Antipodes call to one's mind
old recollections of childish doubt and wonder.
Only the other day I looked forward to this airy barrier
as a definite point in our journey homewards;
but now I find it, and all such resting places for the imagination,
are like shadows, which a man moving onwards cannot catch.

-from Darwin's Voyage of the Beagle
The dogs do not move today 
and the tallest trees are limp. 
There's a white film on the broad leaves 
of the cottonwood that a boy 
wipes with one finger. His sister 
has a fever and will not rise today.

He notices other clear 
green streaks and thinks that maybe 
these are his sister's, and runs 
to the faucet. His brow has become wet 
and he washes that too.

Only the screen doors are closed. 
He looks in. His mother 
is strangely blurred by the screen 
but the cloth she carries 
is luminous and drops large 
slow drops. For two days

the boy spends his time like this, 
like the clouds that are just 
out there. He will not enter the room 
where snakes startle his sister 
and there are so many days and nights 
in a short time. His sister 
looks new when she wakes.
Lawrence, you astound me, 
like the lawn busy with uniforms, 
white against green, like a spring snow.

I saw you hug the great thigh 
of a nurse who went on talking above you. 
At night, you are above her, 
a little moon-face 
that has slipped through the window. Perhaps

then you are shared by the other children, 
who are this sound of loons 
and peepers 
from the flooded meadow.

Is it morning?
No, it's the birth 
of stone and iron. You begin twelve years 
into your life, a smooth face 
like a rose that leans, sobbing 
on the massive shoulder of a wall.

*

We go single-file 
into the woods, a whisper of boots 
and frost behind me. There's a flutter 
when we pass the gravestones, and another 
over a spill of bricks 
from the tower's doorway. Lawrence 
has his hand in my back pocket 
all the way up the spiral stairs. 
We spread into the light 
and are a next in the battlements, 
a circle of eyes. Except 
there is a double face, 
pale and round, bearded and burned. Lawrence

is the only one who's afraid, 
frozen, his mouth 
like one sculpted for water, from which 
birds explode, echoing down stairs 
and tumbling into the valley.

*

Leaves in their fires colors 
are suspended along the path.

One is a gift for a girl 
whose hand goes to meet it, 
and there's a cut 
somewhere inside 
as she balls it up 
in her fist, then kneels 
to place her palm 
to its palm.

The boy with black hair 
against olive skin is next to her 
collecting blood-leaves, and another 
saves pale alder.

A stranger walks 
through the kneeling children. 
He is like that rock 
loaded with quartz, another light 
in the blue-green thicket.

*

The girls are round 
where they shouldn't be, 
say the nurses: it's an extension 
of the illness.

Those full hips and new breasts 
are now pads on the floors 
of the rooms with drains.

They are still surprised.

What the boys take 
through the tiny windows 
is what they should have.

It is why a dozen 
nurses and doors 
sound alike when they meet

this morning. 
The shining body 
of a girl winds down

Through the meadow, a stream 
of dark boys behind her, and then 
the nurses, large and slow

like snowflakes 
that fall into water, 
or the shirts falling
about the girl.

*

A woman was replaced by her brother. 
She gutted the rooms 
they entered together. There's metal

in her throat and skull, like a gong 
that sounds in the room 
where she calls the brother.

The children are silenced. Downstairs, her head 
is cocked like a bird at attention, and his name 
is out there in silence, beyond

the children's silence. It makes a tour 
of drawing rooms, finds nothing, 
and returns during the rustle 
of lunch, when they are just lifting 
spoons and forks, and putting them down again.

*

She's in her dress of red flowers; 
he in loose gray trousers and a white shirt 
open against a white chest. Their mouths move 
as slowly as her fan. Under the bench 
are a newspaper and a sandwich that fell 
through the slats in a morning shower.

The water-colorist is looking
above them at the green dome 
of the shade tree, dipping her brush 
into a little well between thin lips. 
Her Cupid's-bow is green and cracked 
and all about her are small crushed cups.

At the feet of a man whose head 
shakes No, there's a boy who wants to tell 
something he has memorized, and promises 
to tell only half. He's talking and singing 
under a fist, yanking at a cuff. 
The man topples in silence and even 
the boy's running cannot be heard.

*

Once there was a river entrance 
for supplies, and a manacled wonder 
standing at the bow. 
He could only see 
what was ahead of him, where water 
met the lawn, water lapping 
and the grass lapping back, like hair 
in a bath. The he would rise with the lawn 
to the shoulders of the house.

It fell down around him 
and came up again in stone. 
The house is a room 
he's walking out of, a stocking foot 
and a skeletal foot, shoes and a sock 
in his hands. His right elbow 
holds his pants to his waist; this woman 
is pulling a belt 
from a large brown envelope. 

He feels he should kiss her 
and feels it is wrong. She makes him 
sit down and finish his shoes. 
He thinks he should have the key 
but they are already in the corridor 
and are jostled by a boy 
counting stairs through twelve. The man 
looks in his hand for a kev 
or an address, 
then drifts across the lawn.

*

Yesterday, a toad was sacrificed in the hall. 
Lawrence believed it would get up again. 
He also believes any number 
is a permutation of his birth-date, 
and that the clock celebrates 
only twice a day. He is here now 
in the gown he hates, having pulled me 
by the sleeve to wait with him. There are leaves

tapcd in the hall, a light by the clock 
and one at each iron door. The year 
is approaching snow, the arrival 
of Lawrence's parents. He's my child now 
and is allowed an opcn door 
through which he passes, 
then climbs into a night 
from which someone else 
will take him.
The doctor has inoculated you 
with a mild version of the disease. 
He turns away like the assassin 
in your dreams, and the smell of the classroom 
comes back: chewing gum and the pure sweat 
of children instead of cordite. It's simple 
and stupid how it hinges on one word: shot. You reel back

but the movement is small 
and fluttery, like the butterfly 
in front of a cloud in the stereoscope. 
You take its colors for reality. For a whole day 
trees and stones stand out, nothing has been built

flush and exact, your toes 
are small melons on dirt 
which is like the granules of snow 
in a creche; large fingers 
advance on your lips.

Just when you come back to yourself, 
when you feel wood at your elbow 
and a hate for ceramic dogs, you see your mother 
fall to her knees and hear a new voice. You smile 
before you cry with her, as if you'd brushed 
a dusty velvet curtain.
The boy kicks gravel in his drive 
and up pops a scallop shell. Grave

shadows of cumulus turn it gray, 
but in the sun, country-western,

gospel, and violin love music 
mix like rusty wire and vanish

like a fuse of laden air.
You can almost see a fish drying,

a woman's leg drying, the smoke 
from a stack and from a barbeque.

Saturday morning's first beers 
sweat in all those right hands

while the left ones power-steer. 
You do see the woman's bare leg

and foot stuck out the window, 
so still, and the dune grass

bending over, turning silver, 
like some new revolving world.
The field gathers 
and goes in here. 
Slipping latitudes 
cast doubt on the nearest tree, 
in leaf now or always.

Grass is burned to the river, 
but I follow smoke from another fire. 
It floats over fences that enclose 
the house, a clay pot, the seed.

There are no corners. 
The dimness called "home" 
refuses to turn, goes on out of season,

sticks with the next indefinite step.

*

It was called "Blue River."

A crow 
captures the field, 
noises are disowned, color 
bled out.

My climb 
out of frost into a tree 
brings no reason for looking out. 
Thinking is in that time 
of apples, arboreal happiness.

It was called "Blue River."
And at Blue River 
the water was slow, muddy 
in the same way that night comes.
Frost came but twice
and even the rains were scarce.
A patch of goldenrod 
grew in the watery shadows 
beneath his window. Letters, 
reams of letters were carried 
down the walk from the portico,
his tunnel through the ochre winter.

He scraped at his beard
and was shamed by the dry skin 
that adhered to ink, that fell on the word "sorry."

To whom was he writing? 
Someone distant, all distant, 
his letters borne over the horizon. 
Orion was closer. The garden 
was as distant, the time from seed to harvest 
the same as letter and answer.

"Sorry for the long delay. I 
was busy. I was otherwise occupied. 
The linden felt something today 
and dropped some of its leaves."

The "I" and "thou." 
Last night he dreamt the "I" 
gone to the station to wish "thou" goodbye. 
The station was bunker, a squared hole 
from which the train would emerge. 
He broke down and climbed 
into someone's lap.

The temptation 
was to give dream its lead, 
let it decorate, lose "you" in "they." 
He even waved. The window fogged 
and the garden called him --
its watering, its shade 
a whisper of mountain life.

It seemed flat, pressed 
between thick sheets of cellophane, 
only the grass at his feet 
rising to inhabit the world.

*

Full, though not at flood, 
the river lifted him, 
brought him closer to the canopy 
next to fulfilled banks. The dense hardwood 
was not his symmetry and always seemed low, 
as if to push one into a picnic.

Sprawled, he'd shared a passive feast, 
lost nothing on the cleared ground 
beneath a day-long shade, he and Pasqual 
brimming with aspen, snowfield, and ptarmigan 
while the two women rowed, trolling 
at the edge of the sun-struck channel.

He tossed a rock into the livid green 
and relished the sparks disturbed from its slowness. 
A gust of wind turned the leaves, bleached the sky. 
The ground rushed into the sudden calm, sealed them 
in a vacuum with deadwood, leaves, the women's
scented clothes. But Pasqual and the women 
spoke to him from outside.

He couldn't answer. His mouth was full of bark 
from the stick that held his jaws apart.

*

A girl in crinoline 
watched over him and he worked backward 
to delve into the bundle 
in her lap. Both of them 
were photographed before a carpet 
hung on the line; her hair, parted in the middle, 
made the same dark pyramid as her skirts. 
And beneath those skirts 
her legs broke out in a shallow sweat, 
teased by the knife-edged crinoline. In her care
the baby went bump. Sunlight crept across the yard,
releasing the dank smell of carpet.

*

The unseen orchestra played all night, 
but as the sky is stripped at daybreak, 
so the fundamentals 
fell from his hearing. He heard 
the secondary orchestra, the crystal gears, 
wolf-tone engaged with harmonic. His arms, 
the seen body, reached and grasped 
while he slept, not wanting to wake 
to that vast recessional. 
So the night opened and curled, 
revealing its silver spine. 
he entered and dove 
but did not feel, instead
was stained by darkness. Rising, 
he struck a crystal pipe 
that rang dully, then stumbled 
and the whole night rang.

*

Dear Claire, a late summer & I must get out. 
Anything but yellow air! A kettle 
boiling in the kitchen, that's what I find 
almost everywhere. Last night, when I got off the train,
the grass by the tracks was burning. The smoke 
hung low around the station, but sort of boiled 
at the tunnel. Little red lights 
flickered here & there. Everyone 
was busy & getting  further away, 
as if chasing something into a tunnel. 
And then, Claire, there were two shots --
a nickel-plated revolver. I'd swear that gun 
rose out of the tracks, or from the shiny wheels 
that were now shrieking -- a glint taking shape. 
But there was no one. Down by the tunnel 
water hissed & steam rose quickly. 
What was it, Claire? I walked home 
annoyed by the crickets who knew nothing. 
I know what you're thinking, but now I'll hallucinate 
those fields before you & your Canadian air. The day 
is gaining weight & I must leave you 
for my blessed, though shallow, nap.

*

A Goodyear blimp sputtered across the sky. 
There was a lie about the flash in Nevada. 
Overhead, a year to the day 
from one of those events, B-29's
flew in a V-formation. The pavement was hot 
and the parade uncomfortable 
even in khaki shorts. He burned his fingers 
on the general's green convertible.

He wished for water 
in that miasma of tar and oil. 
He wished for the coolness of the slim blond in white. 
On the long walk home, 
he lay on the first lawn, used it up, 
then ran into the plumber's supply 
and drank long draughts from the fountain 
in a maze of enameled steel, all white, 
all with chromium stubs that drew gallons, columns 
of transparent water, and he was filled with ice 
whose needles begged exit from his flesh.

*

(two voices)

                          He poled north,
stashed the pole and paddled through the narrows.
In this I see my life. Lunch in an eddy
nosed in, bow and stern in crevices.
                            And in the eddies --
they splashed, imitating motion -- I see the possibilities
seized honestly by the senses -- the boat
knocked against the rocks -- the body,
used in that realm, then put back
as what I see now.
       He rocked free, lost ground,
but paddles into a view of aspen. Equivalents
for what was forgotten, and what was forgotten -- stunted spruce
now on a hillock with its skirt of shale -- as sweet
as the possibilities
           that wave as I wave at them.
He slept in the boat he would leave,
                       They are there too
dreamt the smooth round faces
                  in elegant confusion with the seized
drifting over inches of clear water.
Both terror and aesthetics no doubt fuel memory
to spear night and time to that
morning thirty (standard) years before,
but in what form, combination, interplay?

-Marq Dyeth, in Stars In My Pocket Like Grains of Sand, Samuel R. Delany
The home of Judge Roy Bean, 
the crypts at Queretaro, 
the Concord meeting house,

they all breathe the same air, 
that of a barely remembered rain 
or the invisible cloud 
after a scattered pile of leaves.

It is air 
not used to exhalations, 
but one that breathes into us 
and breathes into us 
a long slow intake of breath. Now

does not exist, nor then, 
and we continue breathing in. Take 
it says, and we do, until we topple 
into the headlong future

that never was 
but is with the next breath.
There are the names 
painted on sloping strata, 
white tears sliding toward rainwater.

The beads have collected 
where sky is the final pit. 
There are the holes drilled for dynamite, 
abandoned premonitions.

Now you see forest on the edge, 
threatening to spill over, isometrics 
that raise your head. Up there is a 
rusted crane, and below, 
a steel worm.

Gaze into the pond. It is full 
of false endings, full of those names. 
One is trying to meet its wavering mate, 
a backwards cousin. 
You are the third party.

You can't make them meet. 
The parts like their distance 
and there is already completion. 
They make sense when you go away.
Like the hand of her husband pressing, 
it goes beneath the earth, turns to straw 
the deep white roots. Over the creekbed

come those who watch from the yellowing trees, 
watch as she and the girl break down a length of berm 
and bury the man. She is watched, this girl 
who is the last to shrink within her shadow.

Now someone comes to the maples, 
the ferns in their shade, and the evenly spaced 
piles of rock -- a background like raw canvas.

He fumbles in haste to take the photograph, 
that frame in which rock and leaf-shadow 
go tunneling into the lamp, unremarkable, and he sees 
what he did not see: the broad, flat face of a woman; a girl

who'd lived long in her best dress -- here like a dull goblet 
with its residue of wine. Both of them dull and still, 
aware of him in their hated sun.

*

Though the lenses spilled in haste, 
cast their quick parallax and half-rang 
before hiding in the moss,

he finds them as if displayed, not his own, 
and squats to stare 
at their versions of sky: the only sky 
in the afternoon of woods, the last thing he can see

a muddy finch darting from a branch. The clear way
is the path, where nothing brushes him, where the tilt is forward
and water left or right.  The flat is sudden, almost up,
and light leaks into the darkness.
                         A tiny red sun
wobbles on the asphalt.
Where the dead grass on a hill 
resembles sand or a nude, 
where a strip of sunlight 
comes through stormclouds, no one 
leaves the house on its bright edge 
or the house across the way in evening: 
here is the place to walk with a friend, 
to feel both the sun and the cool damp air.

"The devil is getting married." 
"Ha, well then, it's a short ceremony. 
It's raining."

Odd that it should touch him first, 
then me, that split second magnified. 
We live at neither house, but are trespassing 
equidistant from both, so that perhaps 
both owners are on the phone to each other.

Something about their being on the phone 
brings on the feeling of night. Distance grows, 
the night rolls within itself. Shadows, like dark bars, 
cross their yellow windows. We are lost to them, but     	
       tonight they will lock 
every door and window, 
call ahead and say, "They were headed your way."

In fact, we have turned around. We are leaving 
this sensuous rump of a hill, clearing it
of ourselves so that it will wake as a mere roll
in the aspect of houses, something for the wind
to try its hand at.  Under the clear sky
someone will wake, see the grass lean, and lean after us.
Two bodies lie by a pond that has two shores: one that seems 
casual, with roots, twigs, and leaves that slip under the surface; 
the other formal, its fine gravel raked in sinuous lines, the 
terminus of a narrow road. The bodies are of two kinds -- wood 
and flesh -- and they lie on the casual shore staring at the forest       
umbrella. A carriage comes by the road, stops, and two men step                 
down. They crush around the pond and arrive at the bodies. The 
first man pulls a handmirror from his vest and holds it before the 
fleshy nostrils. The second man simply lifts the dummy by its 
hinged arms and legs, but stops momentarily while the first man 
breezily passes the mirror before the wooden nostrils. The 
dummy is propped in the corner of a seat, then both men slowly 
and clumsily haul the heavier body, laying it on the floor 
between the seats. The ride is bumpy. The ventriloquist does not
move, but the dummy time and again drops its jaw, rolls its eyes, 
and bangs the seat with its heels.
The bulb swings and his melon shadow weighs on the first old 
man he's thrown to the floor. In the silence, while spectators 
stare through dust pounded from the planks, I hear what sounds 
like seeds sifting and settling in the defeated husk.

One then another contestant takes him on, but it's the same as 
before: the shriveled bodies hurling themselves at each other, no 
striking with arms or legs, just the thud of trunk against leathery 
trunk. With his third victory, he makes the slightest 
acknowledgment of my presence, a mere turn that causes all the 
spectators to cheer me and begin slapping my back.

I am surprised and embarrassed by this pride that makes me look 
for him. My comforts call now like waves of heat, drawing me 
from the sulphurous room. He is gone, but again there is that 
sound as of a gourd lightly handled.
Here is the road that has always run on only one side of the 
woods. On the right, the east, are the woods, and on the left is 
the caretaker's house. The caretaker is asleep in his boat on the 
pond just inside the woods. He is visible from just about any 
spot on the road.

From the boat, looking west, the fields are endless. There is a 
slight rise toward infinity, but since the whole horizon does this, 
the imagined dip to the pond becomes physical.

A dotted line across the average middle of the pond would reveal 
a slice of darkness to the east.  It is toward that darkness that a 
man walks purposefully, having stopped at the caretaker's house 
for directions, and who now unbelievably misses the caretaker on 
the pond.

He stops at a hut, enters, and sees a crude shelf on which there 
is a doll with half-closed eyes and crazed porcelain flesh, though 
its body feels like a stuffed bird. He dusts it off and takes it with 
him, continuing his walk until he comes to a road that has 
always run on only one side of the woods.
When the wind finally stopped 
I saw how high the grass had grown.

That didn't matter -- it was the piano 
that was different, better, and fit in 
now between plain and sky.

Its colorless notes 
loved that corridor. They stole 
blue, green, or sometimes ochre 
from distant southern hills.

When company came, 
we lay in the grass 
away from the house, the barn, and the sheds. 
where there was plenty of piano room,

and every note 
in the middle octaves sounded.

Nights fell with a dampened piano, 
dawns broke with endless runs.

There was no end to the octaves, 
no end up or down, and side by side 
infinite pianos dimpled the sky.
He had us follow him and we hid behind the hedge. He 
whispered: "I want you to consider what's in front of your
nose."

There were bees, vertical files of ants, and the odor of decay. 
Through the hedge, we saw a shimmering field, tiny cars that 
whooshed beyond it, palm trees behind the cars, and a white 
horizon past them.

There was a man in the field and his legs and khaki pants 
undulated with the shimmering field. The far palms rattled, the 
field got hotter and seemed to lap against the cars, like an ocean 
against a causeway.

The man walked like a hunter and the hedge followed him, 
dragging its roots, magnifying the odor of decay. The bees fled, 
the ants rummaged in the sweet uprooted place.

Meanwhile, the man raised a rifle and lowered his head to the 
sights. He moved as if along a slot, sliding behind and in front of 
shrubs, then shot and hit a bell, the bullet striking like a 
hammer.

The bell rang on into the night, when the field was brilliant with 
lights and crowds shuffled about. Then he appeared, offering us a 
plaster duck that he carried in white gloves. Its chalky bill flaked 
orange, grew soft, and fell off. The body followed: a soft but 
resistant oval, a mass of feathers, then many small feathers caught
by the wind and scattered among the fields.
It's December and I sit in the office 
trying unsuccessfully to begin the series 
based on topology and attempts to prove 
the Poincare conjecture. I realize 
in staring at the calendar 
that it's been five years 
since I last spoke with you in person. 
The same goes for James A., who writes long, 
single-spaced, unparagraphed letters 
about $99 airfares from NYC to Belgium, 
or Jody, who writes from St. Ives, 
tells me who's been there, and includes 
the fishing report, and Greg's Christmas letter 
is about a translation project in Portland, 
and comes with Volume 4, Number 1, 
of a magazine I've never seen, but which he 
says 
we spawned somehow. I can't figure out 
what he's talking about. It simply looks 
familiar, like another strand of memory, 
as if he's presented one space more 
than the three I can visualize. Or, I've imagined 
one of you sitting here in the cane chair, 
lifting a cup from the polished burl, and you 
have imagined me sitting in whatever chair, 
lifting from a table what I must.
No matter what the ruler 
laid on the map says, 
they are all equally distant. It is the same
from the desert to the granite 
underpinnings of Brooklyn, from this 
volcanic rim to the other, from the fishing grounds 
off St. Ives back to the desert.

One smells the natural abundance 
of azaleas and rhododendrons, 
another the predominant tang of evergreens, 
another orange blossoms and jacaranda, foxglove 
and hawthorn for another, and for one 
a bitter geranium that bends to no wind 
this side of a sooty window.

They wake to the ocean 
shoving rocks around, the conversation 
between wind and mild rain, 
the quiet of a desert whose sounds 
are small and hidden, and the street's 
amplification of motors.

Nonetheless, one day the light 
is nearly the same everywhere. 
The effect is to make the distance 
from windows to the ordinary sights 
exactly what it should be, equal 
to the stone wall from here, or to the naked 
winter elm with its loaded branch.
Camellias bloom 
around the little cul-de-sac,
as if the neighbors had agreed 
some years ago. I see no others

until the short-cut, 
where they bloom in deeper, 
darker yards, and the air 
along the street is cool.

I could drive on 
but turn where I work, where camellias 
once again appear, though whiter 
and ganged up like clouds. They sway

and send perfume somewhere. 
The breeze that moves them 
might reach you tomorrow. It may 
ripple up the slopes

through aspen groves, appear to 
rest, then return as the room 
that seems suddenly cleared.
We live
with one page of the calendar
and an hour
is a coupling of voices,
much like the random lighting
of lamps below a plane:

seeing them 
links them, and the darkness 
with them as well.

How does one arrive 
here so happy? If you take 
the little round lights 
and turn them, they are the same.

They have no flat places 
so you might set them down. 
This is why 
people look at us, you there, me here.

We carry the same thing 
and it is all we can do to 
explain.
The whole thing is somewhat easier now, 
addressing you, and not talking to the idea.

This morning the day arrived 
like a pale yellow plate 
over the industrial end of town, 
and the cold smell of leaves 
slipped over the transom.

It was all that was required 
to cause a break, to have me observe 
that the digital clock and courthouse chimes 
didn't match, and that it was time to begin.

The "Perspectives" section 
of the paper almost cancelled 
the Poincare conjecture --
something about "Radiation 
Equivalent Man."

It was another idea, like a shelf of smoke 
above a little town, tucked in and battling winter.
It is like leaving toys 
in the little yellow house, 
built for a mother-in-law 
and now rented in six-month spells.

It is barely visible from uphill, 
like a dime-store amethyst 
suspended in a green nap, 
nestled in the grid 
of gray and buff streets, 
with the model railroad 
going, cutting almost center 
in the town growing up.

It is of growing up 
that we speak, gaining conviction 
from the aerial view. This spring 
is the one of blackened tulips, 
limbs cracking under snow. 
Will you take 
another six-month lease, 
or sit longer on this hill?

This summer 
is the one of fires held back, 
the one of spontaneous roses.
I've cut the string. The kite levitates. It hangs right in there at 2
o'clock, its red vibrant against the blue sky.

The birch bends beneath it. We are all in the wind and my link
with the kite is strong. I can't bear to look down. My body feels
the gusts and I become very aware of my ribs. The kite is
motionless but I sense its minute pulse, its love with the wind.

Sal, my neighbor, comes out in the late afternoon and feels the
air around me. No strings, Sal. No fishline, no radio-control.
The damned kite just hangs there.

Almost evening, the sky a cobalt blue and the red kite with a
halo. Sal has binoculars and is examining the kite for ailerons.

Let Sal demonstrate wonder: I am as buoyant as the kite. There's 
the bodiless voice of my neighbor, and myself, an ethereal
witness, totally satisfied, thankful I have no hands to caress the
kite.

Sal says I have a martini in my hand. Thanks, Sal. I lift it
without looking at it, feel a tingle at my lips, then with one
hearty gulp toast the kite. The feeling is impossible, like an ice
cube floating in air.

It is evening and only I can see the kite, that diamond shape
where there are no stars. In the morning there are no stars, and
no kite. But there is space for another.
The windows in space/time:
where an "event" is the window from the accessible past
into the inaccessible future, and to the side --
the walls, if you will, of this largest of rooms --
are the inaccessible past and likewise
inaccessible future. The present, then,
is like a blind brother to the event,
and they are separated only by the sheerest membrane.

A cicada impaled on a sparrow's beak
does its thousand rattles
to rival the calls of the fledglings who eat it.

The old man
thinks the cicada is inside
and the bird outside, both alive,
though the cicada is not where it should be.

This effects his day.

All day he turns his ear
to the beginning of any sound: the trowel
in his wife's hand at the garden,
the turning of the cock for water.

Can the sun
make such a sound,
warming the dry leaf into a dish?

It is the quiet
that concerns him now,
the quiet broken by his daughter,

who is even now
close enough to be heard
but must come nearer; who, with the mother,
stands just the other side
of his ear and stares

into the smoking hole
of the evening's first meteor.

*

He yearns for the night porch
and its droning silence,
where the large family
is safely contained and seems
an afterthought in the thin house.

He remembers blue stick-figures
completed by the movement
of males in heavy snow,
the night pushed out, the chrysalis
worked to brittleness, a body
breaking into night
even as the jerky figures
pulled snow over the world of Lu Chou.

The woman who is not here
inhales the scent of blossoms
that explode with the train's speed.
       From the space
between two coaches, she sees again
a configuration of lake, volcano,
and heavily flowered shore.
It is the image of each day
       and once again
she expects the interminable green,
the lianas and their variegated darkness. This time
       the flowers lash
at the tight little city, a knot
that contracts, then unravels, 
revealing at its center a sad horse
that turns in fences of tin:
       one last night,
she thinks, and the train climbs,
slowing on the flank of a cone
that is the twin of another,
       and on the lake
she imagines a plume of smoke
from the locomotive. Fire joins fire
in the water, like the red pistil
of an enormous flower
       that dips into itself.

In Lu Chou's childhood, the executioner
would play with two small helmets,
tiny bowls, really, sewn from the hind
found on the mountain. In them,
the sky had been reduced 
to twelve large stars.
The pomegranite
had more; none in the orange
whose empty rind lay beside him.

But when, in his forgetfulness,
he turned inside-out one spangled shell,
the seeds of light were as his charges,

halved, halved again,

faster than the axe, invisible
in the double hood of night. 
I could begin with the owl or the cage,
the courtyard or summer,
though summer encompassed them all,
pumping its long days and short nights
into the blood, until one begged
for a longer night. Like summer,
the tall grasses and weedy elms
swallowed almost all the courtyard contained,
shone through the overgrowth, and whose black
In that one cage, the Great Gray lived
its unnatural life, turning and peering
in its extended night, waiting for the clicks of the wheel
and the great chimney of the courtyard --
to lift, if it can, past the second floor,
the third floor, and the vents and ducts
of the science building, to discover
night's walls rushing past the stars.

unfeeling silent
forever denying itself

*

before the ageless cityscape
exactly skyblue silk

and silvery cloth
the shirt and short pants

flapping on the lover
at an eastside window

sun-dogs and river-stars
wake of a hover-craft

blend in the cataracts of an octogenarian

swirl on the planet
that was younger with her

older with him and I
met them both

can look from The Silver Shout
to her recognition

there in the spray
by the river the boat

lifts its prow
raises its hull of air and water

of fire twin stars
gliding downriver

*

Mercury in the ninth house
I think and near Perseus

I see the crystalline
layers of trines

this tied to this and that
the sharp breath of winter

stealing breath
like the moment of hoarfrost

and with its sound
I don't know what this has to do 
with another unfinished thing, 
but I saw in a dream the last 
of a series of homes. It came 
stripped of 200 years of history, 
a red dusty road going to the end 
of its course as it does in real life; 
its banks, because it seemed a dry bed, 
were contoured as they are now -- peopled, 
built upon, littered with the future. 
I traveled with a shadow-person, as is 
often the case in dreams, playing cars 
with real cars which shouldn't have been there, 
but which he, fleshed now as a stranger, 
wanted to move from atop a bank 
into the dusty road with the strength 
and expediency of dreams.

In the switching yard of dreams, 
I accepted this research as a magnesium flare 
shadow-person did not see. I had 
the road to myself now, followed it, 
ate up history, and came to the houses 
that were as they are now: endangered, 
but also blessed, by a window. In time, 
among the jokes, the deaths, and affairs 
of those who live there, I will say, 
because I am caught with them, 
I had a dream about this place.

A village bell-tower was sleepy.

It wrapped itself in a little band of trees, counted to
three and fell asleep.

When it woke up, there were no more than a few trees,
with silver dew under their armpits.

A large burnt paper cross was branding its forehead.
The nobleman steps down from his carriage.

It's a district in the mountain valley.

The white shapes of old hands knit caps for thousands
of spice-boxes.

At the manor, the animals are dressed up.

The fox is in a tuxedo, a russet flame between his
tails.

The nobleman lights candlesticks and eats rabbit stew.
The dormouse was an ice-floe of the mammoth era.

The wind turned leaves in the washed linen.

They heard the sun approach and withdraw, with a solemn
step, like organ music.

At lunch, the decanter's cork shone under the acetylene
burner, naive as a pear.

After searching a long time, the children found a
hunter, lost, upside-down among branches.

Very far off, in the bends of old roads, some robbers
with a sack and a club cried: "Your money or your
life!"
He gently does his angelic work.

The school has four walls and its windows play
dominoes.

Daytime opens its laughing drawers: yellow battles,
slow cards, wise measures, sleeping gloves.

Then, evening glides on the blue and white icing, his
slate scribbled with animals and heads.

Bob's toy-box contains a target, nails from wooden
shoes, gelatin balls, a picture with a hunter in a
derby hat.

At night, Bob sleeps in a little puff-pastry boat.
After exhausting itself with white dust on the roads
and bilberries in the wood, great summer, disarrayed
and weak, is pulled in through the roof, through its
wicker hall shaped like a hoop-net. Now, it's
neglected: ant-eggs clog its nose and a sore beard
pushes them up to the slots of its eyes, a beard of
rotting branches that's called autumn.
The blue glasses, found in an elevated railroad car,
belong to the victim, Lady Morton.

But Nat and the coroner, misled to the black windows in
depots, re-enact the daily routines of her double.

The job hinges on a leaking cask, painted red, with
mysterious contents.

There's also a garret, a furnished hotel overrun with
nettles, padded doors, a secret platform.

All the action happens on Tuesday, poor day, stamping
on the rain's filings.

Guided by a jockey, Nat discovers the culprit in a
phoney pastor's osier suitcase.

He's a horrid dwarf, of Mongolian ancestry. The pastor
is his lieutenant.
The soup with jonquils that's eaten at the fairies'
house, a dull little spoon gave me the recipe.

One evening it lured me under its raincoat. In the
dark, against its heart, a little light was living. A
weak little reddish flame, surrounded by a blue halo.

It's her -- I've understood it ever since -- she's who
hummed me the recipe.

Alas! My gasp was so strong that she died from it.
She's morning's residence. She's as clear as she is
invisible, as tranquil as forgotten lands.

Her hair is golden, her smooth windows exchange
glances.

She appears in bold alluring colors, a pretty basket of
dew, protected by a long crystal rifle.

On the doorstep, a bush shakes off his medals.

The door is open, but the bush hesitates forever: he
doesn't see he's invited.

Gently, the house empties, she jingles her dress, her
heart rustles: the dazed bush doesn't understand.
It's a very complicated game.

From time to time, the glass rifle speaks all alone and
shatters some small thing.
What was it a question of? A hair's breath, in all.

A tree was catching fire, a pond was sulking, a dew
sprinkled maid-servant was lulled to sleep by currant
bushes.

What was it a question of? A tiny line. Compact little
figure, naked Merisette.
When the dawn's heart begins to beat, the high little
clouds come down to breakfast in the trees.

                                *

Behind the masked clouds playing the big drum, real
clouds, still and caught in dreams, are hushed up.
They are the sky's memory.

                                *

Tired from wandering alone in the roadless sky, a dark
cloud has gone to die in the forest.
Thursday is always pleasant with frost and a naked girl
on the country's palm.

The merchant of clouds counts the precious stones of
the amazing house: an inviting lamp.

The girl in the forest, brief snow-maid dressed in
fire, in a leaving-coat.

The white trees are listless.

The house is a log, the merchant, Stout John, like the
wind.
An uncle smokes a pipe, blows smoke, knows his target.

An abbot traces a lion, builds a cardboard cone.

The oldest child studies his shoulder joint.

A mother puts on her huge thimble, picks up a needle,
yawns.

A neighbor brings in a display of horns that just lies
about, tells of his journey from Austria, drinks.

A table gloats in quarters.

A child lies in ambush in a house.

A house has a thousand windows.

Heavy weather throbs in a countryman's cloak.
We were hoping to spend Saturday in the parlor in
Arabian sacks.

It used to have a ladder under its arm and a trowel as
shoulder-belt.

The clock rang carefully, with an odor of preserved
pears.

A piece of thread was loafing on an armchair: it was
the week's pay.
I kill the third bird while watching myself in the
glass.

The first I had taken for a chair, one of those folding
chairs which sometimes flutter between the hooks of the
mirrors.

I heard the second's peck through the keyhole.

I found it squashed against the back of the glass, the
mender of faces. It was clear as oblivion.

The third was the breast of the mirror itself.

It was flapping a thousand blinding hands, a thousand
hands of fire.

I was forced to close my eyes. It died because of them.
Saturday always means a pail of open oysters and a
gaping plank, over there, in the corner of the wood
where Oger, the staircase-maker, lives.

His wife Octavia washes with the black soap and eats
the raw, chilled comb of a cock killed during the night
by an axe-stroke, on the bakery block.

His drunken son Oscar has a sore throat. He set up a
cutting table in the cabbage patch. He licks the
almanac. It smells bad.

The carpenter has bare fore-arms. He whistles between
his teeth.

He thinks about his brother the peddlar's tired horse.
He dreams of his daughter Odile, dead at fifteen, from
hemorrhaging.

Heaven is pale, its cheek swollen, with waterpockets
under its eyes and a bandage on its calf.

In the evening, a preserved egg is eaten.
A cuckoo, larger than the forest, digs a hole in the
still warm, ashen landscape.

The butt of a rifle spreads over the arrogant
mountains.

A wisp of straw is placed as observer at the side of
the hole.

A guinea-hen's eye, detached from its body, serves as a
signal.

The eye reddens: the butt coagulates, the cuckoo's
feathers gather in a very furious four-fourths
movement.

The straw glitters a long time in the complicated
fistula of the sky's deserter.

Thus, in the morning twilight, the winter cuckoo is
sucked in by his surroundings.
He followed, point by point, the instructions on the
hand-bill.

Carefully, prudently, he folded the paper in quarters,
then in tens, then again in a thousand equal little
triangles.

His work finished, he hid, for the night, under his
pillow.

Even so, in the morning a woman he didn't know was
washing, shamelessly, in front of his mirror.

In the mist, a quiet finger had drawn the curly head of
a ram.

The paper, folded so many times, had disappeared.
In times of swollen cheeks, when the clay bugles roar,
the little railroads of gold coins run, in festoons,
around the country.

Oh beards of fire, oh streams rousing the thirst!

But, at the heart of the region, among the mold growing
under arms, milk-filled celebrities of the white wood
nourish the lumpy pillow of sleep which dents the young
cows.
The felled tree still has a tree house.

It also is left supporting this or that branch, with
its birds.

But the birds die off and the trestle reaches the top,
the home will still be a sign of what has no form, the
tree being, besides, overthrown.
He takes a rather spacious meadow, with a sky to match.

He sits in the south or at the back, according to
whether his partner is tall or missing.

If he falls, it's water-eating.

If he leaps, it's dancing.

He wins when his partner goes off and doesn't return.

He loses when his partner sits down to the table while
taking his shoes off.

It's a draw when the players resemble the game.

It's also played in the thicket (with planks) or in the
mountains (with nets).
Two ladies climb the lower street.

One is dressed in black, the other in black, the third,
undressed.

These ladies are charged with mounting the lower
street. The street is so low that it takes, thus, four
ladies to climb it.

After climbing the low street, the five ladies go down
it again.

To ruin the lower street seems to be the purpose of
these half-dozen stylish ladies.
I would feast on scoundrels and fall into step.

When the cage was parting from the bird, I was arriving
at my encounter.

When the kennel was eating the dog, I confused bodies
and belongings.

But, in broad daylight, I recovered my distance and
usually got ahead of myself.
We'd grown wiser. We might have become nosegays, on the
day's silver lattices.

When someone rapped on our door, we heard the noise in
our hearts.

We ran to open. There was never anyone.

It was always morning, mild, settled, clear, which
threw us the pearls in its eyes.     

Because our visitors no longer had business at the
doors.

They sprung from our looks, from our furniture, in
their Sunday best, marvelous.

They always wore flowers in their buttonholes.

They were sparkling or invisible, actors of light or
musicians of shadows, to our liking.
Look out! This is not a bouquet: it's a huge concerto
for all the cocks.

Aroused from a daze, on the untouchable stone of dawn,
at noon it sets fire to the structure's main beam.

Then it climbs, unquenchable, spreads, flings itself
into the azure depths, down to the frenzy of the
bottom, down to the wheel's center where red is the
heart of blue.
Step-ladder, tiny pyramid for miserly hunchbacks, near-
sighted reckoner, the reseda, gathered in its cunning
little cabin, breaks up, clears itself of perfume.

This flower is the friend of silent eyes, of century-
old hands, of honest blades.

She grows near modest shale-like clusters -- these,
devout, dyed purple, or else those, burnt to brown
ribbons, daughters seen from a libertarian star.

When the limed soil turns toward the sexton, the weekly
herb heralds, at the bottom of some old fashioned desk,
some thin copy-book bound in boards of somber blue and
covered with beautifully written secrets.

When she's moved by a ridge of fired peat, the flower
forecasts for the initiated only such a display of
nymphomania, such nutritious folly, nauseating tropical
inheritance.

And when she becomes incrusted in the millennial
foundations of bits of shale, she's the prophetess of
the glass reed, the measly pot, the head schoolmaster,
the starched virgin, the pigeon-breeding spiritualist.

Her perfume is a secondary condition since its
disproportion to her stem and its continual layers make
it unexplainable.
A trapped fawn: I fix her up, I dress her, I help her
recover, I imprison her in a tower. I suckle her with
the moon, bits of riddles, wasted blows.

When it's windy, we travel on our mares of lace.

When it rains, we climb, in slow spirals, to tease the
nightingales with a stick.

When the doors, like women in fallen gowns, exchange
their passwords, we unfold in green, in grey, in jerks,
piece by piece, like the perforated music roll of a
player piano.

I call her Mamzelle Impossible. I stuff her with food.
I send her out to beg.
Standing up, weightless, Ponce has walls.

They're thin. They tremble. It's a forest.

These are princes washing themselves, unsettled
quarrels, or a lot of Chinese peddlers.

He makes his move. He spreads out. He's in Naples, in
cherries, in Dumas.

He forms his woman and he forms all: all forms.
I've only known one emperor in my life. He called
himself Zenon and did odd jobs at my parents' house.
He worked only at night.

During the day, he hid. Sometimes we caught a glimpse
of him, under a disguise. I'll always remember the
orphic throne's silence and all I didn't see, behind
the delightful picture of kittens hanging on the wall.

He left us one October morning, a long time ago. We
found the remains of his crown in the pear tree. When
he left, he blocked up the low door of the garden.

I know nothing more to tell about this emperor. And if
I've written that his name was Zenon, it's out of
friendship for those who speak of gilded armor when
they return from the goat-herds.
It's a February morning. The snow is famous.

He burns some coffee.

The teacher sketches the Ural Mountains.
The mother of the newspaper salesman cries a little,
without turning the light on. And he, in the attic,
pours kerosene on some papers. He's a free-thinker. His
sister is pious. She lost her hair one year from
typhoid fever. She's housekeeper at the Jolimont
asylum.
On summer evenings, the king's daughter is liable to
pass.

The pebbles keep a sharp eye.

The switchman goes home to bed. His beard catches fire.
The puppeteer offers him smelling-salts.

It's clear again, with sulphur of bat, in the lower
room where the inn-keeper's straw mattress mildews.
The soldier is sad down to his last button, on his
special uniform for handling fire-arms.

The soldier, slightly stricken with ataxy, finally
manages to sit down on an isolated hillock. He sighs.
He drops a tear, from the bottom of his heart, into his
gun barrel.
King Louis is deaf as a pot. King Louis is seated on
his rear, before his large window. He watches a
hunchback pass who carries a torn handtowel to the town
hall.
In Laetare, the druggist wakes a dead man with his
trombone.

His wife puts her curlers in a pig's bladder.
When she's tired playing nicely with her adopted
cousins, Nijni's daughter gets up, lights a taper, very
proudly leaves her companions and goes into the next
room, to make ugly faces in front of her mirror.
My God, the garden and its jasmines has been pleated
until it's no larger than a happy little hand, playing
with the floral-patterns of the center bedroom, whereas
a dainty butterfly, with the end of his satin wings,
does his housework all by himself.
In a village worn down to its church steeple, the
mischievous wind rolls its acorns under the door of a
hermitage and tears the winter covering from a
vulnerable easychair, wandering after its face.
The chairs? White, of course. With pretty little
trombones. And cabbage-bows, to honor the party behind
the elephants, important gentlemen, courteous, carried
away with pleasure, and quick enough to leap the
railing, the servants before their most obliging eyes,
maids and their children.
The white house is all black. The black house is all
white. They dwell in the same fable. They naturally
look alike.

Their name is patience. They contemplate their
landscape. They open up in closing.

They are dressed separately. They live in each other.
They keep away from large stars. They never trade
places.
One would be tired, the other was also, but bodily. The
tired man was doing absolutely nothing. The other
seemed to act the same, though involved in various
tasks. The man who did nothing was married. The other
was also, with this slight difference, however, that he
remained strictly celibate. As a husband he lived
alone, in appropriate company. The other lived alone
too, but in a promiscuity of about three thousand make
believe people. They both belonged to the secret
society of similar cases.
The lobster is a bird on stilts, in the species of
nighthawks. He drinks cranially, is well developed, has
been pointed out by LinnÇ under the name of Forge
Roussel. Its body shows 4/5 generally animal. The
hindquarters are composed of a cluster of 17 metal
spools, on divergent axles. The lobster is the only
carnivorous bird that flies backwards.

His characteristic song, which resembles, but is
harsher than, the civet-cat's, is produced by a spur's
vibration in the cranial box, called the sub-machine-
gun. The lobster's calcified eye is used, in
shoemaking, to fasten half-boots.
The valise is a female greyhound of the water-hen
family. Essentially transportable, she's distinguished
from the water-hen community by the fact that she
doesn't live on dry ground.

Her nest, or strap, is made with scraps of untanned
hide that the animal gathers with the help of its
transom, coming out of the very tough beak, usually
devoid of the feathers which end the spine. The
valise's nest is gigantic and has very particular
architecture. It's composed of a cupboard and a closet,
connected by a vestibule or macaroni.

The valise reproduces in the closet. In the cupboard,
after the egg-laying season, she breaks up her
youngsters according to height and looks after them
from the macaroni.

The valise's insatiable appetite makes her a very
dangerous animal. Her capture, however, is easy. Full,
she lets herself be lifted like a feather and can be
carried off without showing the least defensive
instinct. In Holland, the valise's skin is used for
wrapping cheeses. 

The valise hasn't any cry, except for the diplomatic
valise, which is multi-lingual.
He places the maid of his works in the sunlight. She is
born, like several others, in Cortil-Noirmont. This
locality must be considered as existing.

In the sunlight, the maid improves. During the
unfolding of the maid's improvement process, the author
of the works visits the grottoes of Cortil-Noirmont. As
opposed to the locality itself, the grottoes of Cortil-
Noirmont must be considered as non-existing.

Completely improved, the maid becomes a mark of honor
reuniting the author with his works. The meeting
doesn't take place in the grottoes of Cortil-Noirmont.
The meeting takes place under the same improving sun.

The world underbark has long been night.
Roots are a bareknuckled boxer's hands
                  in asphalt; now as in a negative
they are silvering. Knots turn
to diamond chips.
The amputated twig
is a trident of latten
that would spear trampling feet.
Tempests rush through distended limbs,
a tendrilous glowing
diffused on brickscape
where thrown crabapples cling.
And once when lovers passed
this arbor an owl laughed;
small birds sang.
Wind-creased they froze that way.
Our lines were the ribbed underbelly
of a neglected pet.
Against morning indigo, shirts
held their breath from our dream sleep.
Crucified with crude pinnings
they stiffened, rimed
in ragged entrails.
Our pants shriveled and seamed,
paraplegic in their pose.
Stilt-legs incised the air;
stuffed handkerchiefs bloomed
from backpockets like cold, folded roses.
Once more we took them down,
cuffs still-lifed and clamped
in rigor mortis. With cellar warmth
our clothes sagged again, the frumpy remnants
of what we had worn.
They held our sleep longer than we,
and grayer by hours
we tended them back to our mortals' motions.
Wrinkles released, our shirts unaged,
and we thawed, wringing the night from our sleeves.
Sawmill floor unshaven, chips shoelace deep,
hardwood releases
the strength of everything
it holds. Sanding over knags
I feel the wounds soften, Beowulf
binding Grendel's hacked shoulder.
I dissect it, my eyes quadrupled
behind plastic; roughened fingers peel
the phloem away,
the cell-skin letting go, opening
to heartwood
and the bone that cannot bend.
Its rings trace the hardest winter
and most casual summer.
The bark saved for soil,
trim-ends untangle; slabs restrain
the seasons of my life,
now lost in edgings.
Beyond the cemetery
sunset hangs in tiers on tilted windows.
Vents spit dyes on the dirt
that had driven deer in season, drays,
and the sodden hands of desperate farmers.
Hidden beer cans cluster
in unchecked weeds.
                                                       With the sun at angles
the headstones are oblique;
shadows double their image
so the ones buried,
bodiless, are without their callings,
their labors anonymous,
almost unworth
the face of ground.
                                                 After hours
the dry grass disentangles.
Moonlight blanches those Biblical names,
the markers grown hide-thin.
The same wind will dry their dust,
their epitaphs, to dry the hands
of sweatbacked men at their cutters,
their forearms weaker
                                                 than the driest blades.
"Condemned" signs mask posters,
cosmetic webs on ticket-booth windows.
Velvet ropes coil about the arms
of the hardhats,

the gum-pocked chairs brought out
for auctioning.
Hoping
to glimpse the screen in full day
we stand as close as we can,

adjust our vision to the light-dark.
Celluloid strips
come back to dimension;
ticket wheels unravel,
reeling our old silences into the street,

our dim, kept ambitions
clipped from frames.

Stiltingly
this work goes on,
our own faces pale
in the absence of heroes.
A blue light buzzes
with each burnt moth, snapping
the way a bartender unfolds
dollar bills. Cats sulk in
the lame grass, their mouths
whiskered even more. I exhale,
and smoke ties bows around the mirror.
Looking back, I see houses in half-light
like Halloween masks
dwindling into miniatures.
Shins of telephone poles stagger
into distances.
Abandoned cars have crept upon
one another, and rusted into uselessness.
The drone of wasps deafens the woods.
Mosquito-thick headlights
wash the road amber.
My skin is gray.
In my bones something sleeps.
Their backs hammock sunset,
and with imperial glances they look at
the uneaten grass, their nostrils
pinching the white air.

Bales are the piratical chests they covet.
Blinders gone, the trails hoofed down,
they shake their pulled-at manes
like dustmops.

They need no fences, even saddle-stripped.
Their haunches unflex in the weight of just themselves,
the marks from dulled spurs
still stinging a little.

But they know the time shadows lengthen,
and are judicial. They imagine
the stirrups corseting their ribs,
the bits between teeth,
then they let their shadows grow

with their silence.
As they eat,
carrying a belly or a backful,
they nuzzle the grass,
and need no fences.
Unbridled,
they are along the snow line
where silence draws a whitened path,
the reins loosened
from the hands of sleeping men.

The dawn is symmetric in their eyes.
Their manes drip from them,
frozen to their last gallop.
Icebits cling like pollen
from the last storm.

Perhaps the fear of slaughter
has brought them here.
Barbed strands spike
in a quietus
of their coming.

Braced eight hands high
their tree stands stripped for switches.
Hooves crunch over
hardened circles; scarred shanks stumble
over buried habits,

over silence that swirls
through the leviathan elms.
Beyond, their stalls are empty.
They cannot falter,
not this time.
Chocolate wrappers lie among leaves
and cored apples.

Pushed up from the ground, stalks
lean impuissantly. Egg yolks

dry on car windows, pastelling
the new air. The stuffed men

on porch roofs belly over embryonically,
like the war dead, some decapitated,

their bruised rinds of skulls
battered like pumpkins.

Satan's mask hangs from a phone pole.
The wind embodies it.
Gorgon-headed,
wriggling in the marsh, the growth
dense as the bristles on a sloth's back,

it has nothing but its breadth
of body,
threatening the stammer of minnows
that rush anywhere
from its wake.

When you net one,
its countenance stares you down
on your own soil,

daring the dry air to subsume it,
its gills puffed, haughtily
dethroned. Still it resists,

and in your whole waterless domain
its visage stalks
one like you.
Moving through rooms filled with midnight
I wear my grandfather's robe.
Five years gone he sleeps shoeless, digging into himself,
sorting the dirt damp with let-go roots.
He left his fingers dangling from a thread of this robe,
his slippered wakefulness catching a cat by the scruff,
shuffling across unnailed floorboards;
then feverish throughout his flesh
he turned thin as handkerchiefs.
Tonight I smooth the frayed elbows and knot the rope
stretched loose from a settled waist.
vicariously we walk in the same skin,
the collar goitered from things left unsaid.
The housewalker sleeps with open eyes.
The waitress's hand seems Formica hard.
Erasures from her smile
crease her cheeks without expression.
Conversations run
like broken eggs. From the highway
smoke ushers in
a formless man, his closed lips
telling where he's been.
His blood becomes coffee
in heavy cups.
Tintinnabula lingers
in the ear
and in the bent prongs
of once-stolen forks.
In forgotten sunglasses
neon repeats itself in reverse.
Fingers pass
over initials etched forever
in some dented chrome.
Trees without root; birches arch, crown to dirt,
Scratching hieroglyphs in the snow.
Shrubs ossify; their thickened twigs grit
At the sculpted smoke of branches.

Wires are down, suturing the lacquered stones.
Weighted with absence, clotheslines sag,
Stiffen. The sheets that canopied seedlings
Have shriveled into bruised pears.

All night I heard the splinter of unknown things.
The woods had whitened, shredding into disarray.
Morning cages the window. The suet left for
Grackles stays wrapped to a warped elm.
Deer, entering the field, will leave no prints,
Only hunger when they  leave.
And one, this happened years ago, occurred
With five mares getting electrocuted.
Electrocuted! The milk truck severed
A low-hanging wire, a main line that fed
The house and barn. The sparks it sent up
Made the horses run, frightened, to the fence

(That was barbed), a conductor from the top
To fencepost, and they didn't have a chance.
We found them huddled and scorched, and their eyes
Stared at death the way, I suppose, ours would.
The silence is so loud when something dies,

And it never has come to any good.
Their manes were stiff as bristles, then the boys
Took them to be put away like toys.
Crows bend in the air
like stripped umbrellas.
Fireweed strands into
the forehead of the
clearing ground; acorns
that swelled over a
rainbarrel are the black
pearls that necklace
the lost calf.

Too quick to rot, an
axehandle has been
charred into the shin-
bone of anything that
couldn't leave itself.
Tilted slats are the
tobacco-black teeth
of drunken farmhands.
Their fingers claw at
the weakened boards,
almost anxious
for decay.

A cycle left wedged
in a beam is skinned
in new rust; it cracks
as a boot kicks at it.
Hinges creak louder.
The rickets of old things
make them snap at any sound.
The caught owl swings
pendulously, alive
in its silence and
dead in our hands.
Pressed cider ages
in its vat.
The trees,
varicose,
haven't yet
known their foliage.
Hoarfrost seeps
between slats,
the springhouse
stumped

like a smiling
whittler's
one tooth,

its public road
cow-drawn
stamped down
with crescent hoofs
and wheel ruts
slicing

into a season
that just begins
or ends.
Once twilight
dwindles to a needle's eye
it catches the flower vase, opaque,
a sentinel
on the parlor's coffee table.

There's a smattering --
a constellation settled in the hard-cornered glass,
embering as though it kept camp
with cosmos --
Jupiter rising to a milkweed stem,
and then an eclipse:
a cat's tail passes and darkens
eternity,

but brings with it
stirred dust
and a manifold moon, daguerreotyped,
quartered by translucence,

in its own phases clocking the protracted shadows
lengthened by a lowered shade,
with the universe contained.
Off the turnpike their burial grounds thicken.
Cracked windshields are webbed white,
and grills grin
with rabid iron. Disemboweled engines,
scavenged for parts, spurt frayed wires
draining the last of the anti-freeze.
Bald tires wreath the spaces
where skunks will curl in summer.
Convertibles have couched upon one another,
flat and identical,

while among burnt and rusted doors
a slashed seat sprouts grackles.
In my soapskinned mug the draught's head withers.
The ventilator belches forth no fumes,
and drunken jokes spear the cigar-ash air.
Filled ashtrays overflow
like mushroom gardens untended,
their heads toward some flickering light.

Through neon doors someone  lets the night in;
it no longer stammers,
and among the fresh sawdust
overalls shuttle past
on thick-soled shoes.
In morning light
A moth floats lazily,
Doubling itself over pondwater.
Leafage splits the mossed-over surface
That moves slowly, unwinding
Like threads from a shawl.
Cocoons muscle the overhanging trees
That brush water,
Playing for the sun as it rises
>From the wren's nest
Adamantine with new eyes.
Along the outworn path frogs rest
Under shaded stones,
Their tongues licking at horseflies,
While light commands
Sound and searching, wind and comfort.
And in the thickest of woods
chainsaws hum like bees.

Pork
For The One Man Who Likes My Thighs
I want a boyfriend with antlers. 
(I read somewhere if I long in specifics, I'll be more likely 
to get my wish.) A boyfriend like Bambi, he'll be the one for me. 
He'll have sort of a feminine name 
so I won't immediately think of cuss-words and muscles. 
Yet he'll battle for my honor, save my life if he has to. 
And when he fights, he and his opponent will turn into shadow. 
He'll never be offensive. He'll have really good posture, 
hold his head high. He'll look like me, but not cuter: 
I'll have longer lashes and bigger bluer eyes. 
He'll have seen a loved one die, so he'll understand loss 
but will have worked through his grieving by the time we meet. 
Yes, he'll be a prince. He'll think of me only and give me twins 
as calm and easy to take care of as no-iron sheets.
The static cracks like whips over lions 
as the nurse yanks a comb through my hair. 
Since I've come, I'm most interested 
in things that aren't there. 

The trick for remembering opposite colors: 
I stare at the lemon soap dish for hours and blink 
grape-purple dots in the porcelain sink. Then, I scout 
the halls for him. He's Sleeping Beauty and I am the Prince. 

I have some sense that kids don't always live, but he will 
if I visit him, insist that I am too in the sixth, not fourth, grade 
and borrow text books to cinch my new made-up age. 
Mornings he speaks in whispers. His chest barely lifts 

the sheet. Then, at noon, it's time for me to breathe 
into the asthma machine. As the liquid in the cup I hold turns 
to mist, I play with the coils of hose looped in my lap 
and watch the dials to see how many pounds I can breathe. 

I could be testing my strength for him at the carnival game, 
sending a marker up the thermometer-shaped gauge, 
ringing the bell until I'm dizzy with exhales. 
My horizontal boyfriend. He's thirteen and he actually talks to me. 

With my chin on his bed rail, I listen to secrets -- 
his father in a strip joint; "Busty" Somebody 
placed a breast on top of a bald patron's head. 
I wonder about where the contact hasn't been: 

if my hand could fit under his neck, 
through that dark tunnel formed where his scalp hits 
the pillow and where the mattress meets his back. 
I follow the bridge over his lip and plan 

a hazy rescue, a nebulous kiss -- 
It's late and I've snuck into his room. 
He's sleeping; but suddenly I'm not so sure 
what to do. It's the first time 

I've wanted to touch someone and couldn't. 
I'll still see his profile laid out in landscapes, 
the blond snow-dust on his cheek 
by the precipitation of light falling from his humming tv.
In the Stadium Theater, a movie about Santa Claus 
going to the moon in a rocket. My mother doesn't want to see it, 
but takes me after I beg her and beg her. It is the first day 
I'm not wheezing for a while, and she hesitates 
bringing me outside, but we make it. Sudden temperature changes 
can kick me off, like bee stings in summer 
or walnuts in a friend's birthday cake. I know I can die 
any number of ways. I saw a casket the length of my sled 
whisked down the steps of Founier's Funeral Home. I belong 
in a glass globe, where the snow isn't cold, 
where my lungs can't constrict so easily, shying from life. 

I wake up in hospitals sometimes -- my skin, pale green, 
and my mother shows me my face in her compact. 
There is a crayon called seafoam that is the same color. 
The doctors, in fact, say I'd be best off in a boat, far away 
from the shore, because pollens, with their fertile sense 
of direction, have no reason to make it very far into the ocean. 
And it's also best I'm kept where I can't fall. 
I'll never be able to have stitches -- my skin 
will form keloids, too sensitive to heal, and bubble 
like the muciferous coughs I'll never outgrow. 
I'm no pushover, though. I fight, for example, the armada 

of dust mites in my room: plastic over my mattress 
and pillows, the humidifiers, vaporizers, and my stuffed animals 
all bundled up in Glad Wrap. Instead of holding hairy pets, 
I watch fish through a tank. My eyelids and theirs, 
on the look out, and thin as soapsuds... I know how and when 
to take my medicine, but this day I forget, 
so excited about the matinee, a Christmas in the open waters 
of space. During the opening credits I'm silent. I don't want 
to miss a minute by asking my mother for some change 
to buy a soda at the stand, so I pull out my pills 
from my jacket pocket and, without a drink, try to swallow them 

with popcorn. My windpipe retaliates and everything 
is stuck in my throat. I choke, then I throw up. 
The vomit sprays on my sweat shirt, a hand-me-down from my cousin. 
Red and white, it reads, peace love peace love... 
in lots of thin rows that wind all around. 
My mother says, "Why don't you take that thing off?" 
when we get home and she sees the crusty orange stains 
on the front. But I only half-hear her, imagining 
the movie plot I've missed, what the air quality might 
be like inside an astronaut's helmet -- 
and if I could run up a hill if I were weightless.
On Shakti Gawain's self help tape 
she endorses the Pink Bubble Technique -- 
placing our worry in an imaginary dome 
and projecting it out into the universe. 
On the brink of my meditations, I've rocketed 
whole countries, entire banking institutions, 
and my nieces, so they'll be protected 
from drunk drivers and AIDS. I've launched 
the Blue Cross/Blue Shield budget, the security 
of my teaching job. A whole building on 23rd Street -- 
poof! My mother's slipped disc, my father's prostate. 
Pieces of everyone I love 
have been cast upward in a pink bubble 
at least once. 
                     As our troubles lift, getting smaller 
and more distant, Shakti Gawain advises: 
"Now, there's nothing left for you to do." 
Because I'd been taught that the wish, the prayer 
is always enough, I was only partially surprised when 
today, before I reached the sulking cashier 
at the end of a long Dagastino supermarket line, I found myself 
in a pastel air ball, suspended high above Manhattan. 
My friend had been concerned because I'd been looking 
down -- afraid, because of the recession, 
that I'd lose my job. She must have been the one 
to cast me into the floating candy-color womb. 
I was still holding a bunch of bananas 
and a TV Guide I was browsing through but never intended 
to buy. In a bubble hovering near mine 
I saw my landlady Leona Helmsley who had ascended herself. 
There were countless other mini-bubbles 
full of stray kittens and brown and pink babies. 
South America was wedged in an oblong sphere. 
A dolphin, an eagle, a chunk of biopsied breast, 
a coiled colon with hopes of being cancer-free -- 
things people worry about most. 
                                                    I was ashamed 
I'd left dishes in the sink. My papers 
were hardly in order. But because the bubble 
was airtight, doorless, I tried to relax 
as I peeled a piece of the fruit I hadn't paid for. 
I checked my TV Guide horoscope 
for the week ending November 25. Woozy, I saw 
my stolen future, through a gauzy pink concave -- the world 
I, with all the others, was drifting away from. The world 
left, for better, for worse, to fend for itself.
My sister picks up her daughters at the bus stop 
ever since a nine-year-old girl from the neighborhood 
was coaxed into a car by a man 
telling her he'd hit a kitten down the road. 
His story went that the small ball of fur 
ran somewhere near the railroad tracks 
and he needed an extra pair of eyes to find it. 
The girl was smart and had been taught 
everything grownups thought she'd have to know 
about even the worst of strangers, but she wanted 
to be a veterinarian when she grew up. 
And the man looked as though he'd been crying. 
"He had that child in the car four hours," 
my mother tells me, my mother who would cut off his balls 
if she had the chance. She sounds fed up, middle-class, 
when she says it, and I want to say "no," 
but I too share her sentiment. My father 
thinks the rapist deserves worse, to be shot dead -- 
no questions asked. My brother-in-law has a gun, 
and my sister knows he'd use it if anyone tried to touch 
their daughters, my nieces, my parents' grandchildren. 
Four hours is longer than some double features, 
longer than some continental plane rides, 
longer than a whole afternoon in grade school. 
Nothing is slower than time when you're nine years old, 
nothing is more fragile than trust. 
The rapist dropped the girl off at the pizza parlor 
where the men who worked there called an ambulance. 
Before this, my nieces walked the short distance home 
and they protest, wanting to know why they can't anymore. 
The after-school rapist hasn't been caught, 
but the second and fifth grade rumors aren't terrifying enough. 
My sister wonders how to tell her daughters, 
who love small animals and only want to help.
Now the papers are saying pesticides will kill us 
rather than preservatives. I pass the school yard 
where the Catholic girls snack. Cheeze Doodles and apples. 
No parent today knows what to pack in a lunch box 
and the plaid little uniforms 
hold each girl in: lines in the weave cross 
like directions, blurry decisions. 
A supervising nun sinks in her wimple. All the things she can't do, 
she thinks, to save them, her face growing smaller. 
She dodges their basketball. 
Who said the Catholic church has you for life 
if it had you when you were five? I remember my prayers at odd times 
and these girls already look afraid. 
But it's not just the church. It's America. 
I fear the children I know will become missing children, 
that I will lose everyone I need to some hideous cancer. 
I fear automobiles, all kinds of relationships. 
I fear that the IRS will find out the deductions I claimed this year 
I made up, that an agent will find a crumpled draft of this poem 
even if fear edits this line out... I have no privacy, 
no protection, yet I am anonymous. I sometimes think 
the sidewalk will swallow me up. So I know when the girls 
line up to go inside and one screams to her friend 
"If you step on a crack, you'll break your mother's back..." 
she means it. She feels all that responsibility, that guilt. 
There's only one brown girl who doesn't do what she should. 
She's dancing by herself to a song on her Walkman. 
One of her red knee socks bunches at her ankle and slips into her sneaker. 
And the shoulder strap of her jumper has unbuckled so her bib flaps. 
Maybe she can save us. I clutch the school yard's chain link fence. 
Please, little girl, grow up to be pope or president.
They tumble from closing bars into here. 
Uninspired men nicknamed for their hair: 
Whitie, Red; the bald one, Flesh. 

What a way to save to go to Europe. 
But that's what I'm doing, 
the donut waitress taking advantage 
of drunks. I look through 
the fatty blurred window, 
remind them often of my aspirations, 
drum on the counter top: I am not like them. 

Red's got a novelty passport 
and motions me over. He thinks 
his finger's alluring as Cape Cod, 
the farthest I bet he's ever gone. 
"Guess where I've been?" 
he slurs and has me open the blue book. 
A rubber jack-in-the-box penis pops out. 

I think of adding sugar to the diabetics' coffee 
when they laugh, describing their naked wives. 
Twenty-four hours, any day, they know here they can. 
There's not even a lock on the Mr. Donut door. 
SO when there's a fight on the corner, Flesh tells me 
to call the police from the phone in back: 
"If the bikers see you finking, they'll get your ass." 

From behind the muffin case, the motorcycle clash 
looks like a home movie: skipping loops, a volume lapse 
as bikes are kicked over, heads smashed. 
The blood puddles slowly, graying. 
Connie strolls in, her lipstick all crazy: 
the fight's over her. She wants a light. 
I know she'll stain the rim of her cup. 

But they all leave big bills under the saucers 
and I get to read the few 
quiet hours before dawn.
Your mother loomed all hips and breasts, 
big mad curves like boomerangs 
always coming back, while you sat in front of your plate 
taking small bites, chewing a bit, 
then spitting the food back out. 
You were in junior high, starting to read -- 
how women were always on a diet: 
refraining from taking late night walks, restricted 
from getting their own credit cards, maybe working construction. 
That was pop-politics, your mother said 
the day she was tired, and the run in her stocking made her cry. 
You would never be her, you commanded your body 
when you noticed your hip jutting from your waist 
and the first bit of fat on your chest -- 
straining towards that mortal hour glass, 
that sandy digestion. Birds eating rocks 
because they don't have knives or forks. 
"She eats like a god damn bird," your father complained, 
always talking about you in the third person. 
"I don't need anyone," you might have said, over and over, 
sometimes aloud, sometimes to yourself until your periods stopped 
and your breasts flattened back to how they were 
when you were a little girl, running in the front yard 
without a shirt. Until you were in the rehab 
and you realized your bones would never be hollow, 
your hospital smock like a spotless bib tied around your neck. 
"This is no bimbo disease," one nurse said absently to another 
as she hooked you to the tube, a robin feeding its baby 
a worm. And when no one was looking, 
you turned your spiny back to winter, the crack of an open window, 
and tried your best to catch pneumonia. A thin 
coat of feathers grew over you, trying to save you.
A kiss has nothing to do with sex, 
she thinks. Not really. That engulfing, that trying to take 
all of another in for nourishment, to become one with her, to become 
part of her cells. The way she must have had everything she wanted 
in the womb, without asking. Without words, 
kisses have barely the slurp-sound of a man entering a woman 
or sliding back out -- neither movement with even the warning of a bark. 
The Greek word "buli," animal hunger. 
Petting, those kisses are called, or sometimes necking. 
She read this advice in a sex manual once: "Take the man's penis, 
slowly at first, like you are licking melting ice cream 
from the rim of a cone." But the gagging, the choke -- 
a hot gulp of tea, a small chicken bone, a wad of gum grown too big. 
That wasn't mentioned. It's about what happens in her mouth 
past her teeth, where there is no more control, like a waterfall -- 
or it being too late when the whole wedding cake is gone: 

She orders one from a different bakery this time, so no one 
will remember her past visits and catch on. She's eating 
slowly at first, tonguing icing from the plastic groom's feet, the hem 
of the bride's gown, and those toothpick-points that kept them 
rooted in pastry. She cuts the top tier into squares, 
reception-like.   (The thrill she knew of a wedding this past June, 
stealing the white dessert into her purse, sucking 
the sugary blue gel from a napkin one piece was wrapped in. 
She was swallowing paper on her lone car ride home, 
through a red light, on her way to another nap 
from which she hoped a prince's kiss would wake her.) 

The second tier in her hands, by fistfuls, desperate 
as the Third World child she saw on tv last week, taking in gruel. 
Her head, light like her stomach is pumped up with air. 
She can't stop. She puckers up to the sticky crumbs under her nails. 
Then there are the engraved Valentine candies; 
CRAZY, DREAM GIRL, ACT NOW, YOU'RE HOT. She rips open the bag, 
devouring as many messages as she can at once. 
They all taste like chalk. She rocks back and forth. 
She has to loosen the string on her sweat pants, part of her trousseau. 
The bag of candy is emptied. The paper doily 
under the cake's third layer, smooth as a vacuumed ice-skating rink. 
What has she done? In the bathroom, like what happened 

to the mistakenly flushed-away bracelet, a gift 
from her first boyfriend -- the gold clasp silently unhooking 
as she wiped herself, then, moments too late, noticing 
her naked wrist under the running water of the rest room 
sink's faucet...She's learned it's best to wait ten minutes 
to make herself throw up. Digestion begins at this point, 
but the food hasn't gotten very far. As ingeneous as the first 
few times she would consciously masturbate, making note of where 
her fingers felt best, she divises a way to vomit 
that only hurts for a second. 

She takes off her sweatshirt and drapes it over a towel rack. 
Then she pokes a Q-Tip on her soft pallet. Keeping in mind 
the diagram in her voice class, the cross section 
of the mouth showing each part's different function, 
the pallet -- hidden and secret as a clitoris. 
The teacher's mentioning of its vulnerability, split-second 
and nonchalant like a doctor and his tongue depressor. 
It's a fast prayer -- she kneels in front of the toilet. 
Her back jerks and arches the way it n-dght 
if she were moving her body to meet a man's during intercourse. 
She wipes what has sprayed back to her chest, 
her throat as raw as a rape that's happened to someone else. 
She cleans the seat of the bowl with a rag, and cleans 
her teeth with a second toothbrush she keeps for this purpose. 
Her sweatshirt back on, she gets to the kitchen 
to crush the cake box into a plastic garbage bag. 
And leaves to dispose of it, not in the trashcan downstairs, 
but in a dumpster way on the other side of town.
The troublemaker has become a monk. 
No longer able to push the puny boys down the stairs, 
torture the wearers of glasses and braces 
or set fire to anyone's locker, 
he says an invocation before our meal. 
It's been ten years 
and none of the cheerleaders are as fat 
as we had hoped, but pretty Suzy is skinnier 
than we could have imagined. 
One of her arms is covered 
by the long sleeve of her sequined gown, 
and the other is bare -- cavewoman-style. 
Suzy's perfect teeth seem to have grown yellow and pointed. 
It is rumored that her track-star-husband beats her. 
The locals say his name has been in the paper, more than once, 
for drugs. I imagine him asking her 
which shoulder will be hidden in her asymmetrical dress, 
where else he can safely punch. The troublemaker monk 
might hear the track-star's confession, 
then say, sadly, he understands. 
Suzy dances like it's not very fun, 
with none of the energy she used 
to scoot to the top of a pyramid of other girls, 
her saddle shoes firmily planted on the backs 
of their maroon and gold uniforms. 
Her legs barely shook and her arms belted out 
as though she were singing an opera. 
When her husband says she doesn't deserve any dessert, 
we feel the guilt of wishing her those extra pounds, 
of wishing Suzy any harm at all
Consider the gall of the bullfrog, 
throatily calling at night for a mate, 
longing for a kiss from a Beauty 
that could change his fate. Some say a frog 
is the male sex. And girls 
who kindly put their lips to its 
are promised to get over their fears. 
But what about the cowfrog? 
No mammary glands, no sweet milk, all her eggs 
outside herself -- not a frog in history 
ever turned into a princess by a peck 
on the cheek from an innocent boy, 
as though female royalty and luck 
sprout from other stuff. Once, before the Ranidae 
were green and slimy, a young she-frog, 
acting on impulse, shyly flirted with a prince. 
She batted her eyes, big and bright as flash bulbs, 
but, busily adjusting his white mink capelet, 
the prince said to someone in his court, 
"Get this commoner out of here! Does she not realize 
such a scandal could cost me my throne?!" 
And like St. Brigid, the defeated she-frog 
might have mumbled, "Please God, 
make me ugly, so I will no longer tempt men. 
So I will no longer be tempted." 
As though for a cowfrog, a would-be princess, 
desire itself is shameful.
I still remember John Nickels poking me 
in the stomach, then putting his arm around my waist, saying, 
"Hey, I like your style." A seventh-grade tingle 
went through me like a potion. 
I just had vague notions of sex and orgasm, my only analogy: 
a pebble ripple in water. 
And, though the flutter lasted long after, I missed him. 
He barely spoke to me again. 
He'd avert his eyes as I came down the hall 
like it was all too much for him to bear -- 
A poke, we both knew, was a promise, a commitment. 
He must have thought he'd turn into a frog or something if he'd admit it.
Walking home through the woods from a movie at the plaza 
that I didn't remember minutes after it ended, 
an action adventure that I didn't want to see, but said yes to 
just in case you held my hand, and you did. 
Walking home by the shortcut, the path 
the developers made because they'd be building houses soon, 
we had nothing to say. It was our first date 
and you stopped to kiss me, the cold of the mud 
wetting my feet. Your tongue, like an animal's 
rough and eager, through the chain link of a zoo's fence. 
I didn't know you, but you put your hands up my shirt 
like it was nothing to either of us. 
You cupped each of my breasts as though holding me back, 
or measuring me for something, then kept walking, 
not taking my hand anymore. Even at fifteen, 
I knew you were the type that after the first kindnesses, 
the honeymoon was over. Your face in the night 
was even flatter, less pronounced than it was in the light. 
I knew, before this, that I didn't love you or even want 
to talk to you the next day in school. 
I told my girlfriends you weren't very smart. You took shop 
and fixed cars with your dad, not even the intricacies 
under the hood, just body work. And when I went to that garage 
in your back yard because we were going to another movie 
and your mother said I should get you 
so we wouldn't be late, I saw calendar pages curling under a picture 
of a topless woman in short-shorts. She was holding a wrench 
to her lips. Your dad looked at me the same way you did, 
but that was how I wanted to be looked at then -- that was how 
I thought it should be. You washed the grease from your hands, 
wiped your brow with your forearm and were ready. A few dates later 
I held your penis as though it were a science experiment 
and put it in my mouth when you asked. A kind of aspic squirted out. 
I swallowed like a brave girl, taking her medicine.
Sex was as beautiful as flowers. 
The orchid unfolding between his legs, 
the baby's breath on his chest, 
the blue bells under his arms. 
Tea roses on your nightgown, 
and, of course, you would have wanted him: 
the only boy at camp 
who didn't vie to tie your underwear to a tree, 
who instead folded it neatly and hid it 
so you'd later find it under your pillow. 
Although he could have, he didn't follow tradition 
and read your letters -- he secured them, 
along with your diary, between your mattress 
and the cot springs. The only boy who gave you privacy. 
So you gave him yourself. At sixteen, 
you'd collected all the pamphlets. You knew 
about the pill, nonoxynol-9 and condoms. 
Still, sex was as delicate as flowers. 
An infection, like the limp cactus 
I watered too much in the glass terrarium 
my first boyfriend gave me. 
Maybe your sex could not take so much love. 
Maybe your sex needed to be diluted 
with sketchier pasts, a stronger fear of AIDS, 
a few more seeds of mistrust. Or maybe, 
more simply, it wasn't your fault. Chlamydia 
is easily treated, the doctor assures you 
although now your mother must know 
and your father, too, with whom you haven't spoken 
in months. I stood holding you once 
when you were just a baby, your diaper 
in the crook of my elbow, and I was counting 
the days, longing to be a teenager. 
I said I had the back of your head 
with my other hand, no problem, 
because I really thought I had -- and, besides,
anyone could take care of a little kid. 
But when I took my hand away from your neck 
just a second, you flipped backwards 
like a blossoming bud a movie camera had captured 
on high-speed film. Your mother caught you 
and held you for the rest of the day. 
The doctor says you are not pregnant, 
the yellow pollens whirling 
outside the girls' tent. The sleeping bags 
stacked and rolled up tight 
like the whorls of petals, rolled up unfairly tight 
and meant only for one.
The longing we know that does not have a name 
may be for our lost twins, our cellular siblings 
who flaked away from us 
only days after our conception. 
Like a singular petal tugged from its floribunda, 
most of us were left alone in our planet-wombs, 
gravity-less balloons, loose space suits. Galaxies of mother 
around us, we slept the way I still like to: 
my back nestled against someone else's chest, 
my knees bent and at rest on his 
as though I were sitting in a chair 
but my weight askew, pulled away to a 90-degree angle. 
No wonder, regardless of who it is, 
love is what I feel every time. 
He is my lost one, my lost twin, 
the dolphin, the underwater uterine-angel 
who loved me regardless, who continued
to swim up against me, whether I pulled away or not. 
I miss him the way a soldier 
has a phantom itch on the elbow 
of his amputated arm. I look into mirrors 
and dress up as someone else. 
Our lost Gods are so hard to find 
though they are as many 
as the flakes of novelty confetti 
that snow from a bridal shower bell. 
Or the pastel dots 
that rise to the roof and multiply 
on this city bus 
as the sun hits a stone 
on some piece of jewelry a passenger is wearing. 
The magic blinks away as we turn the corner 
and a building's shadow takes over. 
We all check our watches 
and bracelets, wondering which one of us 
could have been the source 
of such beauty. The travelers who saw 
look at each other to confirm. 
Our lost Gods, so hard to find -- 
their appearances so short, their bodies so small.
I see so many things, a primitive ring, 
a nest with a fallen-out bottom, 
a white rubber band snapped into blue. 
But mostly it's real memory 
and the doctor holding up my x-ray 
to the screen of light, a mini drive-in. 
The bone was mine -- big, oblong 
and intact, even though my skin was purple, 
my muscles sore. I'd fallen 
off of Matthew's ten speed. 
There were whispers that my hymen was probably gone, 
first broken by the cross bar 
that separates a boy's bike from a girl's, 
rather than by Matthew himself. And now the x-rays 
were showing my ready pelvis, an empty hammock, 
just waiting for a sticky fetus sucking its thumb. 
"It's beautiful," the doctor said 
admiring my illuminated centerfold-skeleton 
before he turned to me, the real -- and therefore 
less interesting -- thing. He smiled: 
"You have the perfect hip bones, miss, 
for carrying babies." To my mother, he said, 
"If everything else inside her is OK, someday 
she'll be in labor for no more than an hour." 
I was thirteen and I wanted no baby, 
only a boyfriend, only some petting. 
I wasn't even sure how I felt 
about tongues. My favorite game was 
swimming deep underwater, kicking through 
a tent of spread legs, scissoring my thighs 
in short quick ups and downs so I wouldn't lose 
by booting someone in the crotch. 
"But I don't want a baby," I might have said aloud. 
The doctor and my mother might have conspiratorially laughed. 
My pelvis was as white as the ones Georgia painted, 
except the weather surrounding hers 
was robin egg-hopeful. 
My bone was a whorl in an x-ray-gray storm. 
My disembodied pelvis, like a melted hoola hoop, 
a coiling snake meeting itself, a lasso 
without the rope of control to catch what I wanted. 
"The women in our family are all Fertile Myrtles," 
my mother explained later, when I changed my mind, and tongues 
and other appendages boys had 
become more to my liking. "When I got 
pregnant with you, I think I was just 
looking at your father," she said as emphatically 
as if she were telling me the truth. So I found out how to get 
a diaphragm and pills and foams and condoms and used them 
all at once, memorizing the percentages 
of their individual effectiveness: 80, 82, 89.5. 
"I'm pregnant, I just know it," 
I would panic every month, my pelvis 
a nebulous halo, a loose fitting noose. 
Exasperated, my first real boyfriend would remind me, 
"Impossible. We didn't even have intercourse last month. 
Remember? You were too nervous." In the meantime, 
my girlfriends, one by one, skipped their periods. 
There were trips for abortions or quick marriages. 
One young mother left high school 
to become a cashier at the Stop & Shop. 
While she was still nursing, she leaked milk 
through her shirt and smock, leaving 
something like a perspiration spot 
every time a baby cried in her line. 
This wasn't for me, though I felt guilty, 
my pelvis being the right shape and all. 
My mother watched her talk shows, sometimes 
on the topic of childless women, and muttered, 
"How can those career ladies be so selfish? 
If they don't have babies now, 
they'll grow old and die alone." 
Sometimes in my dreams I'm back on Matthew's bike, 
not falling this time, but riding off 
into the orange-cowboy sunset. Other times, 
though, a crown of thorns sprouts in my belly -- 
my nightmare grows dark. 
It is always daylight around Georgia's Pelvises. 
The sky is the blue that the child she might have had 
might have seen when she was first born. 
Sometimes I dream bluebirds land on my hipbone 
as though I were a round limb 
on a desert tree. I feed them anything 
they desire. Then the mother birds 
feed their youngsters, and I tell them 
they can stay as long as they like.
Every Saturday the saxophone sage 
plays in front of Chelsea 2nd Hand Guitars. 
Each wordless chorus is his testament, as tragic 
and purple as bruises, as alluring 
as a woman's bare shoulders. 
Every Saturday I listen to the musician's wisdom: 
that he is gold and she is wood, 
that he is one and she is all. He has his reasons 
for playing in front of the guitar store -- 
the actuality and reflections of acoustic hips 
surrounding him like halos of protection 
from the blows of the world. 
He doesn't want to fight. He'd rather slow everything down 
and let us all rest after each tumble. So sure am I 
that his voice will sound exactly like the swimming teacher 
who taught me to dive, I never wait around 
long enough for him to speak. 
Between songs, the saxophone player silently wipes his forehead 
like he's tackled the hardest lessons in a book. 
The silver coins against the red velvet insides of his case 
glint like blushes of afterglow in an unlikely bed. 
Between his songs, the silence 
of the city is so full and tenuous 
that it can't be called silence at all, 
but rather the sound after great sex, 
the sound before a great war.
My first boyfriend is dead of AIDS. The one 
who bought me a terrarium with a cactus 
I watered until it became soft. The one 

who took me to his junior high school prom where I was shy 
about dancing in public. The one who was mistaken 
for a girl by a clerk when he wanted to try on a suit. 

In seventh grade my first boyfriend and I looked a lot alike: 
chubby arms, curly hair, our noses touching 
when we tried our first kiss. My first boyfriend 

was the only one who met my grandmother 
before she died. Though, as a rule, she didn't like boys, 
I think she liked my first boyfriend. 

My first boyfriend and I sat in the back seat 
of my mother's car, and on the ledge behind us 
was a ceramic ballerina with a missing arm. 

We were driving somewhere to have her repaired 
or maybe to buy the right kind of glue. 
My first boyfriend was rich and had horses 

and airplanes he could fly by remote control. 
My first boyfriend died on a mattress 
thrown in the back of a pick-up 

because the ambulance wouldn't come. 
There was a garden in my first boyfriend's yard. 
One day his mother said to us, 

"Pick out some nice things for lunch." 
My first boyfriend and I pulled at the carrot tops, 
but all that came up were little orange balls 

that looked like kumquats without the bumps. 
My first boyfriend and I heard ripping through the soil 
that sounded close to our scalps, like a hair brush 

through tangles. We were the ones who pushed 
the tiny carrots back down, hoping that they were able 
to reconnect to the ground. We were the ones.
Once, late at night my lover and I drove into the desert. 
He was a geologist and, in his pickup, 
he told me not to worry so much about the end of the world: 
humans were too egotistical for their own good. 
If Shakespeare and skyscrapers were lost, 
really -- so what? Around us 
the saguaros were straining against crucifixion. 
I marveled, to myself, the sparkling of the stars. 
The farthest I'd ever gotten away was in orgasm, 
the ones that rolled on and on. 
                         This was the beginning 
of my knowing something about the rest of it -- 
that maybe it wasn't safe to leave, or if I did find a good escape, 
I'd never be able to take everyone with me. 
So as his tongue was lapping me softly, 
like a dog's, like a best friend who loved me, I had to tell him 
it wasn't his fault that I could not come, that I could not go -- 
the desert air wrapped around us just so,
my back against the corrugated bed of his truck -- 
It's just 
that I was thinking of his friend, 
the woman who claimed to see auras and who 
actually witnessed her husband's 
puff into nothingness as he stepped into a malfunctioning elevator 
and dropped to his death. I asked my lover 
if he thought that his friend was making this up. 
His patient hand ran over my collarbone 
and felt for a pulse on my neck. 
Suddenly happy 
to be caught in a life-giving trap, I saw 
around us, a party of one-size-fits-all souls 
carrying on, dancing like there was no territory to speak of, 
dancing like there would definitely be a tomorrow. 
The desert rippled like my boyfriend's truck 
was a mere rock plopped into a vast body of water. 
The shapes multiplied like Jesus's fish, 
like neighbors, like light-oblivion shadows.
I call the police to report the bruises, on my way to work buy a few boxes of cookies, but as soon as I can, believe me, I quit. Bill, again, is climbing the fence, running into the street from what he's become. His skin, which discolors so easily, shows every mark. He's just beginning to sprout patches of moustache and beard, to resent being the oldest kid here, and knowing his mother and father are brother and sister. His eyes stare bland as tap water. 

****

Coco's, Tucson's family restaurant, is giving out kids' paper hats. When I go there for breakfast, I ask for one and keep it in my sock drawer. 

****

Meg and Angela, the other teachers, line up the kids to come in. It's too hot for the after-school group to be crying, though nothing can muddy the playground dust. Some choke as it's spanked off with the big brush. 

****

Bill's mother wears a Circle K smock and his father, a Seven Eleven cap. The only parents who come in together: they see a lust in my smile when I ask if I can take Bill to a matinee on Sunday. If I interfere, his mother says -- she draws on her lips -- she'll kill me. 

****

The nightmares are starting to come back. I try to find a therapist, but the only clinic I can afford has a man and he asks, "How does this make you feel, being five minutes late? Is this a pattern? Are you addicted to drugs? Do you drink? Were you ever abused?" 

****

Angela really cares for the children. One night it's two hours since all the others have gone. Still no one has come for Dana whose mother calls and says everyone is tied up. So Angela keeps Dana overnight at her house and Mary Moppet's finds out. Dana's stepfather always comes now exactly at closing, drunk. He knows he'll be charged a dollar each minute he's late from here on. The daycare, he grumbles, just wants to make a fast buck. 

****

In one of my favorite movies, Atlantic City, Susan Sarandon's character washes herself with lemons after working at an oyster bar. I try to find something like that for me to do. I get tanner and blonder as I sit my free afternoons by the Prince Garden complex pool. 

One day a married man asks me how I am adjusting to Tucson. His wife is pregnant with their first child. I don't know him well. He says we should go for a drink. 

****

Everything at Mary Moppet's is starting to have a form. How big the burn mark determines where Sandy is sent. If it's smaller than my thumb, her parents have to take "how to be a parent" classes. Bigger, she's sent to a foster home and her real mother or father can't sign her out. A record is kept of subsidized suppers: macaroni and cheese, barely drained canned peas. No refills -- there's inventory -- for milk spilled. 

****

There's a naked man, except for underwear tied on his head like a mask. The light bulb I'd left on over my door has burnt out. And past the dirt driveway lined with cactus is the prickly field where I could have been dragged, where I could have been mangled, where he could have done all the terrible things to me he was mumbling. 

The moon above is but a slice of anyone's terror -- Sandy's or Dana's. I crush his hand in the door, keep slamn-ting it with my hip and somehow hook the chain. I'm afraid to turn on the lights so I get a kitchen knife and feel in the dark for the phone. The first time I dial the police, not a sound will come out. And I'm sure I could say even less if more happened. I push the table in front of the door. 

****

Meg is in a rock band and, when she dyes her hair calico, some of the parents complain she's unfit. One Halloween, she brings in face paint and does up the children with it. Mother after father threaten it better come off. 

****

My sister has her second baby, Katie. She calls from Massachusetts and says the labor was easy. I'm glad she didn't have a boy. To me, everything male has begun to look ugly. Even the lie of protection, of kindness: the way the lock thrusts its bolt from the door into the jamb. I constantly check to make sure it's in and hear every noise when I'm in bed or taking a shower. My robe hangs on a hook like a torn bouquet of flowers. 

****

The toddlers stay penned in with their shit. Diapers are changed only every three hours. Spitty blocks are dumped in piles on the floor and Tex is always draining his playmates' bottles. At rest time, we put down mats and pin blankets over the windows to shut out the sun. In the grayish light, small figures slump down. "When nap?" some children even ask as though this is a favorite slot of their days. 

****

It is easier for the teachers to escape. We get passes to go dancing at "Cowboys." We're extras in a made-for-tv movie once: Star Struck produced by Dick Clark. We sit at a set bar and watch a soap opera actress's all-girl band, nudge each other on the shoulders or elbows, point, and look like we're having fun. 

****

The police send helicopters out the night that guy tried to attack me, but never find him. I hunt like a detective for men with bandages on their right hands long after his would have healed, long after I move away from Tucson. The cop that comes to take the report at the complex says, if this ever happens to you again, you should never run home; now he knows where you live; instead, run to the street where there's traffic, some stores; surely, someone will help you. 

****

Meg leaves Mary Moppet's when she gets enough gigs. Angela goes to Mexico. She's getting married, wants kids of her own.
My mother drags her money across the street 
from Old Colony to Fleet National Bank 
because she reads Old Colony has been having trouble 
collecting property loans. What if the bank had closed? 
What if there were big day-glo letters 
slapped over the hours telling her so? 

What would my mother have had to do to get her money? 
It says on the door deposits 
are federally insured up to an amount 
she has a lot less of. But how long 
would the reimbursement have taken? How many forms? 
She knows the government. She was born 

at the tail end of the Depression, her childhood 
was the Second World War. She knows 
from raising her own family 
about meat-stretchers, how to sew. She knows 
about wanting, about lies, although with babies in diapers 
and working full time, she can barely recall 

Vietnam. She's saved all these years, but now 
she can't get on the plane to Florida. 
She doesn't want me to go on vacation to California 
because of the quakes. She doesn't want me 
to ride the subways, or, for that matter, live in New York 
at all. She'd find me a job in a small place 

with a small husband. 
The way she lives is a little safer 
though there are murders, too, in our hometown, 
and last year some teenagers broke in 
in the middle of the afternoon, 
when she was home. In her dream, my father dies 

and on one will help her cut the lawn. 
I am gone, as is my sister. 
When she asks the children 
on the street, says she'll pay them, 
they just laugh at her. She looks in the phone book 
under hired help, 

but in typical dream-fashion, 
the letters and numbers all blur. 
When my mother attempts to call the operator, 
the touch-tone buttons melt 
under the heat of her index finger. 
From one window, she sees the grass has grown 

as high as the trees 
and from another, there is a drift of snow 
blocking her entire view. 
As though her dream is real, 
I tell my mother: Do not worry. 
If it comes to that, I will mow the yard, I will shovel, 

but she is silent, knows this is false comfort. 
I'm too far. But the phones will always work, 
I assure her, I am only a train ride away. 
My own dreams are full of AIDS -- 
My friends topple, slowly, in pain. 
And my mother and father, in the ones 

where they're still alive, 
go to banks where their cards have been revoked, 
their PIN numbers have been brainwashed 
out of their heads. I can't help 
because there are no more trains, 
mail carriers, planes, Western Union. 

"It is the end of the world as we know it," 
a singer is singing the same song, 
except all the lyrics are different, unrecognizable 
to me because there is no more English. 
Locks and owning anything is forbidden. 
"My narents have been through enough!" 

I am screaming. The streets are cobblestone 
and dark. Soldiers are hiding in dumpsters, 
between slats of scaffolding surrounding construction. 
When I wake the first time, I am sitting 
in a rocking chair. My mother's head rests 
on my right knee, my father's on my left.
David didn't come to school Tuesday, 
the day his essay was due. 
Instead the police showed up -- 
a Dragnet team -- asking if anyone 
had seen him since Friday. 
The class huddled at the implications 
of the words: missing person. 
David, eighteen, too old for milk cartons, 
but just ripe for the morgue 
and a numbered tag around his bare toe. 
Just ripe for a knife, a bullet, 
a bat. He was gentle, small enough to be raped 
then stored in a car trunk 
if there was time, or left on a subway platform 
with his empty wallet by his head. 
When I called his mother the next day 
the phone didn't ring a full ring before she picked it up. 
Not having slept, she couldn't remember her address 
when I said David's English class 
wanted to send her a card. 
She said David was the first of his family 
to go to college. I told her he wrote 
beautiful essays, then I said, "I mean, he writes
beautiful essays," trying to keep him alive 
by using present tense. When he showed up 
to class on Thursday, we all thought we were seeing 
his ghost. Blue bruises tinted his black forehead, 
like a halo collapsing inward. 
He said he'd been arrested in East New York, 
and we all clapped because he was still alive. 
He told the story -- stopped as a passenger 
in a stolen car, which, of course, turned out 
not to be stolen after all. 
"Run, so I can shoot you, nigger," 
a police man said to David 
who shook and whirled inside 
like a blender. He had to concentrate 
on his feet, keeping them steady 
so there'd be no mistake about any sudden movements. 
He was tossed in a cell, questioned 
about the two hundred dollars in his front pocket 
since he was on his way to buy his girlfriend 
a ring for her birthday. The white cops 
made fun of his musk oil, stepped on his sunglasses 
though, he was assured later, this was by mistake. 
Though everyone in America is still entitled 
to that cliched one call, this particular jail 
in East New York didn't have a pay phone 
that worked. David cried into his cot, 
and the guard called him a mama's boy, 
hitting him, heel of his palm to David's head. 
No phone, they laughed the first 48 hours, 
and the tri-state Dragnet team took two more days 
after that to find him, even though 
he was in one of their own jails. 
David told us his story Thursday morning, 
and to cut the tension I said he could have an extension 
on his paper. He said not to worry, 
he had a good lawyer from Jacoby and Meyers. 
Those of the class who knew better groaned. 
"You need a great lawyer," I said. 
"An expert in civil suits -- you could sue the city. 
Just think of the psychological damages 
to your family alone." Then someone in the back row 
held up The Post, the front page declaring 
the jury had acquitted 
the policemen who'd beaten Rodney King. 
We all knew what we had seen -- 
yet today's paper seemed less real, 
more frightening than the video tape. 
I wrote the words irony and metaphor 
in big block letters on the chalk board. 
David stood up and bowed, 
the best of definitions we could come up with.
The cashier who usually winks at me was watching the hanging tv over my shoulder -- Kojak or something like that. And a cat sat on the counter. A little boy was asking for cigarettes for his mother when I heard a gun shot, a little loud, I thought, for a tv. Then, no, it can't be. On Avenue B the first bullet missed, but as I turned to the window the second one got him and a man went soaring and flopped onto the sidewalk as though it were his bed and he'd had a long day. The little boy was looking, too, out through the door where his head only reached Pull spelled backwards. He started screaming when the cashier said, "Hey, I know that guy," and I had to stop the little boy from running out to the street where a mob was forming. The assailant ran and took a right onto the block where I live, and others began running, too. 

It was only five in the afternoon -- a mother would send a boy to the store. We heard more distant shooting, then the squealing ambulance, cop cars in the rain. The police moved a little tired, a little afraid. One came into the Deli asking, what did he look like? Spanish, male, a jean coat, I ventured 5'8", but added that I'm really a bad judge of height. The cashier said nothing about this guy looking familiar and the little boy just wanted to go home. The policeman said, "Little man, why don't you give us a few minutes to find the bad guy before you come on outside." So I bought this boy a bag of popcorn, lifted him up onto the counter where he sat and stroked the cat. We both watched through the glass, and he said he felt OK now, that it was kind of like watching tv.
He hopes I'm not squeamish about scars. 
His long-sleeved arm, where he's been shot 
by two bullets. Two hints 
of what lies beyond his cuff: scars 
on the flip side of his palm 
like grooves on a record album, the thick grooves 
that separate songs. I assure him 
I'm not easily shocked -- why, when I was ten 
I was bitten by a dog. See, the pink slug 
below my shoulder that never healed quite right. 

When he takes off his shirt, the graphs 
on both of his arms are like two big kissing fish -- 
fish almost the size of each of my hands, 
the fins fanning away, outlined 
by big cross stitches, the symbol 
for kisses closing a letter. 
The fish scales, unevenly dimpled, 
like scraps of persistent wallpaper 
during a renovation. Still, he says, 
the doctors did a good job. 

When I touch the fish, he says they don't hurt. 
And there's something of a coin slot 
on his stomach where the second bullet, 
having gone through his arm, grazed. 
And then on his leg, a lighter patch 
as though someone has clouded him with a chalk eraser. 
This skin was taken from here, 
he explains, for his arm. And, on his back, 
another impression, where he was stabbed, 
but that happened when he was a kid. 

He once beat up someone who teased him, 
then took all his money. He's rigged candy machines 
to drain out the change. And long ago, 
he tied up someone who took his stereo. 
I want to know if he's ever stolen a car. 
He hasn't, and those mini-crimes 
only really happened, he says, 
at the first of his adolescence, 
marveling at his new bigness -- no longer 
the little Black Jerry Lewis

without rights to even his own bike 
once the boy next door got a hold of it. 
But yesterday, when in a dispute 
for a New York City parking space, 
he stepped out of his car, 
and the leery contender drove off. 
This isn't the kind of thing I usually admire -- 
the people who push their weight around 
are hardly ever the people I know. Yet, for a moment, 
I felt the thrill, vicariously the bully. 

But what of the safety implications for me? 
Blond, a woman vs. black, a man. 
Then, before I get more scared for one of us 
than the other, I remember his story of the line-up, 
to identify the smirking guy who shot him, 
the frustration of a dividing two-way mirror. 
The months of physical therapy for him 
to be able to produce a legible signature, 
just because of his hesitation to give up his wallet, 
in the dark, on 11Oth Street, in August.
for Phil
That's the way it started. 
Split-second brown-outs in his kitchen 
as his mother made him his favorite sandwich, 
then later a flicker 
in a neighbor's lamp. He was like Harold 
and his Purple Crayon, 
but backwards -- 
things blackening into nothing 
when he thought about them. 
When his friends said that this darkness 
never came to them, the boy who dimmed light bulbs 
realized he was different. He told himself 
maybe he'd outgrow it in his adolescence, 
but didn't. A night beyond his curfew 
he walked the long way home in Smithtown, 
each suburban street light 
blinking off as he passed. 
All becoming part of the background night. 
No stars, the length of Long Island 
a velvet gloved finger, 
what his shadow would have been like 
if he had stopped to pause 
and the watts had stayed on. 
His teachers said he had no other choice 
but to become an artist, 
so he moved away from home 
to Manhattan. He sublet an apartment 
on the Lower East Side 
and the radiators started to spit 
and crackle like the teeny dots 
of gunpowder sold to kids on red paper strips. 
A girl on the steps to his building 
played with them all day, her mission 
to get at something, to free 
the small sulfur ghosts.
More than envious, sometimes the man, 
who as a boy dimmed light bulbs 
and didn't know many girls, 
paused and watched her 
as she let off her steam. 
Next, fuses started to blow, 
and a fire began when he tried to iron 
a shirt for his waitering job. 
The City of New York made the landlord 
of the building he lived in 
rewire the property, 
and the boy who grew into a man 
without outgrowing his tendency 
to dim light bulbs 
muttered under his breath 
that it wasn't his fault. He hadn't painted 
anything yet, though he still 
told everyone who asked that he was an artist. 
His tv split in the middle 
like it had been hit by lightning, 
and he was only looking 
at the TV Guide. He went to four churches 
and the offering candles 
were instantly snuffed. He went to a nutritionist
who said he should stay away 
from high-energy foods 
and slowly sip drinks whipped in a blender. 
Then he went to a shrink 
who asked about his mother. 
The man who had dimmed light bulbs, 
not only as a boy, said maybe, 
now as he thought about it, 
he did have one resentment. 
He told about those liver sandwiches 
he only said were his favorites 
to make his mother happy, 
but that really made him sick. 
The shrink said not to separate 
the boy who dimmed lightbulbs 
from the man who dimmed them still 
as he reached in his pocket 
for a cigarette. The shrink 
asked the boy/man if he minded 
if he smoked, but didn't wait 
long enough for an answer 
before rubbing the tiny wheel 
of his Bic lighter. Shards 
of light bulb fell like slices of snow. 
And both hot and cold, 
the Fifth Avenue office 
went up in flames, then the hall, 
the elevator, the whole floor. 
The boy who dimmed light bulbs 
cleared his throat.
My father slides into third base 
and falls on the sandy pavement of the street 
where we play kick-ball. The varicose veins 
in his legs leap like frogs who can't get out, 
and his knee is skinned like a kid's. 
"I'm fine, I'm fine," he says, heading into the house. 
"You finish out the game. That's an order." 
The neighborhood kids adjust, call someone else 
up to kick, and put back the cardboard base 
my father's spill has misplaced. 
But my concentration is lost. Is my father 
washing his wound thoroughly enough? 
I bet he doesn't know where the Band-Aids are. 

My father continues to fall, in replay fashion, 
as I watch him a few days later in his hospital bed. 
The fluid in his inner ear, waving 
and whacking him out of balance. He says 
it was like he'd just hopped off of a spinning whirligig 
when, at work, he went to wipe his hands on his apron 
and the bakery ovens were suddenly on the ceiling. 
When he collapsed, he thought he was bracing himself 
against the wall. A spinning screen, a time-lapse in a movie. 
When he was on the ambulance stretcher, he says, 
he was better, clutching on to the side's metal bar. 
But it was, for him, the ledge of a building's roof 
because his left and right had become up and down. 

On our next visit, my mother tells us in the hospital elevator 
not to cry or stare at the tubes and graphs 
on the monitors. My father claims this time 
he's feeling quite well -- we didn't even have to come. 
He has the chilling confidence of my sister who will, 
in a few years, wake up from a coma, 
after her car accident, and answer, when asked, 
that her name is Michele and she's seven: 
"Now, where's the peanut butter ice cream?" 
Over the next couple of days, she'll age herself back 
to eighteen. And my father, too, will soon loosen his grip 
on the empty food tray suspended above his counterpane. 
For now, it's the safety bar on his roller coaster car. 

And each time his family visits, his wife and daughters 
inch their way down the wall, eventually 
crossing the corner of the L and standing on the floor. 
His disease is rare, the specialists say. 
So when my father sleeps after his medicine, 
I study one of his ears for something out of place. 
The C of his helix is perfect, the antihelix 
tucked neatly beneath, and the concha 
winding down smaller into that dark canal 
where his trouble lies so deep, even the light 
of a doctor's speculum can't reach it. Maybe there's something 
like an air bubble, adrift as it might be 
in a carpenter's level when his line is slightly crooked. 

I ask my mother to explain to me again why ears pop 
during a hilly car ride, why sometimes my ears ring when I sneeze. 
Can he drive? Can he read? Can it happen again? 
That top setting itself into twirling...Not much difference now, 
for my father, between the sky and the lake. He walks with a cane, 
aiming for what he thinks is his destination, 
training himself to then go twenty degrees to the left. 
In this world of gravity and one-way streets, my father wanders, 
refusing any help. And as though his topsy-turviness 
is passed on in my genes, I stand, in a window -- 
more like a mother than a daughter -- trying to let go: 
my father shovels the driveway, his hands 
without gloves and a lit cigar in his mouth.
It's closing, Grand Central Station. And I think I see my Uncle Wil, only one month dead, sitting with the homeless, eating a sandwich out of a brown paper bag, and wearing the coat he entrusted me with last Christmas. He asked that I deliver it to the vagrant who lived on my block. I think, though, the guy sold my uncle's Hagar for liquor because within a week it was gone. 

Grand Central is bigger than usual, as big, in fact, as a Midwestern field. An angel- nurse pulls a train of empty ambulance stretchers like a child pulls a chain of wagons looking to give rides to her friends, or like circus elephants link by tails and trunks. Some of the homeless follow her, wanting to get on and lie down. 

As I get closer, this isn't my uncle after all, beyond the information booth, the big clock. The man whose back leans against the blue hazy light of Chemical Bank is someone else. He is screaming, although his words are faint by the time they reach me: "We are all homeless on Earth. This is not where we should be...." 

Outstretched hands like llamas' heads pushing through zoo bars, and voices chanting, "Quarter, quarter, please spare a quarter..." The saxophone, so romantic in New York, turns to a harp that I suspect I am hearing from the roof of heaven, and I swoon to the floor like I did on Fourteenth Street in Our Lady of Guadalupe Church. It was the AIDS mass, and a priest touched my forhead--though I kept saying, 'No-no-no-I won't fall," I eased back onto the floor, was lowered into a grave which became a womb, and came back within seconds to sn-dling faces telling me I'd been very receptive. 

This time when I awake crumpled Zaro's bags and cigarette butts, littered around my face and arms, slowly disappear. And above the glorious Grand Central ceiling, all quarks and quasars and gods with arrows. Without moving, I'm all energy like I'm idling in a car with its hood down or being strapped into a rocket. Then I'm off, pushed and pulled headfirst like a birth, past the windows, the ceiling, toward the light where my uncle is waiting -- where nothing looks particularly familiar yet is, like the hospital I can't remember, but in which I was born.
We must have clamored for the same mother, hurried for the same womb. 
I know it now as I read that my birthday is his. 
Since the first time I saw his picture, I sensed something -- 
and with a fierce bonding and animosity 
began following his career. 

Look where I am and look where he is! 
There is a book documenting his every haircut 
while all my image building attempts go unnoticed, even by my friends. 
I'm too wimpy to just dye my curls red 
or get them straightened. I, sickening and moral, 

talked about chemicals when I should have been 
hanging out with George's pal, Marilyn. 
He would have set me right:
Stop your whining and put on this feather tuxedo. Look, 
do you want to be famous or not? 

In the latest articles, Boy George is claiming he's not 
really happy. Hmm, I think, just like me. 
When he comes to New York and stays at hotels in Gramercy Park 
maybe he feels a pull to the Lower East Side, 
wanders towards places where I am, but not knowing me, doesn't know why. 

One interviewer asks if he wishes he were a woman. 
Aha! I read on with passion: and a poet? Boy, I bet you'd like that -- 
You wouldn't have to sing anymore, do those tiring tours. 
George, we could switch. You could come live at my place, 
have some privacy, regain your sense of self. 

So I begin my letter. Dear Boy George, 
Do you ever sit and wonder what's gone wrong? 
If there's been some initial mistake? 
Well, don't be alarmed. There has been, 
but I can set it straight.
Today, you say, as though an actor 
in some bad coming attraction, 
that you did not leave me for a man, but for all men, 
and I grab a loose hand, Max's leather mitten, 
shake it something like: nice to have met you. 
He is all outside, your new boyfriend. 
His cheekbones as perfect as a summer playground, he's steel 
rings and slides. My face is lost in a muddy flush. 
You've made me hate that I am intricate, all insides, 
a pink watery cave, an occasional gluey pearl. 

We were just driving age when I picked you up 
for a matinee. Both sticky and cool, you showed 
me your unmade bed that summer afternoon 
and winked. Your mother on an errand, 
you closed the door and opened your clothes, 
the green plaid shirt from your newly showered skin. 
You helped me with my belt. 
We arched our waists in some strange ballet. 
Harder than we thought, it was hot and cold 
and slippery all at once. Calf-straining, like ice-skating. 

We heard a slam as you entered. I jerked 
my feet into my jeans, pulled them up 
past my knees, before I spotted my underwear 
wound, a figure eight, on the floor. I coiled the cotton 
into a ball, a twisted lump in my back pocket. Stay here, your palms 
told my shoulders, weighting me down with Winning The Oscar: 
Pictorial Glances in my lap. My lips pouty as stars 
and all swollen red. Your mother yelled: 
I want her out of here! I was just -- your voice as though prying 
two stuck pages apart -- showing her my book. 

I can name every movie we saw for the next five years 
but that one on that day. You quiet, except for: 
I can't believe you let me do that...Maybe my mother is right.
You broke our pact the way we broke each other: 
driving faster, I swerved a cry. You shrugged: 
Don't be sentimental...Besides, men are different. 
Were you looking, even then, for your own shoulder? So many 
shirtless boys on the street. I'd be alone 
and in the cinema restroom with my first-time blood -- 
it streaked my hand, admittance, the color of my ticket stub.
My friend has cervical cancer 
that grew from a wart virus she contracted 
from an ex-lover. There was infidelity 
and lying, the worst relationship she's ever had. 
And now surgery. Possible sterility. 
Her cells keep growing like they don't know any better, 
and her gynecologist is calling back all the wart virus patients 
she's ever treated to test them again, 
this time for the kind 
of cancer my friend has -- a rare, dangerous strain. 
We agreed earlier today -- it's like science fiction. 
I am tired, alive on the subway, 
and Ryan White's on the cover 
of the People magazine I just bought. 
It is dated in advance -- April 23rd -- 
like the eagerness of a virus itself. 
Today, one of my students mentioned, in passing, 
asbestos takes 24 hours to leak 
from a ceiling onto a floor and fully contaminate the air. 
And it seems too soon to put Ryan White in a poem, 
concurrent with all the newspapers and tabloids. 
On a television talk show, one child in a studio audience 
asked Ryan if it was fun to meet celebrities like Elton John 
and Michael Jackson. Adult America realized the question, 
once it had been posed, was exactly the one we'd all been wanting 
to ask. The AIDS-infected boy answered gracefully, 
with an understanding laugh. How easy it is to love 
blond Ryan White, his white straight teeth, 
the white down on his delicate teenage neck, 
the kind of boy I know I'd have had a crush on in high school. 
There is a homeless man right in front of me 
begging for chemotherapy money. I've seen him before 
on the One Line. He blames Agent Orange 
for the knob on his stomach. He pulls up his tee shirt 
to show us -- those who will look -- 
and I fixate on his glob of cancer rather than meet his stare.
He says he'll get off with any of us at any stop, 
sleep on any one of our floors. 
He'll eat anything we don't want in our refrigerators. 
His story includes his two teenage daughters, 
something about the pipelines in Alaska. 
He is furious, like all of us, at the government. 
A fist rises up in his otherwise empty stomach. 
He has not learned the art of forgiveness, 
as Ryan White had, only because he hasn't 
as yet found a sympathetic ear. 
Two days from now my friend will have a part of her cervix removed. 
Two days ago I sent off what I owed to the IRS, 
writing "No bombs. We need AIDS research!" on the memo line 
in the bottom left hand corner 
of my check, but debating first for some time. 
I didn't want to draw any attention to myself. 
I didn't want to be audited. So I turn 
from the Agent Orange man 
and from People's Ryan White story 
to the Poetry Flash magazine I am carrying. 
I see Robert Hass' "A Story About the Body," 
a poem I'd heard him recite at a reading last year, 
the one about the composer who's attracted to a painter, 
but who cannot make love to her 
because she has had a double mastectomy. 
She cannot say her anger, but instead leaves for him 
a bowl of dead bees. 
I burst into tears seemingly not related to me 
as though my eyes were breasts 
I could lose at any time. My eyelids, supple 
as the condom I never thought would break. 
                                                                   "It's nothing, 
really -- it's been coming on for a while," 
I tell the woman sitting next to me 
who offers a Kleenex, probably because I am almost as white 
as Ryan White is white 
and well-dressed, just coming from work. 
When I first heard Robert Hass read 
"A Story About the Body," I thought the man in the poem 
was an unfeeling asshole. But today 
I want to give that composer a hug, 
then lead him to the gorgeousness of the artist's breastless chest. 
I conjure her face, the pallets of her ribs. 
I tell them they could have a meaningful relationship. 
Because they seem like nice people, I explain to them 
what I've learned from my self help books: 
If they don't work out their problems with each other now, 
they'll just have to work them out 
down the line with someone else. 
The Agent Orange man tries another car 
and I am left with these tears, these embarrassing tears 
that taste embarrassingly like sex. 
That taste: don't just sit there, do something. 
That taste like beautiful pollution.
As a child visiting Hampton Beach, 
I was one day so chilled by the ocean 
that when I went to the bath house to pee, 
the warm, by comparison, temperature of my urine 
burned me. I swore I saw a chimney line of smoke 
rise between my legs from the toilet. My mother 
didn't know enough about chemistry to explain it. 
Instead, she insisted on her rules. 
This is the first thing I think of as an adult 
learning that there is a river in Yugoslavia 
so polluted it cannot even be used 
to cool down machinery. As a child taught 
to bless the lakes and brooks and tide pools, 
I didn't cheat until adolescence -- 
relieving myself in Social Pond, my water 
a hot pocket I swam away from fast. 
This local spot was a place for floating ghostly 
arm and leg casts, cigarette butts, an occasional diaper. 
Any one of these could have given me 
my first eye infection, and my mother barred me 
from our local pond completely. I went to my room 
where I thought about the fact that somewhere a fish 
choked on the Band-Aid loosened from the blister on my heel. 
Litterbug was the in word then. Neither my mother nor I 
could have defined carcinogenic or toxin. 
The world went on with us, damning its own baptism 
and cultivating tempting orchards 
of mutant delicious ultraviolet apples.
The time I was ten and walking 
to my friend Donna's house, 
and the German shepherd came out of nowhere. 
His paws on my shoulders 
as though he was bracing me for something, 
about to teach me a lesson 
or new dance. He was like the four foot tall 
rag doll with stirrups on her hands 
and feet that Uncle Ray and Aunt Shirley 
had given me for Christmas. I'd strapped her on 
to learn how to waltz. I could lead her 
or dip her, flop her cotton head 
on my shoulder, but this German shepherd 
was all will and might and silvery gray gums. 
The sky above, a sky of gray sweatshirts 
of lifting barbells or running around tracks. 
The dog leaned into me and I was on the ground. 
He bit in four places, my two shoulders, 
my right hip, my left arm, 
until a man with a hard hat as orange 
as any construction, as orange as a pumpkin, 
came out and whacked the dog on its back. 
"You're trespassing," he said, 
no kinder to me. "You're supposed to go 
by the street." Behind him the sky 
loomed like a trainer, the meanest gym teacher. 
The man yanked me up by one arm, 
and I started to run to Donna's 
knowing from another little girl's scary story, 
men can be even fiercer than dogs. 
"You OK, kid?" he called after me, 
like a bad friend who all of a sudden 
wants to make up, if only because he's afraid 
you'll tell his mom. I ran 
all the way, as though I was on fire 
and didn't know enough to roll in the dirt.
Donna screamed when she opened the door 
to her house, the back of my tee shirt 
all covered with blood, all of it. 
Her mother wasn't home. And so I'd believe her, 
she made me look in the bathroom mirror. 
I called my house and left 
red finger prints on her phone. 
Not until then, did specific places 
on my body start to hurt. 
The pinking sheared notches 
on my shoulders, the ripped open bum 
in my hip. Donna wrapped a facecloth 
around my elbow, near the only wound 
that was exposed. Blood had dripped down 
my leg, around my sneaker, 
and underneath, into the grips on the soles, 
so that each of my footprints also 
left little squiggles of blood 
on the tiles of her bathroom and kitchen floors. 
"I was trespassing," 
I confessed as soon as my mother 
pulled up in the yellow Impala 
and finally I was able to cry. 
She said, "Here, lie down," 
and from the window 
of the back seat, the sky 
a big gray brick, as hard 
as the sky ever gets with no storm 
in sight. I asked how much 
blood I could lose, and my mother 
said, "Don't worry, honey, it looks worse 
than it really is," and I pictured 
the seven pints everyone had, 
but outside of us all, and filling 
the nickel waxy milk cartons 
the lunch ladies sold at school. 
I comforted myself -- how juice in a glass 
always looks like so much more 
after it's been spilled.
In the emergency room, 
the doctor peeled my shirt 
from me like a wet bathing suit, 
told jokes about firemen and rabbits. 
My mother was there, too, 
a strong silent angel. And no one 
said anything like I was wrong 
to be on the path we kids cleared 
through the woods, that ran 
from my street to Donna's, 
long before all the new development 
had started. There was a path, too, 
behind Madeline Avenue 
that went clear through 
to East Woonsocket School. 
Safer for their children 
to walk there, parents thought, 
than on the big busy streets 
that didn't have sidewalks. 
Now, having the time to react, 
my body said what it could 
to the German shepherd. 
From the crook inside my elbow 
emerged a purplish blue ghost, 
like the hickey bruise 
on Donna's older sister's neck, 
soft and full of status, 
hurting less she said 
than getting pierced ears. 
She showed us how it changed 
to a yellowish green 
when, a few weeks later, 
she scrunched down the ribbed collar 
of her turtleneck 
and told us once again, 
"Remember -- this is our secret." 
I had to have a tetanus shot 
so I wouldn't go crazy 
and foam at the mouth, or twirl
the way I'd seen a boy at school 
imitate his dog who'd died from rabies. 
Breaking all the fourth grade rules 
about opposite sex friends, 
this boy sent me a book to read 
while I was recovering. 
My scars were pink shiny maggots, 
even that boy admired, that said 
I could survive anything, 
that said I could go 
wherever I wanted.
In 1981 I was on a train in Milan 
where a man would later try to molest me, 
where later I'd push him so hard 
he'd call me a bitch, though he said nothing else 
in English, and he'd rip the collar 
of my shirt, and I'd kick him and run 
only to be trapped on the platform 
where I could see him masturbating 
through the window of the train he stayed on. 
His friends would block the entrance 
to the terminal where I wanted to get help. 
His friends would call me "bonita," surround me, 
and touch my neck and hair before the police 
would come and do nothing because, they said, 
it wasn't a violation, really. I was all right. 

In 1981 I was on a train in Milan 
trying to write my sister a letter 
because she is a year younger than I am 
and because she was living at home with my parents 
and she was pregnant. I thought, then I wrote, 
"You could get an abortion." But she was eighteen, 
and she was in love with her boyfriend. 
She wanted to get married and have a husband. 
So I scratched out the abortion sentence 
while a man sitting next to me was reading the letter 
that panged on my lap. I was crying when he whispered 
he was able to read English and smiled as though his hand 
was already on my knee. He was like the man 
who would, in a few hours, try to rape me. He asked 
if it was true, if American girls were easy.
First, I'm assuming that gravity is working. 
That you're, at this moment, being pulled 
towards the earth. That your head is bigger 
than your hand. That you know what a computer is. 
That your arms are shorter than your legs. 
That you get around. I assume 
that the land and water masses on the globe 
are proportional representations of the land and water 
masses on earth. I assume the stars 
are where the astronomers tell us they are, 
that such scientists have no reason to lie, 
that there's life on other planets, and the infinity sign 
is symbolized by that little figure eight 
lying on its side. I assume you know how to count and add, 
that you've never gotten to the biggest number. 
That your telephone is currently in service. 
That you have a phone and a pad to take messages. 
That you know your number by heart. 
That you have a few good friends to talk to. 
That they know your phone number and call you often. 
That you think killing someone violently, 
for no good reason, is wrong. That you get hungry. 
That you eat vegetables sometimes. 
That you buy produce in stores, that you wash 
the leaves of lettuce first. That you are troubled, 
at least a little, about our environment. 
That you have a sexual orientation. 
That you can draw a fish or flower. 
That you've never meant 
to deliberately hurt anyone. That you define yourself 
as boy or girl, man or woman. That you are a product 
of your upbringing. That you're more than 
the sum of your parts. That you 
have been stereotyped at some point. 
That you have a legitimate gripe 
That you know more than you let on. 
That you can't always express what you feel. 
That a diamond costs more than a rhinestone. 
That, no matter how rich or poor, you have a price range. 
That you usually get the right change. 
That you have used a stove. 
That you think some behaviors are more acceptable 
than others. That you live by a code of ethics. 
That when you break your own code, you feel bad. 
That you think you're different. 
That you are indeed different. 
That paint brushes are made in an assortment of sizes. 
That you were once smaller than you are now. 
That you are alive. 
That you have celebrated holidays. 
That you have the same birthday as someone else. 
That you think about sex. 
That you have a mother. 
That your father is either dead or alive. 
That you have met your parents or not. 
That there are technicalities. 
That you fantasize about the lives of strangers. 
That you didn't always have those shoes. 
That when your baby teeth were growing in you screamed. 
That you aren't always paying attention. 
That there are certain things you can't remember. 
That you can imagine petting a small animal. 
That you have thought about what love means. 
That sometimes your tongue gets dry. 
That you've felt inadequate. 
That you are sometimes hot, sometimes cold. 
That you've reached out for help. 
That you can do two things at once. 
That your blood is red and you can wink. 
That you are using Marilyn Monroe 
as a reference point for beauty. 
That you have an ego. 
That you worry. That you go to the bathroom. 
That there's a toilet where you live. 
That you live under a roof. 
That you are sometimes ultra-aware one day you will die. 
That you have seen children. 
That you have seen a coat and skirt made of ultra-suede. 
That you know the difference between a spoon and a fork. 
That you sometimes are at a loss for words. 
That you have an opinion. 
That you know how to read or that someone 
will read this to you aloud. Assuming 
I could be wrong, I'm also assuming 
that you understand English. 
That you weren't able to read this before it was written. 
That you are partially made up of bones and plasma. 
That someone else hasn't already written these letters 
in the same exact order with the same exact spaces 
in between. That your body has been immersed in water. 
That you see the same color and shape as I do 
when we look at the same peach. That there is a theater 
near you. That a movie will be released 
at Christmas. That you have been to visit a dentist. 
That if someone says "profit" or "prophet" 
in a conversation you know from the context 
if he or she means "accumulation" or "wise one." 
That you have seen the inside of a church. 
That you've bought someone a present. That you think 
I'll leave something out. That you can grow hair, 
that you sometimes clean your fingernails, 
that your fingernails have gotten harder 
as you've grown older, assuming you've grown older, 
and that, when you were a baby, a caretaker 
peeled your soft cartilage away so that you wouldn't 
accidently scratch yourself. That both your fingernails 
and hair will grow on after you die, 
that you will indeed pass away, 
that you will be buried or cremated, 
that your body will be found, 
that someone will cry when you die, 
that you've cried when someone you've loved has died, 
that you have loved someone -- 
either sexually or as family 
and that those two lines didn't cross, 
or they did. That you want to talk about it. 
That you fret if people say they don't like you. 
That you've been to a party. 
That you like some kind of music. 
That you have felt jealous. 
That the world is round 
because Columbus said so. That you have been to 
or seen pictures of America. 
That you have been exposed to ritual. 
That you have rejected certain traditions. 
That you like some people more than others. 
That you have been angry. 
That you have been oppressed. 
That if a stranger saw your naked body 
you'd feel something like shame or surprise. 
That you know what a gun can do. 
That you have watched tv in color or black and white. 
That you identify your skin with a shade 
that doesn't accurately specify 
the richness of its tones. 
That you have put check marks in boxes. 
That you've observed someone with chapped lips. 
That you have suffered. 
That you have relatives and a background. 
That you have said something you didn't mean. 
That you have a preference. 
That you're only human. 
That you have made a mistake when writing 
and had to cross whole words out. I assume 
that the operator will help you 
place your call. That the post office 
will be opened as scheduled this week. 
That you have a goal. That there's a want 
in your belly and a heart in your chest. 
That you'll look up any words you don't understand. 
That you've had misunderstandings. 
That you believe some things can be mended. 
That you have a dictionary and enough light. 
That the pages in your dictionary are arranged 
in consecutive order, that your definitions 
are close to the same as mine.
The fireflies might have been bouncing balls in a sing-along. 
You could have followed their luminous bellies, recited 
the right lyrics, and lied so easily. It was night. 
I wouldn't have believed you anyway, honest -- 
because of the raspberry liquor and the swaying candles. 
It wasn't even your boat in which we were going to make love. 
And I kept wondering if the flies, too, were for hire, 
like passionate fireworks so far away from the shore. 
It was a lie, a skit from Love American Style, 
except you didn't love me at all 

the night before Father's Day. I wasn't really young enough 
to be your daughter, but it was close. You kidded 
that you wanted a present because you had had four abortions, 
four trips to the clinic with three different women. 
I started to cry because of everything, 
but mostly because you'd forgotten my birthday. 
You said as though I had no right to my tears, 
"Look, I never thought about you in that way at all. 
You were just fun to have sex with. 
You're a spunky girl, but honestly, you're not even my type." 

It was like Christmas in an awful house 
with no presents, just a blaring tv, and no one even trying 
to sing a carol or make a turkey. 
A voice in my head said, "You can fix this. You can fix this." 
But was it my house or yours? It was a whole different 
time, in a different part of the country. 
A stronger voice in my head, 
one that I usually only hear witnessing accidents 
or getting a phone call about death, 
said, "Get out. Get out for your life." 

I looked through the porthole. Could I swim to shore? 
What was lurking in the bay water? The dinghy, 
like a diaphragm, elaborately tied up in knots, would take too long.
"I'm an old man, and I still look at each woman 
I pass on the street. I wonder if she's wearing a bra 
or the color of her pubic hair -- I can't help it." 
I was the child whose mind, in part, is off, far away. 
Another part was stuck listening to a ranting parent. 
You were unbuttoning your shirt like it was a turn-on, 
regardless of me, regardless that I was planning my escape.
Well, maybe that explains everything. 
In your house in Key West, where the pastels of the town 
must have driven you crazy, above the fireplace mantle -- 
like an expose -- you're pictured in frills as a toddler. 
"Knickers were fashionable for boys," 
the tour guide explains, "But Hemingway's mother, well..."
Her perky voice trails off as though, after all these tourists, 
she still hasn't found the right words. 

But there you are again, all grown up and in plaid flannel, 
against the far wall. "You'll notice," the tour guide says now, 
her monologue-pace restored, "Our Hemingway was quite a sportsman." 
You stand with an enormous fish, cranked so that its nose 
is to the ground in defeat -- its tail is hoisted straight up, 
making the fish double your height. 
And in another photo, you hold a pair of antlers, 
proud and with no apology, as though they were a bowling trophy. 

Deer heads and moose heads are mounted in your study to extinguish 
any lingering doubt. You typed with two fingers and married 
four times, each wife dismissed when she showed too much independence. 
Liquor-locks, around the vodka insured no one would drink 
unless you were home. But bored with you always gone, Pauline, 
Mrs. Hemingway-number-three, put in a pool and raised 
the kitchen counter six inches so you'd have no excuses -- from now on 
you could clean your own fish without straining your back. 

Hemingway, we know you loved cats, but you even machoed that, 
bringing home a urinal from Sloppy Joe's 
to make into a drinking trough for your pets who'd leave a line, 
a geometric progression of offspring. Mutant cats, 
every generation with more toes than the last, each extra 
jutting from a front paw like a little potent penis. 
Maybe you were rough, wrestling the kittens and throwing them 
into the pool, then toweling them dry, saying things like "Ah shucks."

And it's true, mothers so often get blamed for it all -- but a dress? 
Some whisper also that your father was henpecked. 
Freud was forty-nine when you wore a skirt for the last time, 
and he would have forgiven you, freely, the way we do -- the way 
you forgave your mother when you dragged your three-legged labor chair 
to a bullfight, and sat in it to watch the gore. Did you think 
of your mother as you sat, as though daring someone to make fun, 
in an antique chair in which antique women actually gave birth?
I know you won't mind if I ask you to put this on. 
It's for your protection as well as mine -- Wait. 
Wait. Here, before we rush into anything 
I've bought a condom for each one of your fingers. And here -- 
just a minute -- Open up. 
I'll help you put this one on, over your tongue. 
I was thinking: 
If we leave these two rolled, you can wear them 
as patches over your eyes. Partners have been known to cry, 
shed tears, bodily fluids, at all this trust, at even the thought 
of this closeness.
I run into my old boyfriend's new boyfriend 
on Boylston Street and, as he talks, I fish around 
in my handbag, my pockets, for something sharp 
so I can stab him. He prattles insensitive circles: 
how my old boyfriend is impossible, but I already know that. 
I want to call him queer boy, a faggot: he keeps calling me "hun," 
twirling the fringe on my scarf. We have nothing in common 
until his goodbye: pink gums show between his teeth 
and upper lip. He has my goofy kind of smile, 
the kind my old boyfriend always made fun of. 
Boy, is this guy in for trouble.
My dentist was Doctor Alexander. 
I chose him because he was within walking distance. 
There was no indication in the phone book 
that he was into S&M. I might have been 
into it too, if I could have played S, 
but stuck as an M in his chair as he patted the top of my head, 
I felt queasy when he seductively said 
he'd checked me out 
long enough to find a cavity 
because he likes all the young pretty ones to come back 
before their customary six months. 
I brushed him off, anesthetized to the routine 
of hooting and whistling 
women encounter everyday 
on twentieth century New York City streets, the sleazy smiles 
and hands pawing ours 
when we get change with our newspapers. 
So I kept my next dentist engagement, dreading it 
only slightly more than a usual visit. 
This time Doctor Alexander wanted to give me a crown -- 
a $650 expenditure if I'd go away with him 
for a weekend. We could get to know each other first, 
he reasoned, as the procedure takes four or five visits. 
But all that gold wouldn't have shown, 
wouldn't have taken me any closer to royalty. 
My dentist retaliated to my polite rejection -- 
pinched me with a Novocaine needle, 
then drilled way too deep, hitting a nerve. 
His square dental light loomed like the flash of white 
before the start of a horror movie -- one I, at that moment, 
decided to write the script for -- warrior women 
with teeth in their vaginas to curtail their rapists. 
Doctor Alexander asked me a question about what I did 
for a living, pretending I'd be able to answer 
though both his hands worked in my mouth. 
Then he volunteered he'd become a dentist
because the pay is terrific and there are no emergencies 
in the middle of the night. Once, in a childhood fight, 
my sister bit my arm as hard as she could, 
her upper and lower biting partners 
trying to connect, to rip through my flesh. 
The imprints she left 
were like horse shoes, battle scars of good luck, 
that bruised into purple, pale blue, then faint green. 
Doctor Alexander had no way of knowing that this was the memory 
he was inspiring in me, but I knew he could see, 
on the occlusal surfaces of each of my teeth, 
little imprints and shadows like characters 
of a language neither of us could understand. 
They spelled out my learned and archetypical rage 
at every situation this reminded me of. 
The dentist's metal explorer and drill bits 
righteously displayed on his instrument tray, 
his towel clip civilly clutching the paper bib under my chin. 
He could lower or elevate me at his will 
with the lift pedal at his feet. Human teeth 
last longer than bones which is why 
some have looked to them, instead of the stars, 
for answers. Crowded-toothed persons 
never straying from home, pointy-toothed others 
unworthy of trust, and those unfortunates 
with spaces between their two front teeth 
never to be happily married. Babies 
born with nubs of enamel 
poking through their gums, the wisest of all. 
Doctor Alexander's handpiece hissed, then stopped 
for the last time in my presence. 
As he silently stirred the silver paste 
with which he'd fill his mistake -- 
a sparkling inlay in my upper second molar -- 
I pictured the future of women, 
what part of them would live on 
long after their flesh and skeletons -- 
their lips no longer there to purse or frown, their fists 
and legs no longer there to clench and kick -- 
only their smiles left to grin and bear it.
It has something to do with sex, I've read. 
Teeth hanging by gum threads. I twist and swing 
them, cradle-like, with my tongue, a thick wind 
rocking tree-bound babes, while keeping them embedded. 
And what if they're grown-up? It's cold and hard 
as a coffin, this stretcher. Wind-up choppers 
clatter among scalpels, circular mirrors, 
liplessly wording, Your smile won't grow back.
What has been under pillows? Teeth, a gasp -- 
piggy bank quarters or nickels closing eyes. 
And the gynecologist won't hear my heart 
as he fits me for dentures, so I start 
to sprout, all molars, bicuspids, canines 
and incisors from my antarctic mouth.

Since AIDS, a rape is worse than rape, 
we were just saying that the other day. 
Then it happened. Worse than we could have expected. 
You were sleeping in your loft bed 
six feet from the floor, and nowhere to go, 
when you woke to his knees on your shoulders, 
his hand on your face, and a knife at your throat. 
Such awful aftershave, you choked 
and wiggled just enough to free your mouth 
from his palm, to take an occasional breath. 
He could have crushed you, broken your neck 
with one arm behind his back. He said that. 
He said he was showing you mercy. 
He said it was the first time 
he'd done anything like this, 
like you were so special. And there was a mask 
on his face for the occasion, 
and you woke to him there with you in your bed, 
darker than your worst childhood fears. 
Darker than dreams of ovens and coffins, 
you wait for your period, 
pray you are HIV negative, 
and will wait again for a test in another six months. 
America is a place where all privacy is gone, 
we were just saying that the other day. 
We were saying maybe it's because one day soon 
there will be no room for any of us 
to have as much as a lawn. But we were just talking, 
we didn't really expect it -- 
this man who raped you, who snuck 
through a back window, and then left 
through a front door.
I'm jealous when my mother touches anything else. 
The potatoes that roll in the stainless steel sink. 
The water runs and my mother rubs each bump -- 
under their chins, behind their necks -- clean. 
Sometimes she bathes me here, washes my hair 
kneading small circles on my scalp. I trust her, 
"Keep your eyes closed. Cover your ears." 
Now there's a flame, small and round as a hand mirror 
taunting from under the pot on the stove, 
"Who is the fairest child of all?" 
And I stand on a chair to watch water bubbles pop a soft "Oh no," 
then disappear. My mother gently plunks potatoes in, one by one, 
and says, "Careful not to tip. These will be done 
when the skins crack, when I can stick a fork in." 

There was a mother in the newspaper this week 
who cooked her baby and served it to her husband 
as though it were a chicken.
If Daniel Rakowitz had only dreamt 
about eating Monika Beerle's flesh, 
these dreams possibly could have expressed 
his desire to live off her money 
or perhaps his devouring passion -- 
with an element of oral sadism. 
Or even a regression on his part, 
an attempt to psychically reincorporate with his mother -- 
reverse the process of his being disgorged 
from her during delivery, 
as if the opposite of birth 
wasn't really death at all. 

But it wasn't a dream: 
Monika's head boiling in her own pot, on her own stove. 
Daniel seasoning, then eating, her brains and her heart. 
Some say he thought in this Satanic-cult-way 
that he would finally be able to control her. 
But could it be, instead, that she's wound up 
controlling him? Maybe now, in prison, Daniel dances 
the way Monika had at Martha Graham. 
Maybe he will suddenly share her love for everybody, 
including Jews and Gays and Rastafarians. 
Maybe he will develop a taste 
for things Swiss. Yes, maybe now, in prison,

Daniel will become Christian, 
having had Monika as his communion. 
So transformed, he will apologize to the cops 
for ever having called any of them pigs, and 
because of his sincerity, the courts will set him free 
so he can play himself 
in the made-for-tv movie. Then, with the money he makes, 
maybe he'll begin his own ministry. He'll return 
to feeding the homeless in Tompkins Square Park, 
but with more of Monika's gracefulness, a lighter step. 
Maybe Daniel will teach us, through his transformation 
and repentance, no one can ever truly destroy a spirit.
Jung says the soul is round. 
And so is a bird bath. Round? 
So are the bracelet slots of handcuffs and mounds 
rising on a pair of brass knuckles. 
Jung says the soul is round. 
And I see its reflection everywhere 
in one of the poorest parks in America. 
What I want to say first is there are no flowers, 
but then joy takes over because there is the sun and an orange 
a gray man is gratefully holding. 
And the round pockmarks on the orange. 
Summers before, there have been riots, 
but today in the park, a library book 
rests in a child's lap. His wooly head peers 
at a picture of a round pie before it's been cut. 
The fork marks around its perimeter 
as mysterious as designs on a mandala. 
A hoola hoop flies askew on a young girl's hips, 
a ring around her rhythm of Saturn. 
The tiny unseen beads swishing music in her striped loop. 
The parabloid trash receptacles. 
And that round sun again that doesn't let up. 
The spidery umbrella, no longer any good against the rain -- 
a floppy parasol, doing what it can, 
over the fair round and round-freckled redhead.
Please, just give me a map, and I'll follow it. 
And, if I'm worthy, throw in a sign -- 
maybe a miracle to show me I'm on the right track 

or a coincidence, a deja vu so strong 
I'll say, "Aha! This is the way to heaven." 
Dear Mother, Father, Brother, Sister, or Genderless-One, 

I live among your humblest achievers. It was easy 
for me to get A's in school because I was told 
what to study, and I did it. My meals 

always look exactly as they do in the pictures 
of the cook book. I'm not a deviant. I'm only here 
to serve you, whoever you are, but like 

an overwhelmed waitress, I'm not sure 
you're in my section of tables. I run around 
in Zen circles, climb the highest totem pole -- I love all 

the directions of the cross: West, North, East, and South. 
I love the twelve apostles and the zodiac. The numbers, 
the colors, the letters of a name all mean something to me. 

The lines on my palm, the configuration of my tea leaves. 
The tarot, the runes, the pennies, and the I Ching. 
But like a sorceress pleasing too many masters 

and mistresses, too many shepherds at once, 
I am a sheep and, as you know, a consumer -- therefore I need to 
be told what to buy. And you must understand this -- 

even paintings of baby Jesus change through the ages: 
sometimes he's fat, black or white, sometimes lean. 
So Goddesses and Gods, I plead again for direction. If only 

you could put me on a special mailing list -- or send me 
an advertisement like the ones that only go out 
to preferred shoppers announcing a special sale in advance. 

Show me the way, and I'll go. In the meantime, you'll find me 
down by the river, getting close to what is left 
of nature. I'll wrap my arms around me mummy-style and roll 

down the biggest hill -- sky, grass, sky, grass, sky, grass -- 
and wait for your reply. I'm ready for anything. Maybe 
you'll be little green men and women. Maybe 

you'll charge out of the doors of your flying saucers 
on horseback. Maybe you'll plant kisses 
on all of us, on each Earth-bound Beauty's sleeping cheek.
You said that if we could just touch 
we'd be able to figure it out. 
Your palm scanned me up and down 
like we were two parts of the same computer -- 
screen and mouse, bytes and search keys, 
orphans and widows, open windows. 
Your hand finally found what she wanted: 
the pea under my mattress. We referenced 
my clitoris, then cross-filed it 
with beauty, ocean, politics, the deep. 
We grew small in each others arms 
the way lovers can in their dreams. 
Then I exclaimed the pea was a pearl. 
Each ring shadowed a halo. Lifejackets bloomed 
the colors of tropical fruits. 
Knowing no ending was completely happy, 
we slipped through mighty thorns, 
sliding safely through technology 
until there was enough room for us 
to be home wherever we went.
The sky sings in plurals. 
Sun, moon. Moon, earth. Star, wish, and us. 
At night we wake to these songs 
which circle like whole notes, whole rings 
around the earth, around Saturn, and Venus. 
Mars, we hear this singing, half cold 
and half light. Beyond buildings, beyond traffic, 
sometimes beyond text books or maps, all eyes raise 
seemingly at once. EGBDF: 
Every Good Boy Does Fine. This was the way we learned 
what sounds rested on what lines of our music books. 
Our ears, bass clefs, trembling cliffs 
with small oceans inside, keep our balance 
and ping with this cadence. Like spoons 
tapping on glasses of water, on glasses of wine, 
the stars sing in the sky. So even when we pull away 
like receding waves to look at our sorrow, to look 
without love at each other, we are struck by the curve 
of these sounds which pull us, rising, always 
reaping, always towards joy.
When Cindy Shaw told me 
her mother wrote The Happy Hooker
I believed her. On our way to Scarborough 
Beach, we read passages aloud 
from the creased paperback. 
All three of us in the front seat 
of the powder blue Cadillac 
convertible. Mrs. Shaw's pink kerchief 
flapping like a cheerleader's skirt, 
her platinum waves stuck in place. 
Lucky, their black labrador, sprawled 
on the back seat, barking 
sometimes when we laughed. 

Mrs. Shaw told us everything. 
She would make up our bottom lips 
with her gooey finger 
then point to her breasts 
between the plunge in her bathing suit, 
asking Cindy or me to lean over and check 
if her freckles were turning into sunspots. 
She had stillborn triplets once 
and said she was too old now 
to go through three more births. 
Maybe I was like one of the daughters 
she'd lost. She buried the babies 
giving them names all beginning with "C."

Cindy's magazines spread out 
on the blanket, blazing fingernails 
and hair. We watched Mrs. Shaw giggle 
for lifeguards, pretending to chase Lucky 
in shallow waves, while we tugged 
at our suits all gritty. In the shower 
Mrs. Shaw promised an "R" rated drive-in 
and hooked each one of us for a moment 
into her bra. She pinched at what she called 
"two empty sandpails." Then she made us 
swear not to tell Mr. Shaw any of this. 
His construction working hands seemed 
sometimes as big as car fins.
The blue of Bill's Pet Shop fish tank was all 
I knew to know, so down, down, eyes open 
for pastel gravel, plastic scuba men, 
sausaged air on their backs. My slow fall. 
I was thinking wax bottles, sweet liquid 
inside, the penny-candy case Terry 
kept in her store: Snow White-like I would be 
laid next to gummy fish, magical-dead. 
Then, nothing at once, but a seaweed bruise. 
Grasses of mangers or Easter baskets, 
muddle of holy days. Palm, pine, confused. 
I was just six enough to know regrets. 
My sister kicking, sunlit, above me: 
Sweet Jesus. Her feet, I must kiss her feet.
There were always two of everything (one for each of us) but 
in different colors so we wouldn't get mixed up, and 
one color, we thought, was always definitely better. The one 
both of us, of course, definitely wanted. The same thing 
was true with lunch boxes -- they may have both been 
blue, but with unlike logos. Or 
shoes -- one pair with laces, another with buckles. 
Or two music boxes, but with separate songs. 

With their girls only one year and four days apart, our parents 
didn't have time to learn how to play favorites. Twins, 
some people thought we were. Our Zodiac sign Gemini, we multiplied 
times two our personalities, times two 
what we really felt inside, times two 
because there were two of us. And when we fought, 
someone usually said, "You just want that 
because your sister does, too." 

But some things in two 
were more clearly unequal: the foretelling halves 
of a wishbone; heads or tails meant one of us had to lose; 
or the samara twirling like a green set of wings 
from the maple tree in our yard. When an adult 
snapped one apart and handed each of us a section to open 
and wear on our noses, one side was always blessed 
with more sticky sap. And the less lucky of us 
had to hold the witchy nose-extender on with our fingers. 

And even though we weren't divided that terrible sibling way: 
one pretty, one smart -- one was prettier, one smarter. 
Those comparatives like: one had better boyfriends, 
longer hair, or nicer clothes, any given year. 
Or we were known by events. One played softball, 
one couldn't. One cracked up the car, and one didn't. 
And although sometimes two seemed too much, sometimes 
it wasn't enough. We lost out, for example, on the superlatives: 

Being only two, we couldn't be the best of anything. 
We were more like our scrambling hands in the game we played -- 
opisthenar, palm, opisthenar, palm -- only one of us 
on top for a split second at a time. And as we grew, 
sharing the same room, one of us might have been watching tv 
while doing homework. The other 
talking on the phone while reading a magazine. And 
instinctively, like a conversation in stereo, 

we knew when to pass the com chips. So sometimes, 
when I think my sister's children are mine or 
my sister feels like she's just finished my poem, 
they are and she did, in that moment sometimes... 
because somewhere our mother closes her compact two-sided mirror, and, in a dark 
corner of her purse, the enlarged and lifesize 
reflect each other. And maybe somewhere our father 
tells a joke, how I kept the womb warm for the second one.
"See the way she fumbles for her keys while he keeps talking -- 
that's going to mean something later on." 
You were whispering to me about the movie on the screen 
of the Orson Welles Theater. In your third year of film school, 
you said with authority, "Because film is so expensive, 
                                                                                 nothing 

is shot that isn't connected later..." 
You paused when a character was killed, then continued: 
"Not like in novels. You don't have time to be sloppy 
with description -- will it matter after or not? 
"No, I think every word counts in fiction or poetry, too," 
I lamely said, my major English Lit. 

We didn't have sex, and though you didn't say, 
"That's going to mean something later on," 
it did. The track marks on your arm -- I thought 
they were as tragically romantic as suicide bracelets. 
You had been in a rehab, and I said, 
                                                       "Anyone 

overcoming such obstacles must be an angel." No one we knew then 
knew anything about AIDS. You said, "Let's not spoil our 
friendship," or something like that. And I stayed for the night 
anyway, falling asleep on your bed while you were looking 
through your books to show me something. You moved to Belgium 
that summer, and I never heard from you again. 

Walking home the next day I saw a little boy on the Fenway, 
his mother was whacking him on the back with her purse. 
"Son of a bitch," she said, "when will you learn to listen?" 
That's going to mean something later on -- 
someone is going to pay for this, 
                                                  I thought. 

But as though karma those days was a boomerang 
caught in a whirling wind and coming back off course, 
it was easy for me to feel like a victim. I was sure 
the witness would pay, or perhaps someone on this block 
whose windows were closed, who was cooking supper right then 
for her husband. But maybe if the moon is a projector, 
I reason, and our actions are now what happens on screen, 
then the karma is all right, though not always a karma 
of happy endings. The close-ups might be headlines: 
wars, land fills, national deficits. Or maybe 
our personal triumphs and tragedies. 
                                                          More likely wdre players 

in a thriller -- the audience watching us knows computers 
give us cancer, though the few characters who read about it 
in the New Yorker can't get their editorials published 
anywhere. And the cancer researcher is not-so-mysteriously 
bought out. I pray we are as precious as celluloid, 
and someone watching knows all of this means something.
I kiss a homeless woman on the lips, 
soothe the angry young man passing leaflets 
with a hug and his angry young causes dissolve. 
I tell the Yuppie couple, "I think you're nifty. 
I hope you get every appliance and gadget 
you want." I invite my new DINK neighbors 
(Double Income, No Kids) for dinner 
and a menage a trois. I pet a mangy dog who growls at me 
straining against his owner's leash 
while I hold a baby with a rash as his teenage mother 
folds up a stroller. A hood spits, missing 
the sidewalk, and hits my shoe. So what? 
I pay for a mustard-laced pretzel with a ten 
and tell the vendor, "You keep the change. 
I love everyone today. You's crazy lady," 
he says, looking afraid. And my feelings 
towards him, well, they don't change.
Oh, Mr. Ferris, what an invention! 
Your diagrams and blueprints, your wild imaginings 
finally turning, slow and high that initial time -- 
the toast of the fair, rising over the rest 
of flat Chicago. I feel like one of the first to ride 
this night of my birthday, a century later 
in another city, another state. The summer 
moon is rosy pink and maybe it's the climbing 
and falling like sex that makes the man 
who stands in front of my lover and I in the long line 
boast he's taken the same girl on this ride 
for twenty-six years in a row. His wife blushes, 
half of her coy, the other half embarrassed 
that her husband's so loud. I will be married 
in a couple of months, and in my mind 
my ring twirls like Mr. Ferris's first initials: 
W. G. W. Letters con-ting back 
to eclipse themselves. Ford Madox Ford. 
William Carlos Williams. The palindrome 
of my birth date and age: 13 and 31. 
My lover and I will kiss, sure 
we are blessed, every time 
we go over the top crest. 
The luck of the circle and the sun.
The manatee tries a diet of only sea grass, but still stays fat. 
Mistaking her for a mermaid from afar, 
sailors of long ago lost interest when they got too close, 
openly making fun of her chubbiness. She knows Rodney Dangerfield 
would write jokes about her if she were more popular. 
She's ashamed of her crooked teeth, her two big molars 
that leave her sucking and grinding 
with bad table manners. She swims towards danger 
over and over, scars from motor boats on her back 
reminders of her slow stupidness. She resents being 
called a sea-cow. She hopes her whiskers don't show 
in the light. She is the mammal who knows 
about low self-esteem. I first met her on my honeymoon 
in southern Florida. I was on a cruise in my one piece bathing suit. 
The women in bikinis squealed and pointed to the nearby dolphins, 
clapping so their sleek gray backs would come to the water's surface. 
In the shadow of her prettier ocean sister, the manatee swam by also. 
No one but I paid her much attention. I wanted to lend her 
my make-up, massage her spine, lend a girlfriend-ear 
and listen to her underwater troubles. I dreamt of her 
as I slept in the warmth of my new husband. I dreamt of her 
as he slept in the warmth of me. On a good day, too, 
I can relate to the manatee, who knows 
on some level that she is endangered 
and believes in mating for life.
No one warned me he'd long for loins and hocks 
so soon into our marriage. My husband munches from bags 
of second-choice pork rinds on the porch, not wanting to exclude me from the dinner 
he really wants to make. Back in college, his roommates loved his pork chops. 
At midnight he and his friends often drove to a diner famous for its spare ribs. 

I catch my husband looking longingly at the pork. 
I'm on my way from the dairy aisle and, not wanting to make it an issue 
then, place the milk and cottage cheese in our cart 
loud enough to give him warning. He obediently slides over to the chicken 
and picks out a four-pack of yellow dimply breasts. 

As a wife who doesn't eat red meat, I feel inadequate. I wiggle my toes in the pink 
slippers he gave me for Christmas. I've read enough to know what happens 
when husbands don't get what they want. Should he romanticize his unabashed 
pork-eating past, he'll start to resent me -- fast. I remember with a shudder 
his sheer pleasure when I passed him my slice of ham at our wedding reception. 

Whenever we're in a restaurant, he orders sides of bacon. I find cans 
of Spam and Bacos behind the breakfast cereal in the cupboard. 
I explain I'm not trying to hold him back, that he should eat pork in the house. 
I'm not self-righteous in my decision to keep boars and sows out of my diet. 
But always polite, my husband swears he doesn't want to. 

What's the fun of eating sausage alone? My girlfriend, who loves pork too, 
makes her point. Of course, I feel worse. Aren't I woman enough to meet 
my husband's needs? Threatened, I confront him about his behavior 
at the pork counter. At first he doesn't recall, then he says he was only looking. 
So now he's only looking. Marriage disasters from my childhood sizzle. 

Uncle Waldo always said, "Hey, it's not a crime to look, is it?" 
when a good-looking "babe" walked by. But Aunt Charlotte knew it was. 
After a few years, she threw all his clothes out of the window, crying it's over, 
calling him a swine. Always loving, my husband hugs and reassures me. 
I look down at my fuzzy slippers and feel better. Uncle Waldo hated pig's feet.
There was the expensive cream from France 
that promised the dimples would vanish 
if applied nightly to the problem spots. 
Then, when that didn't work, Kiko, the masseuse 
at Profile Health Spa, dug her thumbs 
deep into my flesh as she explained 
in quasi-scientific terms that her rough hands 
could break up the toughest globules of cellulite. 
I screamed, then bruised over, but nothing 
else happened. When they healed, my legs still looked 
like tapioca pudding. There was the rolling pin method 
I tried as far back as seventh grade, 
kneading my lumpy legs as though I was making bread. 
Cottage Cheese Knees, Thunder Thighs -- 
I heard it all -- under the guise of teasing, 
under the leaky umbrella mistaken for affection. 
I learned to choose long dresses 
and dark woolen tights, clam diggers instead of short-shorts, 
and, when I could get away with it, skirted bathing suits. 
The nutritionist said that maybe Royal Jelly tablets 
would break up the fat. I drank eight glasses 
of water everyday for a month. I ate nothing 
but steak for a week. I had to take everyone's advice, 
fearing that if I didn't, my thighs 
would truly be all my own fault. Liposuction 
cost too much. The foil sweat-it-out 
shorts advertised in the back of Redbook 
didn't work. Swimming, walking in place, leg lifts. 
It's embarrassing, especially being a feminist. 
I wondered if Andrea Dworkin had stopped worrying, 
and how. If Gloria Steinem does aerobics, 
claiming it's just for her own enjoyment. 
Then I read in a self-help book: 
if you learn to appreciate your thighs, they'll appreciate 
you back. Though it wasn't romance at first sight, 
I did try to thank my legs for carrying me up nine flights 
the day when the elevator at work was out; 
for their quick sprint that propelled me 
through the closing doors of the subway 
so that I wouldn't be late for a movie; 
for supporting my nieces who straddled, one 
on each thigh, their heads burrowing deep into my lap. 
I think, in fact, that it was at that moment 
of being an aunt I forgot for an instant 
about my thigh dilemma and began, more fully, 
as they say, enjoying my life. So when it happened later 
that I fell in love, and as a bonus, 
the man said he liked my thighs, I shouldn't have been 
so thoroughly surprised. At first I was sure I'd misheard -- 
that he liked my eyes, that he had heard someone else sigh, 
or that maybe he was having a craving for french fries. 
And it wasn't very easy to nonchalantly say oh, thanks
after I'd made him repeat. I kept asking 
if he was sure, then waiting for a punch 
line of some mean-spirited thigh-related joke. 
I ran my fingers over his calf, brown and firm, 
with beautiful muscles waving down the back. 
It made no sense the way love makes no sense. 
Then it made all the sense in the world.

NOTES
Back then only Sun Woman had a vagina. 
Only Sun Woman and her brother Moon Man 
had anuses. They traveled, not knowing their privilege 
until they came upon a settlement. Outside the igloos 
were lumps of caribou breasts and rich suet -- 
the villagers had to suck their meat without swallowing 
since there was no way for them to expel it. 
Babies back then were cut from the womb, the mother 
sewn back together with braided caribou sinew. 
Sister Sun and Brother Moon wanted the kind of love 
siblings could not give to each other 
so they looked among the people for companions. 
Moon Man, to consummate his marriage, took a knife 
and gently slit his wife in the crotch. Instead of blood, 
a vulva and vagina appeared. Sister Sun 
was the first in the village to give birth 
by breaking her water and going into labor. 
Her baby was the first of the village to have both genitals 
and an anus. The women of the settlement sang their praises, 
wielding knives between their legs. Then, men 
and women alike seized meat forks 
and stabbed themselves in the rear. 
Those who hit the right places gained anuses 
and the party began. People, like none other before them, 
gobbled down food and gulped up love.
There was a giant who was particularly fond of humans. 
He camped near them, his lice -- white bears and white wolves. 
He drank whole lakes when he grew thirsty 
and generated winds throughout Siberia. He once fell in love 
with an Inuk woman, and since he was already married, 
convinced the woman's husband to swap his wife 
for the giant's. The husband was tempted by the thought 
of enormous green female genitals 
and agreed without asking his wife's opinion. The giant 
picked up the woman in his palm and blew back her hair 
with a sigh. The man swam in the folds of the female giant's vulva 
and she barely knew he was there. He disappeared 
in her vagina and was never seen again. 
Although he tried to be kind, the giant 
split the woman in half. He returned to his giant wife, 
the one he was made for. As they kissed, 
ice floes cracked. The whole ground shook.
Her black hair was as slick as a seal's, her face as round 
as any planet. Her eyes were empty bowls 
after a measly meal, her first young love dead 
at the bottom of the sea. He had drowned while fishing, 
the villagers told her, without the proof of a body. Other suitors 
began to call, but all she could see was the ocean inside them. 
Friends bought her gifts of blubber, the consoling magic of whales 
that was both food and lamp oil, the energy 
of life. The mourning girl carved her love's face 
in the fat that once breathed between the skin and muscle 
of a swimming mammal. Her creation looked so much like him, 
she continued to carve his whole body, miniature details coming back to her 
as though she were still lying in his viable arms. She rubbed 
her soft blubber sculpture against her vulva 
until it grew, first the size of a puppet, then a child. 
The blubber began to rub back, sprouting at incredible speed 
and when the girl came, her dead love was alive again. 
The villagers thought it a miracle. There was a party 
and a wedding the very next day. The young couple 
kept their secret, the blubber lubricant, a special part 
of their sex. When it was time for the boy to go back to work, 
he set out in the very same fishing boat from which he fell 
and drowned. The girl begged him to stay home, 
but the boy convinced her that they were running low on salted mackerel. 
Out in the sun, he felt himself beginning to melt, 
his skin not quite human skin, his heart beating double time. 
He paddled to shore as quickly as he could, then ran. 
He was only half his man-size when he reached the igloo they shared. 
The girl packed her husband in snow, massaging his body, 
watching him grow. As the years went on, she never used the word 
burden, though she grew tired doing all the heavy work herself. 
Blubber boy lost his spunk, his fear of anything warm interfering 
with even their lovemaking. He feared fire, 
sweat, circulation, sparks, the very insulation from which he'd sprung.
He could have had anything he wanted. 
A caribou with special powers had granted him a wish. 
But all he craved were his wife's long nails against his back. 
Every night after the hunt, this is what he'd ask: 
Wife, please scratch me hard.
This wife loved her husband and worried because his back 
was getting so red. 
But his itch was as deep as the middle of the earth. 
When she stopped, he cried and could not fall asleep. 
This wife loved her husband and worried because he 
was starting to bleed. 
But his satisfaction was as far away as the sun. 
He begged her to get the scraper she used on hides and use it on him. 
This wife loved her husband who was now only bones. 
She kept stepping over the pile long after her neighbors buried him.
This couple couldn't figure it out. 
The man licked his wife's genitals while she stared straight ahead. 
The woman poked her husband's testicles with her nose. 
The man put his toe in the folds of the woman's vulva. 
The woman took the man's penis under her armpit. 
Neither one of them wanted to be the first to admit 
something was off. So it went on -- 
the man put his finger in his wife's navel. 
The woman batted her eyelashes against the arch of her husband's foot. 
They pinched each other's earlobes. They bit each other's rear ends. 
To perpetrate the lie, they ended each encounter with a deep sigh. 
Then one day while the husband was hunting, 
a man stopped by the igloo and said to the wife: 
I hear you have been having trouble. 
I can show you how to make love.
He took her to bed and left before the husband came home. 
Then the wife showed her husband, 
careful to make it seem like the idea sprang 
from both. After all these years of rubbing one's face against the other's belly 
or stroking a male elbow behind a female knee, 
this couple had a lot of catching up to do. They couldn't stop to eat or sleep 
and grew so skinny they died. No one found them for a long time. 
And by then, their two skeletons were fused into one.
Everyone knows not to have sex after handling a corpse. 
But Him-Whose-Penis-Stretches-Down-To-His-Knees 
pointed to his groin and said, "This big fellow isn't afraid of taboos." 
His wife warned him, but he just laughed as he rolled her onto her back. 
The next day a huge raven rose up from a boulder 
and grabbed the penis of Him-Whose-Penis-Stretches-Down-To-His-Knees. 
The raven tugged as though the penis were a frozen piece of fish. 
The raven tugged until he tore off most of the penis, then flew away. 
Now people from the village point to the man 
whose urges couldn't wait one more day. 
They taunt him by calling out his new name: Him-Whose-Penis-
Barely-Peeps-From-Its-Cave.
There was a husband who married a wife he found so beautiful 
that his penis was in a state of constant arousal. 
His wife was delicate and needed her sleep, but the needy penis 
kept after her night and day. She served her husband dinner 
and he wanted to have sex. Her shoulder brushed his as she passed 
in the igloo's passage way and he wanted to have sex again. 
He often woke her up in the middle of the night, his hard penis 
nudging against her soft thigh. 
Soon he'd rubbed inside her so many times, that her vagina 
wore away. The husband didn't see his mistake 
and stroked his penis between her knees until his wife had no more legs. 
He used up her belly and her arms. Her breasts were next 
to disappear. When nothing was left that he could touch, 
Him-Whose-Penis-Never-Slept ejaculated into his wife's shadow. 
It vanished, his semen a liquid ghost dripping down a lonely snow wall.
His two wives never mentioned it, because, other than that, 
he was a nice husband. He hunted big caribou 
and told good stories. He let them sleep near him, 
where it was warm. But one day when they were curing the meat 
while their fired husband rested, one said to the other, 
"Do you love your husband?" 
"Yes," she answered, "Do you?" 
They nudged each other and went to the husband's bed. 
They took off his blanket, then his pants. 
They meant to arouse him but instead they burst out laughing 
at his tiny flaccid penis which was barely even there. 
That woke up the husband. And though the wives wouldn't tell 
why they were laughing, the husband guessed. He asked them to make a fire 
and when they did, he poured oil all over it. 
He threw them in one by one, then jumped in himself, 
his shame that big, his penis that small.
Kinnaq could not get his penis into any of the normal places. 
He often saw women he wanted to fuck, 
but somehow they always got away 
at the last minute. Kinnaq took four girls, 
one by one, across the river just to get to the last one, 
the one he thought the prettiest. When finally 
he had her in his kayak, he let the current take them 
downstream. The girl shouted 
that they were going the wrong way, 
and sensing danger, took the sinew 
that held her braids and tied Kinnaq's parka 
to his kayak. Then she begged him to pull over to the bank 
so she could shit. When he did, she ran up the bluff, 
beyond a point where Kinnaq could see her. 
By the time he began to chase her, 
the intricate knots the girl had made 
forced him to drag his kayak with him. He easily gave up, 
spotting a lemming hole. He took out his penis 
and fucked the burrow instead. 

Another time, Kinnaq fucked the ventilation hole 
on the roof of an igloo in a strange village. 
Two old women who lived inside smelled his penis 
and began to argue over who would have the man first. 
Giggling, they chased Kinnaq all the way to his kayak, 
but he didn't find the old women attractive. 
He pushed off down river, his departure an insult to them, 
an insult to their defiled snow hut. The old women 
cursed Kinnaq's penis, which they called an usak.
As he paddled away, he felt his penis growing, not as a result 
of lust, not as a result of cold. He stuffed his lengthy usak
into his boot, then when it wouldn't stop getting bigger, 
dragged it behind his boat. The children waiting on shore for him 
thought Kinnaq's penis was a catch, so they chopped 
what they thought was a strange fish into bits 
and began chewing pieces of it.
One day a fisherman's penis got tangled up in his harpoon line. 
The fisherman was never really good at catching seals 
and as both prey and hunter tugged and hauled in opposite directions, 
the man felt all the strength gush out of his penis. 
He was relieved, if the truth be known. 
He went home and dressed up like a woman. 
He called himself Vagina and announced he was in need of a husband. 
His mother was not happy about this. 
She threatened to kick her son, who was now her daughter, out of the house 
if he didn't again dress like a man and go out on the hunt. 
Vagina knew a little magic, so she stripped the skin from her body 
until she was just a skeleton. Her mother dropped dead in fright. 
Vagina put her skin back on and started to behave 
more and more like a woman. She fretted with her hair 
and drew little tattoos all over her arms. Monthly 
she made cuts at her groin so she could bleed. 
She spent her days quietly softening fox skins with her teeth. 
Vagina was still having trouble getting a husband 
when a neighbor agreed to loan hers. When Vagina 
removed her dress, the neighbor's husband 
noticed her penis and called Vagina a madman. 
Again, Vagina removed her skin as if to prove deep down 
there was no difference between women and men 
and their skeletons. Instead of consenting to have sex, 
the man was so frightened he fell dead, like Vagina's mother, on the spot. 
Vagina thought at least she could adopt 
and then a child would provide her with company. 
There was an orphan no one else would have. 
Vagina tended to him like the kindest of mothers 
until one day the boy demanded blubber. 
"Can't you see I'm a woman?" Vagina said, 
"I'm not allowed on the hunt. Find yourself a father, 
a husband for me, and then we'll have plenty to eat." 
The orphan was sharp. He had seen Vagina pissing 
while standing up. He accused his mother of being a man. 
Vagina, on impulse, became a skeleton again.
The orphan, instead of being scared, ran his fingers 
over his mother's eyeball sockets and ribs. He drew a circle 
around her pelvis and laughed. Vagina was forced 
to use stronger magic. She reached into her chest 
and pulled out her entrails. "There," she exclaimed, 
"do you still insist on having some blubber?" 
The orphan hugged his mother as some dogs 
burst their way into the igloo, 
stealing, among other things, Vagina's intestines. 
She shouted, "Stop!" and chased the dogs 
for miles. But before she could catch up, the biggest dog had eaten her heart. 
And everyone knows a person is nothing without that. 
Slowly Vagina wasted away as the orphan watched. 
The orphan buried his mother beneath a pile of stones, 
loving her in spite of her magic and foolish penis. 
Loving his dead mother in spite of her skeleton games, 
the orphan went to search for seals and whales and blubber on his own.
A man and a woman couldn't have any children. 
No one knew whose fault it was. This couple was unhappy 
and the butt of jokes. The man sucked on his wife's breasts. 
The woman cradled her husband in her arms. 
But pretending about babies wasn't enough.
So the man headed South where a woman shaman, 
who had gained her powers in being struck by lightning, 
was sometimes able to help the barren. 
The shaman handed the husband two dried fish. 
If you want a boy, give your wife this boy fish. 
It you want a girl, give her the fish that is a girl.
The hopeful husband jumped into his kayak 
anxious to get the fertile fish home. But it wasn't long 
until the husband grew hungry, and weighing 
the fish in both of his palms, decided that it wouldn't be that bad 
to eat the fish that was a girl, since it was a boy child he really wanted. 
So he ate the female fish, the soft bones scraping his throat. 
Soon a cramp, then a bout of nausea that wasn't seasickness. 
By the time he arrived home, he could barely squeeze himself 
out of his boat. His belly stretched far ahead of him 
as though it wanted to leave and walk away on its own. 
His wife recognized the signs and tended to her husband 
day and night. When he gave birth to a little baby girl, 
she slipped through him like a fish and flopped 
into the cold air. What did it matter 
if one of her mothers was also her father?
A long time ago, before women had individual wombs, 
babies were dug up from the earth -- girl children 
underfoot about six inches, boy children hidden deep. 
Industrious women had babies like potatoes, 
digging all day to find infants. Lazy women 
had one or sometimes no children at all. Kaku 
wanted very much to be a mother, but as she plowed 
with sticks and spoons, she found only rocks, 
an occasional ring. She traveled far, overturning 
almost half of the earth and the snow that covered it, 
but birthed no one. The village looked down on her, 
a barren woman, and skeptic eyebrows rose 
when Kaku complained that it wasn't fair, 
she tried so hard. One day, after passing mothers 
with as many as thirteen babies, Kaku 
decided to take drastic measures. She began 
to excavate a distant spot, searching for many days 
past buried treasure, past coffins, through a hot red middle 
she suspected was the sun. It was a long time before 
she popped up like a bubble through a straw 
and was way on the other side of the world. 
Everything there was upside-down. Roots of trees 
swirled where clouds should have been. 
The snow on the ground was white sky. 
People ate with the fines of their forks 
pointed up. Kaku was surprised to learn 
that in this part of the world, babies were bigger 
than their mothers. She was quickly adopted 
by a giant girl and boy baby who fed her 
and washed her and dressed her in new clothes. 
The babies were kinder than any parents 
Kaku could have imagined and, for a while, 
she was happy to be away from the cruelty 
and gossip of her village. But sometimes 
at night she pictured a wreath inside her 
and the empty space within the curving garland 
ached. Soon she ran away from her two huge parents, 
past inverted hills, concaves in the earth, 
past valleys that ballooned higher than any mountains 
back home. The Claw-Trolls tore at her flesh. 
A Scourge-Troll slapped a seal against her groin. 
Still, she traveled on, beyond the violence, 
as her adoptive baby-parents mourned her. 
After many days she found another passageway 
back to the other side of the earth, past worms, 
past skeletons, past that hot middle, that red egg yolk. 
When she had almost reached her village, 
she saw a bulge of dirt that could only mean one thing. 
She tore towards the breathing 
where the most beautiful baby boy was sleeping. 
She took him home to wash him off. 
She slept with the old boy on her chest, 
dreaming dream after dream -- that he would be 
an explorer, some kind of a king, a rich man, 
a man of great discovery.
I tried everything to have a child, 
slept with my naked genitals 
tempting the moonlight, drank 
water when the full moon shone on it. 
The Moon Man was hogging all the unborn babies 
and when he flew to earth to impregnate women, 
he always skipped me. Instead he'd surprise a young girl 
with a child, or throw down an infant 
to a grandmother. It wasn't until my husband 
sent a shaman to visit the Moon 
that the Man up there even learned my name. But our baby 
will be the best baby of all, all that more special 
because we had to wait. 
Now that I am finally pregnant 
my husband gives me his semen every night 
which feeds our baby while she's in me. 
Sometimes a drop remains on his penis 
as pearly white as the moon, 
as pearly round as my womb.
The first mother wanted a baby so badly that she said she would have slept with an evil spirit to get hirn. Of course, she didn't; she slept with her husband, but uttering those words cursed her. Her face shone, like any other woman's during pregnancy, yet this mother needed to eat so much meat to gain even the smallest amount of weight. When her baby was born, its eyes were red. It didn't appear to have formed a sex. Yet all this mother could see was love, so she bit the umbilical chord, then pulled the baby to her breasts. 

The baby's fists were heavy and pointed like spears. It beat its mother and began to eat her. First her little finger, then her knuckles. Then her arms, then her torso. When nothing was left, the baby began to smack its own chest, until it cried its first cry, then died. 

* * *
The second mother was so lonely she took home a larva and nursed it under her armpit. Her baby was white as a cloud, smoke, or snow. She taught the larva to talk in the evenings. She was proud, as it was growing to be the biggest larva in the village. Sometimes the mother became fired giving her child so much blood and needed a walk in the brisk air to revive her. 

When the larva grew bigger than its mother, it begged to go out and see the other snow-huts and meet some neighbors. The mother allowed this, though like all mothers she worried about her child's safety. The villagers were afraid of the gigantic larva which resembled a dead spirit. The larva was kind and sang gentle songs, but, due to its appearance, it could not easily win affection. 

One day when the mother was away, and the larva was home playing, a group of people stormed into the snow-hut where the woman lived, and threw her baby-larva to a pack of dogs. There was blood everywhere when the dogs were finished because even that many dogs couldn't eat so much blood. 

* * *
The third mother's baby was nothing but air, except for the dust particles that were its eyes. Some thought she was making the whole baby thing, up, that because this mother wanted a baby so badly, she dreamt it. Her husband tolerated the baby made of air, but never paid it too much attention. When he wasn't away hunting, he liked to overeat then sleep as many as twelve hours in a row. 

The mother sang her baby songs about the days when igloos could fly, when all air really was full of mystery. She blew hot breath onto the invisible baby's neck, as she would a piece of frozen fish so that her lips or tongue wouldn't stick when she ate. 

Only once did this mother begin to scold her baby, and as she took a deep angry breath, she sucked the baby up. The baby's head went through its mother's nostril, like it was being born backwards. The mother snorted, hoping to push her baby back out. That's not my baby, she said, after each huff. That's not it either. The husband woke from one of his naps, hungry. He looked up with a start -- accusing, what happened to the baby?
A young couple adored their baby 
who was enlanting and bubbly as babies go. 
One day while they were out drying fish 
in a nearby hut, a man came along and began singing. 
This young couple loved to dance 
as they were still newlyweds. They didn't 
notice the singer's feet were a wolf's paws 
tucked cleverly inside his snow shoes. 
The wolf-man put the couple in a trance, 
as his wolf-wife stole their fat brown baby. 
The couple spent days following wolf tracks 
after they'd found wolf hairs in the baby's bedding. 
When they finally found the den, 
they burst in with arrows. They successfully 
killed the thieves without noticing their baby 
hidden under the she-wolf. Their arrows 
went right through the baby's heart. 
The man and woman fought over whose fault it was 
and never again danced in each other's arms.
Atungaq and his wife set out to travel around the world 
with no idea how big the world really was. 
Atungaq imagined it would take a year, at most, on foot. 
They took their two children, a young girl and an infant. 
Their first stop was the village of The Laced Ones, a jolly people 
who held their garments together with caribou sinew. 
They came upon The Dwarfs, then a village of Lopsided People, 
each with only one hipbone, whose kayaks easily capsized. 
It was not until they reached The Clawed Ones 
that they ran into danger. Their older daughter 
was stopped on her way to get firewood by a woman 
whose nails were as big as the daws of a snowy owl. 
The woman scratched the girl to death and ate her, 
her poor heart bouncing on the floor, 
trying to reach her father. Atungaq fled with his wife 
and baby to the land of the Ones Who Make Mistakes. 
Here their baby was taken away by a woman 
who took a needle to his fontanel and sucked out 
all his young blood. Atungaq and his wife fled again, 
and made it home, heartbroken to have lost their children, 
but bragging they'd survived the dangers of the world 
when they'd only really survived the dangers of the pole.
If you eat intestines during your pregnancy, your child will turn into a worm. 
Even though she knew this, this mother-to-be was craving reindeer 
jejunum, duodenum, and ileum. And besides, there was not much else to eat. 
She said her prayers, hoping for the best, forgetting her forbidden meal 
in a few months, when she had no signs of ill health. 
Her baby was big, her delivery anything but easy. 
"Fly out like a sledge over smooth ice," coaxed the midwife 
and the child finally emerged. The new mother obeyed all the other taboos. 
She covered her head, and sat in the dark for eight days. 
She rubbed every bite of food she wanted to eat 
across the lips of her child first. Even so, 
the child grew thinner and more transparent. 
He played by making coils out of his own body. 
His mother begged him to stop, to eat some meat, 
but soon the worm-child slithered away, never to be seen again. 
A gang of brothers wouldn't let their only sister marry. 
They wanted her around to mend mukluks 
and dry the fish they caught. The sister became pregnant 
though she had no official husband
and feared what would happen if her brothers found out.  
She took the baby outside of her before it was ready, 
but not soon enough so that it would be nothing but blood. 
The discarded infant paddled away in a boat he made 
from the skull of the dog. He used a human arm bone for a paddle. 
The sister never knew this, that her baby came to visit 
and suck her breasts while she was sleeping. 
One by one her brothers died mysterious deaths. 
The baby used its powers -- he only wanted his mother back. 
The sister consulted a shaman, 
telling him that what she brought forth was no real baby, 
but that maybe it had something to do with her dead brothers. 
The baby finally heard the truth, and understood 
he wasn't ready for this world. He was born a little while later 
to another mother who had no selfish brothers.
It's hard for a starving mother to give birth, 
and a miracle that this one did at all. 
To have the energy to push, to have the strength 
to keep her knees up and her legs in a vee. 
There was nothing to feed her new baby -- 
no prospect of food for months, 
the breathing holes for catching seals 
all covered up by blizzards. The mother ate 
her baby to keep herself alive. 
The act was quick, stronger than an instinct. 
We could not blame her 
though we knew it was a mistake 
that she did not go to the Land of the Dead 
with her child. For then the childless mother 
was paralyzed. Frozen in one position forever. 
It was as though she had eaten her very own hand.
Chief Oohmehk decided to have a big feast 
because this was the first time in a long time 
a hunt had brought home so much food -- 
seals, belugas, ugruks, and caribous. 
For three days, everyone danced and ate. 
Everyone except one baby. His mother 
was so busy making ice cream, feeding 
her other children and her husband 
and her widowed mother-in-law, 
that when she fell asleep, her baby's stomach was empty. 
During the night, the baby sucked 
at his mother's breasts, first the right 
then the left, the slit of his mouth growmg 
until the tips of his lips reached his ears. In one instant, 
he sprouted teeth sharper than a wolf's 
and the milk wasn't enough. 
He started eating his mother's breasts. 
The baby's grandmother heard -- and then 
the husband and the other children -- 
a slurping and crunching, an obscene chewing. 
They saw the baby devouring his mother's neck, 
her shoulders and her thighs. The father 
and mother-in-law jumped through the skylight, 
the other children not far behind. 
Their screams woke the whole village, 
and everyone fled, Chief Oohmehk 
leaving his prized jade knife behind. 
The baby, not satisfied with the mere flesh 
of his mother, jumped after his people, 
and in the spring of his hopping, 
lost his diaper. His shrill cries 
woke the people of his village 
who escaped by crossing the lagoon 
on logs. When the baby tried to cross after them 
a brave young girl rolled the tree stump 
under his step and, with a splash, 
the baby disappeared. Just then 
a head of beautiful black hair 
rose to the surface. It was the lady 
with the fish body. She told Chief Oohmehk 
she would care for this hungry baby 
but that no one could cross the water 
back to the village. In time, 
people forgot the horror and tried to go home 
to fetch a lamp or a favorite rug. All were swallowed up 
in the black muck of the water -- which was empty 
and harmless, so it seemed, on the surface, 
a soup stock without any meat.
In the end it was hauling the snow that got to him. 
This orphan lived with his grandparents 
who bossed him around, in crankier and crankier tones 
as they all grew older. Their igloo 
was by the sea where the water was too salty to drink. 
So the orphan had to lug soft snow from a faraway hill. 
There were other chores, and, of course, the spankings. 
There was his guilt of putting a strain on his grandparents. 
And the rage -- his own parents gone. 
He couldn't even remember them. 
One day as his grandfather scolded the orphan 
about something small, and the grandmother 
ranted about a forgotten chore, the orphan 
began to sing. It was a song he always knew 
but hesitated to use. He ran to open the skylight 
and tear the bearded seal guts from the window. 
The orphan's magic song made snow, just as real and cold 
as the one that fell from the sky. The faster his words 
the stormier the weather. The igloo 
was filling up like a bowl. The grandparents 
couldn't move fast enough and were buried alive 
by what they always wanted the most.
It was a terrible time of starvation. 
The village decided to migrate, leaving the weak ones behind. 
One was a baby girl. Her mother cried, 
leaving her wrapped up in her own parka. 
When the village people found food, they returned to feed 
their abandoned relatives. The mother longed 
to see her baby alive in the warm jacket fleece, 
but tried not to have high hopes. So she was 
shocked to see her baby, still toothless 
and whining, bound out of the snow hut, 
bigger than a giant. The mother's parka was a small scarf 
around the giant baby's neck. The giant baby 
was so strong she could walk bare oot 
in the snow, her naked skin unchafed by the wind. 
The mother screamed. The whole village 
ran away, this giant baby 
running after them, drooling icicles. 
When the baby grew tired, she began to crawl. 
Those of the village moved so fast 
that when they looked behind them 
the giant baby was just a dot.
Every once in a while you'll see him: 
the spirit full of tattoos. You'll know it is him 
because of the vulva on his chin. 
His cheeks are two big breasts, nipples 
like pimples. Two little legs stick out of his neck. 
Sometimes he appears in the trash 
because he doesn't want the hungry to get even the scraps.
Daughters can move to faraway villages. 
When this happens, sometimes mothers cry 
and lose weight. Sometimes their faces turn gray 
and they sew more slowly. An old woman 
who missed her daughter had a solution. 
She named her dog the same name as her daughter. 
When she fed him she pretended 
she was feeding her child. When she called her dog, 
she called the girl, until sure enough 
the daughter heard her through the miles 
that separated them and came to visit.
He didn't live anywhere near his settlement, 
his tiny igloo too small to stand up in, 
impossible to lie down. Tiligvak 
was a simple man with extraordinary powers. 
During a bad winter he summoned 
a seal from the floor of the central snow hut. 
The seals had loved him ever since his first catch 
when he took off both his inner and outer jacket 
and rubbed his skin against the mammal's with love. 
The people of the village praised Tiligvak 
though they often gossiped about his strange hermit ways. 
At least until the day he fed his whole settlement 
with a bite of meat, a few tongues, 
and a small helping of marrow. 
He put the scraps on his magic seal skin plate 
and sang a song until the meat overflowed. 
Not even this bunch of his hungry neighbors 
could finish such a feast, Tifigvak's magic plate 
a piece of seal skin his people had foolishly thrown away.
This is what they called the day 
her first blood came, the day she was too old 
for her long slender doll made of reindeer bone. 
It had taken a long time for her to learn 
how to sew seal intestines without tearing them, 
how to guide the ulu 
so no part of an animal's hide was wasted. 
She'd given her bone doll a wolverine ruff 
because breath would not freeze 
on that kind of fur. Though her father 
carved her a doll with no arms, 
she'd made parka sleeves from the seamless skin 
of a ground squirrel's front legs. 
She'd crimped the doll's moccasins with her teeth, 
double checked each stitch to make sure 
no wind or ice could pass through it. 
An ill-sewn garment could mean death. 
An ill-made marriage could mean unhappiness. 
Her dolls' outfits were perfect as her mother 
packed them away. The sticky blood, 
slow and strange between her legs. She grew 
dizzy as her family began to talk 
of husbands and babies. She was an animal 
strung upside-down, drained before drying. 
Her hands never to touch skins that small again.
The dance house went dark 
when a wind blew out all the lamps. 
The singing continued in the blackness 
while a boy raped a young girl. 
He ran away just before the lamps 
were re-lit, and the girl, crying, 
made her way home on the crunchy snow. 
She was a girl who loved to dance 
and didn't want this pleasure taken from her, 
so the next night she returned to the dance house 
with soot on her hands, so that if this violence 
happened again, she'd dirty 
her attacker's back. After the second time -- 
the terrifying darkness, the pain, the rekindle -- 
the girl saw tier palm prints on her brother's parka. 
She cried, "Such things are unheard of!" 
Her body still felt the ache of his presence 
as she took a sharp knife and cut off both her breasts. 
She flung them into his hands, screaming, 
"You seem to have a taste for my body -- Eat these!" 
He held her bleeding breasts, in shock. 
She grabbed a torch and fled the dance house. 
No one is sure if the brother meant to apologize 
or simply attack his sister again, when he followed, 
stumbling and falling, snow putting out the flames 
of his torch so that only its embers flickered. 
A wind, more colossal than the one that disturbed 
the dance hall lamps, lifted the man 
and his breastless sister up high into the sky. 
The girl became the sun who does all she can 
to alleviate the dangers of the dark. 
She stays as far away as possible 
from her brother, the cold dim moon.
There was a woman who refused to marry. 
She lived with her parents, who always told suitors 
the decision to wed belonged to their daughter. 
One day in winter an old shaman sought her. 
She refused his proposal with a loud 
"Naami, no!" He blamed her rejection 
on his sagging skin and white beard. 
This usually kind man took his revenge. 
The shaman used his magic 
to follow the girl everywhere. 
He would stand in the entrance passage 
of each igloo she visited. 
To get away from him, she ran 
from one hut to another, but he always beat her 
to her destination. He said nothing, 
just smiled, not a nice smile, 
but a prideful one that showed his satisfaction
of winning. After many days of this, 
the girl began to stay home, 
the whiteness all around leaving her 
no place to hide. Although the shaman 
could do anything -- like make himself young and handsome -- 
he chose to age the girl in her sleep. 
One night, all her front teeth 
fell out on her pillow, her hair turned gray, 
and the whites of her eyes yellowed. 
The parents wept for their daughter, the crone-virgin, 
and hoped she wouldn't die 
before them. For several days, the shaman let the girl live 
as an old woman, knowing aching joints 
and palsied hands. When he finally came to her igloo 
she couldn't even stand. 
The girl who was an old woman 
sat at the edge of her cot 
as the shaman caused a seal to pass through her. 
The slippery mammal tickled her vagina 
without the usual pain of birth. 
Her hair slowly turned back to black 
and the flesh that hung in every direction 
tightened once again to her bones. 
"Well?" said the shaman. The young girl yelped 
as her teeth returned through her gums all at once. 
She followed the shaman out of the hut, 
her powerless parents holding each other. 
The wedding was little more than a rape, an intrusion 
through the most delicate passage way. 
The young girl said, "For some, there is no freedom."
This murderer of wives thought he had an excuse. 
On the day he was born, his father was killed 
by a group of evil spirits who drilled holes in his knees 
and sucked out all his juices. This murderer's mother 
vowed to make her son strong, pulling on his knuckles. 
The boy grew up triple-speed, rowing a kayak at two. 
At three, he killed his first seal. Soon he was hitting his head 
against the wall of his igloo because he needed a wife. 
When his mother told him he was still a child, 
the boy cried out that he was a man, too. 
The mother could not stand to see her son suffer 
so they began a journey to find a suitable woman. 
First, they tried the village of the Dog-Heads. 
This son was desperate. He picked a woman 
with not a bad-looking body. Their first night together 
this Dog-Headed woman tried to eat the boy's genitals. 
He killed her, and told his mother they would have to search further. 
In the next village, all the woman were taken but one 
and she had fingernails longer than a harpoon. 
Their first night in bed, she scraped the boy's back 
bragging that in this way she had made skeletons 
out of many men. Afraid for his fife, the boy killed her, too. 
The murderer's mother was too old and feeble to continue. 
She walked off a cliff, leaving the boy on his own. 
The third wife came from a village where women were abundant. 
She had blue-black hair and could clean a seal. 
Her hands were nice and fat. 
This seemed to be the love of the murderer's life 
until he realized she was barren. Fed up, he threw her 
into the sea. The rest of the village was furious. 
For this was not a place where killing women was acceptable. 
As punishment, the murderer had to marry 
a woman no one else would take. 
She never said a word. She knew nothing of mending 
sealskin boots. Her eyes were covered by a dull glaze. 
She didn't have any stories to tell. 
The murderer finally repented, crying on the graves 
of his former wives, stretching the knuckles 
on his enormous hands. He was still young, 
with many more years to live.
There was a husband who was more than a little ill-tempered. 
Though he didn't beat his wife, he tended 
to be too demanding for her tastes. Besides that, 
he wasn't a very good hunter. The wife watched 
as the other men in her neighborhood dragged home 
yummy seals. She waited for her husband 
who inevitably arrived empty-handed. 
He always walked into the igloo without a hello, 
wanting her to get him a drink of water. 
She said she wouldn't give him a sip 
until he brought home some meat. 
She was tired of taking handouts from the other hunters. 
She said things that she shouldn't have said, 
things that made him feel less of a man. 
One night after one of their fights, when she still 
refused to quench her husband's thirst, 
he said, "I'm fed up! No water? No husband." 
He walked out of the hut, vowing to never come back. 
On his walk the hunter with bad luck 
came upon a house where three magical bears lived. 
He told them his troubles, his head in their furry laps. 
He stayed among the bears, learning their secrets, 
until he missed his wife. Not one for fancy apologies, 
he walked through the igloo door saying, 
"Am I thirsty! How about a drink?" 
His wife thought at first it was some kind of joke. 
But when she didn't see her husband smile, 
she said, "Still no seal? Then no water!" 
The husband stared at the bearskin on the sleeping cot 
sending messages to the bears, just as they'd taught him. 
The loud paws of large bears could be heard 
circling the hut. A furry foot crashed through 
the ice-window of their igloo. "Here is your water," 
cooed the wife, calling her husband darling 
for the first time in a very long while.
This liar would do anything to get out of hunting, 
even trample his kayak, and put ice in his clothes, 
then hammer his own testicles with a stone. 
This is the trouble a liar will go to 
when he wants his wife to believe he's been victim of an iceberg. 

This liar would do anything to get out of hunting. 
When he heard of a child's death, he went to her parents to say 
he had a daughter by the same name. The grieving parents 
wanted their daughter's soul to go into the liar's child's 
so they gave him food and her pearls, a cooking pot. 

The liar was rich until the mourning family learned 
the liar had no child at all. They demanded he give the food back. 
They demanded he apologize to the spirit of their dead daughter. 
The liar couldn't sleep at night, the lies in his head 
crawling over one another like so many lice. 

His wife was ashamed. His friend had had enough of him 
when he claimed he caught a whale that turned out to be a stone. 
He led one faulty expedition after another. 
Any number of people could have been the one who killed him, 
down beyond the cliff where that dead whale should have been.
There once was a man so lazy 
he swallowed his bites of food almost whole 
rather than take the extra energy to chew. 
When he saw a blurry commotion 
through the ice-window of his snow-hut, 
he guessed at what was happening 
rather than rise from his cot 
to get a better look. He was happiest 
sleeping, drips of spittle freezing 
in the comers of his lips. 
He resented any kind of work. 
His job was to go out to the land 
to scare the caribou, chase them 
towards the crossing place 
where his fellow hunters waited 
with their kayaks. This was 
a hard enough job for a peppy Turnit, 
but for the lazy Turnit 
it was near impossible. Instead 
he spent his days resting in the snow, 
alert at first, afraid that he would be caught, 
then dozing when he closed his eyes to the sun. 
To satisfy his wife, the lazy man 
situated himself by a large stone. 
While he was still lying down 
he rested his feet against the rock 
and rubbed them back and forth. 
He often gave his shoes to his wife to re-sole 
until she ran out of caribou skins. 
It had been a long time since the hunters 
had a catch, but the wife didn't complain 
because, from the looks of his shabby shoes, 
the husband had tried so hard. 
When his fellow hunters got hungry enough, 
they decided to spy on their lazy friend. 
Sure enough, they found him lying down, 
shuffling in place on the stone. 
They watched the lazy man who had learned 
to walk and walk, to save time, in his sleep. 
They watched him walk to nowhere all day, 
then limp home, hoping for something to eat.
This raven, when he looked into the eyes of humans, 
felt a grumble in his stomach as big as an avalanche. 
He would start to salivate, the tender brown eyes 
of men and women, girls and boys, moist and succulent 
as the wettest of grasses. It was hard to catch the eyes 
of live humans, with their lids shutting 
like igloos, their arms flailing, throwing off his pecking. 
So this ravenous raven devised a plan. 
He told the pretty-eyed people of a large settlement 
to come down near the sea to greet a group of guests. 
The lonely people were excited and started 
in the direction the raven advised. 
As soon as the humans were under a summit, 
the raven began to dance on the enormous overhang of snow, 
which broke off in chunks bigger than snow huts. 
The whole settlement was buried in a matter of seconds. 
The raven had to wait until spring. To him, the melting snow 
was as beautiful as a slow-cooking fire. 
When it was warm, he emptied the human's eye sockets, 
his beak delicately spooning egg yolks from egg cups.
She wasn't a giant. And no, her vagina 
didn't have teeth. Instead it was like a hollow snake 
able to swallow whole big things. 
This woman's vagina didn't lead, like others, 
to a womb. Instead its slippery path 
pulled men like metal right to her magnet stomach. 
There, the men churned with blubber and seal meat 
she'd recently eaten. Other women looked for the remnants 
of their missing husbands in the shit 
of Her-Whose-Vagina-Ate-Men. Sometimes, 
a gold tooth, an unmistakable button. 
Widows didn't cry much. They knew 
a stray husband was worth less than a dog -- 
which wives could at least have for supper 
if they grew hungry enough.
Petrel was altricial, 
born helpless, with closed eyes. 
He lived high on the cliffs 
where he was safe. The Kittiwakes 
and Razorbills built their nests 
halfway up or on the ground. 
With thick coats of natal down, 
they were getting their own food 
before Petrel could even fly. 

In a snow-hut near by, 
Sedna stood, her head in the tropics, 
her waist in a temperate zone. 
Her feet were cold. Such was the nature 
of the igloo in which she lived -- animal skins 
lining the walls, the nostril hole 
in the roof, letting out bad air. 
Sedna was proud, refusing the suitors 
who came to court her. 

After Petrel had been a long time pampered, 
he turned himself into a man, 
knowing no mere bird was a worthy wife. 
He wore a handsome parka 
and spectacles made from walrus tusks 
to disguise his beady eyes, 
the only part of him that didn't easily transform. 
He was able to coax Sedna away from her home 
with his songs, his voice still sweet as a bird's. 

Sedna was happy until Petrel's glasses fell off, 
and the trance was broken. 
She looked at the nest in which she'd been living 
and shrieked. She jumped into her father's boat 
that had long been searching for her. 
Petrel swooped down towards the sea, 
flapping his wings, making waves. 
Sedna's fathers and brothers pushed her 
from the boat, afraid of the powerful spirits. 

Blue with cold, Sedna came to the surface, 
grabbing at the side of the kayak, her fingers 
turning to ice. Her brothers 
hit at her hands with a paddle. 
Her fingertips broke off 
and turned into sea lions. Sedna. tried once more 
to save her life -- her second joints split away 
and became ground seals. The next time 
her third joints became walruses 

and her thumbs sprang into whales. 
A great wave drowned Sedna's family. 
Petrel's cry woke the Kittiwakes 
and Razorbills. Sedna became a powerful spirit -- 
living as low as Petrel did high -- sending winds 
and wrecking kayaks. When she is happy 
she leads seals to hunters. Without fingers, 
she can no longer plait her own braids, 
each as thick as an arm.
This woman had no children but she had a unipkaaq
a story better than a pop-up book, better than a spell. 
She'd never told her husband since everyone knows 
you can never trust a man to keep a secret. 
One long night her husband begged for a story 
as though he were the baby she'd never had. 
She had told all the stories she could, 
the ones that didn't move lamps or stir up spirits. 
Her husband grew bored, saying: not that one, not that one 
again. Finally, the woman said she would tell of her magic 
if he promised not to tell the men in the qa1gi.
It was dangerous for a woman whose powers were known 
because the men who were visionaries outnumbered her. 
The woman sat in the middle of their igloo 
stirring her hand sun-wise, until her husband 
heard splashing water, until her husband 
saw water rising on their floor, and finally 
a whale. The wife asked for reassurance 
from her husband who was shaking. He promised 
not to tell as they ate pieces of whale skin 
and blubber. The next day the man went to work 
with a piece of whale meat in his cheek. 
He was chewing silently when his friends noticed 
he was eating something freshly caught. 
Through a series of badgering questions, the man confessed. 
His friends demanded he bring his wife to the qa1gi.
The exposed woman had no choice: 
the next day she repeated her story 
while she directed her husband to stay up by the igloo's skylight. 
The stirring, the water, and finally the whale. 
But this time the woman didn't end her story 
until her husband pulled her through the nose of the igloo 
and the qa1gi was flooded, all the men drowned. 
Shamans north and south of Tikigaq began to visit 
in the form of duck's down or caribou hair. 
As they filtered in through her igloo's nose, 
she always recognized them, 
transformed them back into their real selves, 
and chopped off their heads. When enough 
of the neighboring shamans were dead, war parties 
came into Tikiga Th woman felt sad 
about the death at secrets can cause, and she didn't have time 
to blame her husband. Instead, as the warriors 
approached the village, she stretched out her arms in front of her 
and rubbed the white undersides against each other 
until they were raw. The earth opened 
and the warriors went toppling in, 
never to bother Tikigaq again.
She was her only granddaughter -- tall, beautiful, big 
for her age. On her way home one night, 
the granddaughter was dragged into the men's recreation hut 
where each of the boys inside used her. 
She crawled home all bloody. 
The grandmother plotted her revenge. 
When at last the girl slept, the grandmother returned to the hut 
with her magic. She crawled like her granddaughter 
and put her fingers in her mouth. The bare-chested boys laughed -- 
they were hot after all that raping. But the grandmother 
put the boys in a trance so that they began following her, 
out of the hut and, on all fours, into the snow. 
She took them by the river where ice formed in their hair. 
She took them by a rarely used trail where their arms turned blue. 
Most died on the way to the mountain. When all the boys were frozen 
the grandmother ran home to her granddaughter. 
The girl rested and woke up feeling safe -- 
her dream of huge evil babies chilled forever into place.
I was left alone with only grandmother, 
as the youngest and oldest of our village, prohibited 
from the narwhal hunt. No one came back 
for years, not mother nor father, not the girls nor boys 
who I imagine would by now kiss my cheeks 
with snowballs, if they were still here. 
Luckily for me, my grandmother was magic. 
With a few words and a trance, she could turn herself 
into a man. Her seal-bone penis 
was always full of pleasure, her blubber-balls 
were always warm. And being a man, she was able 
to get food without as much danger. Her vagina 
transformed into a mighty sled. She created 
a team of dogs from her own lice. I spent my days 
hidden in the hut, sewing animal skins and singing. 
Grandmother always returned by evening, 
sometimes with a ptarmigan, his dead feathered feet 
stiff in the cold. I learned how to cook 
all kinds of soup. This went on for many days of dark 
and light, many years and changes in my body. 
Sometimes I feared my handsome grandmother's death 
and wondered if I'd be able to hunt for myself. 
How could I sleep without her curled into me? 
It came to pass that I would have other worries. 
One day when I was alone a man came to our house. 
His penis was real skin and blood. He showed me 
his wrinkled testicles with pride. He wanted to know 
whose harpoon stood in the corner. Whose kayak 
leaned against the wall. Whose child filled my belly. 
I told him they all belonged to my grandmother, 
my husband. I kicked as he threw me over his shoulder, 
promising he would make me a happier wife. 
Grandmother returned that evening as usual, 
a walrus roped onto her sled. She cried out my name 
over and over, looking for boiling water, some proof 
that I was coming back. She saw no point 
in hunting or eating anything else. She saw no point 
in being a man any more. She undid 
her magic spell -- man or woman, it's all the same 
when a person dies alone.
She once had a cushioned womb, 
a zestful kitchen, necklaces that dangled 
feathers and beads. Her daughter 
was just a baby then, crying for milk, 
not the only one left to take care of her mother. 

The old woman was blind now 
and crippled, often ill-tempered. 
The daughter would have preferred 
to wait on a husband or children 
so one day when the mother asked for water 

the fed-up girl handed her a bowl of urine. 
The old woman drank, pretending 
she did not know the difference. Her daughter 
did not have a pretty smile or eyes 
that sparkled. The mother who pitied her child 

said, "Which would you prefer as a lover, a louse 
or a sea scorpion?" The daughter no man would have 
chose the creature from the ocean, 
fearing she'd roll over and crush 
a tiny louse-husband in her sleep. 

The old woman knew she had lived too long 
and began pulling sea scorpions, one 
after the other, from her vagina, 
until her daughter was surrounded by suitors, 
until the old woman fell over dead.
This old woman was left behind 
because she didn't even have the strength 
to sit in her comer and chew hides for boots. 

When it was time for her village to move, 
her family said goodbye, giving her only a few insects to eat. 
The old woman accepted her death, thinking, 

I'm not going to eat these creatures. I am old 
and perhaps they are young. Perhaps 
some of these lice are even children.

When she hadn't eaten for a few days 
a fox slunk into her igloo. She prepared herself 
for the Land of the Dead as the fox bared his teeth. 

But instead of eating the old woman, 
he simply bit off her clothes, then her skin -- 
so gently she didn't even feel it. 

Her old skin lay around her ankles like a pair of trousers 
and when she looked down her new skin was firm, 
like that of a young woman. 

The insects, used to being eaten by humans 
who didn't think twice about it, 
had asked their fox friend to lend his magic. 

When the family returned next summer, 
they looked everywhere for the woman's bones -- 
under piles of rocks, in her favorite cave. 

They didn't know she'd gone off to five with the insects. 
It is said she married a handsome blow-fly 
who stayed by her side, forever faithful.
The woman with two vaginas tried her best 
to hide them from her husband. It was difficult 
because her vaginas weren't in the usual place 

but in the palms of her hands. To distract her husband, 
she tickled his penis with her nipple, 
or she took him into her backside. 

She had traveled far, from a place she preferred 
not to talk about, and her husband assumed 
she learned her sexual practices there. He was happy 

until he discovered his wife 
pissing through her fingers, as though she were trying 
to cup running water. He wished 

that he didn't know what he then knew -- 
that his sexy young wife was also a ghost. 
This was no time for sentimental lust -- 

a ghost can only bring loneliness to a snow hut. 
So he strapped his wife into his kayak 
and deposited her on an ice-floe far from home. 

He told her to go back to the Land of the Dead, 
but she was trapped like a moving shadow 
that was neither here nor there. Some say 

they still hear her sobbing: "My husband 
will not have me! My husband will not have me!" 
But she has no way of knowing how he misses her 

twin vaginas, how he tries his best to 
hide it from his new wife -- yet the village is small, 
the gossip as fast as wind during a storm. 

It's said he makes his new wife slap his face, 
to feel the warm tingle of her fingers, 
that he then cries out into her barren palms.
The father was more than surprised to see his dead daughter 
looking for fish on the drying rack. "Where have you been?" 
he asked, sneaking up on her and grabbing her by the waist. 
I have been in a beautiful place, a long way off," 
she said, telling her father she had to go back. 
He pleaded with her and called to his wife. 
The parents cried until their dead daughter consented to stay. 
This ghost of a daughter only meant to find the fish 
she left behind, then leave. She was unhappy 
in the snow hut, lonesome for where she had been. 
Sometimes her parents saw right through her 
and to the wall. Their daughter sulked, faded in and out. 
The mother and father bought her to the potlach,
proud to have their daughter back. People snubbed the girl, 
afraid, remembering her funeral. Someone 
introduced her to the five-year-old who had taken her name. 
Their shared soul split as the child let out a mighty scream. 
The dead girl disappeared, a raindrop in soft snow.
This poor boy lost his mother to the powerful tides, 
and then his father. His sister took care of him for a while, 
but she soon drowned, too. Left alone 
this boy had little strength in his legs or his loins. 
He was forbidden from the hunts. 
Women mocked him. Children giggled 
behind his back. His only friends were the ghosts 
who came to visit when all the others were away. 
They wrestled and told stories, and included 
the frail boy in their fun. His dead sister was the ghost 
who gave the boy a choice: Tell nothing about our visits 
and you will grow stronger. Tell about us 
and you will lose the little vigor you have.
The boy chose to tell about the ghosts 
and the villagers laughed at his expense. 
With each detail of his story, the boy grew weaker, 
until he was ready to be taken by the ghosts themselves. 
In the Land of the Dead he became a beautiful woman, 
one of the ghosts who didn't bother traveling back to earth to help.
She found his dead wives buried in the back. So this was the man 
who destroyed everything he loved. He was her second husband, 
her first so jealous that he locked her in the igloo, with a circle of sticks 
around her so she couldn't move. She wasn't sure what to do -- 
her son was constantly crying for food. She was a long way from home. 
At night she watched her second husband shave wood with his flint 
Until now she was able to avoid his touch, so as not to end up like 
his former wives. His penis-blade glistened as her second husband came 
near her, his eyes swollen with tears. She smiled and coaxed him to their 
cot, then using all her strength shoved him high into the air. 
The flint point of his penis stuck into the very same wooden bed frame 
it had made. The woman, both lucky and not, strapped her baby onto her 
back and ran towards home, through days of darkness. Magic women 
blew their breath into the baby's mouth so she didn't have to 
carry him anymore -- fast and strong, he could run by her side.
I couldn't believe what I saw. 
My big hooded seal, dead on the snow, 
enough food to let me stay home for a while. 
I snuck to the back of the hut to surprise my pretty wife 
who hadn't seen me for days. I saw instead my mother 
with her shirt open, moving her breasts up and down. 
She was singing, "Sleep with me, my dear little wife." 
The women I loved giggled together. My wife 
was the female, my mother the man, 
with a sealbone penis strapped to her waist. 
I had to punish my mother. I struck her so hard 
that I killed her. I urged my wife 
to come with me and leave our hut, that my mother 
had placed a curse on it. My mother 
was as dead as the seal I killed, blood spurting 
from her lip, the snow pink beneath her. 
My wife was in shock, crying, 
"You killed my dear husband." 
She wouldn't look at me for days. 
She wouldn't eat the seal meat. 
She wouldn't stop her crying.
In a village where all the men were killed, 
the women had no choice 
but to take their sons as husbands. 
As one mother strapped her newborn boy 
onto her back, he immediately grew into a man. 
He remained the size of an infant 
but had a stubbly chin and wise eyes. 
The woman carried him everywhere, 
over shallow streams where the water reaching 
over her ankles could easily wet his groin. 
She had to hold him while he peed, 
like a miniature airplane, over the ground. 
He was so light her back never tired, 
even though along with him she carried 
a supply of his arrows. The little husband 
was a wonderful hunter, able to sneak up 
on resting reindeer, his weight so slight 
he left no footprints. The woman rarely missed 
conventional sex, her little husband 
crawling over all over her body 
as though she were one giant breast.
When the big woman first came to the village, everyone thought 
she was a man. She went out on the hunts and bossed 
the rest of the party around. She could snap a live caribou's neck 
with her bare hands. Only one woman was nice to her. 
She gave her chunks of the meat she dried. 
She went to visit the big woman who lived alone in her igloo. 
The big woman never said thank you, only grunted 
when the other woman brought her a new parka. 
One night the big woman snuck into the kind woman's hut 
and crawled under the blankets right between her and her husband. 
"I need a man," she said. The wife tried not to get mad, 
but eventually elbowed the big woman out of the bed 
before the husband woke up. The next day the big woman 
wanted to fight. The kind woman who had little experience 
had no choice. The two women wrestled near a cliff. 
The big woman threw the smaller one into the air. 
There she met a bird spirit who would help her. 
The little woman landed back on earth with a thud. 
She felt a surge of power in her arms, 
then tossed the big woman into the ocean 
where her heaviness was no longer a problem where she 
lived as a whale who bebopped about and swam in peace. 
So even when she thought she was being mean to her big friend, 
the kind woman was still being kind.
So strong was Sermerssuaq 
she could lift a kayak 
on the tip of three fingers, kill 
a seal with her fists, rip a fox apart 
with bare teeth, beat the men 
at arm-wrestling. Sermerssuaq 
liked to show off 
her purple clitoris -- 
which grew so big when she was excited -- 
a hare's pelt 
could barely 
cover it.
He slept in the middle of the igloo, 
near the lamp, while each one of his two wives 
shivered near the wall. It wasn't fair -- 
the way he thrashed them when they giggled. 
The way he thrashed any man who paid either wife 
a compliment. The angry husband killed a villager 
when it was rumored he had slept 
with one of the wives. The two women 
made a pact to flee their husband 
and hiked to the coast in special mukluks 
they'd sewn for the trip. They made their new home 
inside the carcass of a whale who'd washed up 
on the beach. They crawled through his mouth, 
careful not to rip their shoes on his teeth, 
and rested against the walls of his belly. 
The whale's meat lasted them forever, 
his rotten insides as tasty as potent cheese. 
The husband consulted a shaman, 
who led him right towards the whale. 
But the husband feared the awful smell 
and returned to beat the shaman, 
rather than the wives 
who now slept in the warmth 
of each other, in the yellow glow 
of a blubber lamp they shared.
A giant woman ran in pursuit of a human man 
after he'd killed her husband with a giant ax. 
The human, not knowing what else to do, 
thrust the giant ax through the snow 
hoping to split the world in half -- 
his side for humans, the other for giants. 
He thrust with all his might 
but could not get his wish. 
All he managed to gouge out was a lake, 
which the thirsty giantess began to sip. 
The human encouraged her to drink more, 
taunted her by saying she'd have to finish the whole lake 
if she ever wanted to get to the other shore 
to kill him. The giantess drank to her fill, 
her bloated stomach extended like a full moon. 
The human laughed, reminded her how tasty 
his flesh would be on her tongue. She had been out for wood 
just so she could roast him, her husband 
capturing the human earlier in the day. Dead husband or not, 
wasn't she still hungry? The giantess grew dizzy, 
all that water ruining her equilibrium. 
She lumbered towards the human, 
lake water now only up to her hefty shins. 
Then suddenly, without warning, she burst, 
her insides flooding the landscape with mist. 
The human sat in the fog, waiting for it to dear. 
From then on, on certain mornings, fog would appear.
There once was a giant who loved to eat humans, 
especially their hearts. The people ate nothing 
but what they caught from the sea, and thought 
this giant was lazy, roaming the snow 
for such small food. After too many were killed, 
and the people feared soon none of them would be left, 
one smart man devised a way to murder the beast. 
He played dead on the giant's trail, and the giant 
tossed him over his shoulder, humming in anticipation 
of a good meal. The man let his head and arms drop, 
careful not to say ouch when he repeatedly bumped 
against the giant's back. He was tossed on the floor 
of the giant's hut, while the monster left 
to get firewood to roast him. The monster's son, 
smaller by comparison, came in. The man 
held the giant's heavy skinning knife to the son's throat, 
saying, "Quick, tell me. Where is your father's heart?" 
The anatomy of any giant is tricky -- brains sometimes 
in the belly, a stomach in an inner ear. "My father's heart 
is in his left heel," confessed the giant's son, whose own heart 
may have been in his upper arm. When the giant 
bounded through the door, the man was quick to stab him 
in his foot. The giant let out a thunderous cry, 
then fell over. He said, "Though I am dead, 
I'm going to keep on eating you and all other humans forever!" 
The man cut the giant's body into pieces and tossed them, one 
by one, into a fire he made with the wood 
the giant had gathered. When the man threw the ashes 
into the wind, each fleck transformed into a mosquito. 
From the middle of a buzzing cloud, the man could hear 
the giant's voice, "I'll eat your people until the end of time." 
The man felt a sting, then another, as though his whole body 
was a huge lip being pierced with women's jewelry, with labrets.
These tribes of men were never seen, 
except for their footprints and shadows, 
except for their snow huts and weapons. 
Seeing that there were no invisible women, 
these imperceptible men courted humans. 
Invisible men were said to be among the most handsome, 
but women could not be sure who they married 
until the unseen spouses died 
and then their faces became apparent. 
One human woman was so curious, 
she often stared into her invisible husband's shadow 
trying to guess the shape of his chin. 
When she held his body against hers at night, 
she memorized his outline. She tried to fill 
everything else in the next day when he was out hunting. 
She imagined the shapes of his hot breath in cold air 
were keys to the details of chest. 
She noticed the nuances of skin color among the villagers 
and tried to approximate his. When they kissed, 
she paid tribute to his invisible nose's width. 
One day when she could stand it no longer 
she stabbed a knife into the space 
where her husband was sleeping. 
His feet appeared first, then his legs, 
his torso, his arms, and finally his face 
which was more angelic than any wife 
could have imagined. Outside the hut 
bows were seen moving through the air 
as the other invisible men craved revenge. 
Because of their code of honor, invisible men 
could not aim arrows at those who could not see them. 
So instead they wailed along with the wife, 
voices even more invisible than usual, 
sobbing their disembodied grief.
The land of Island Ice was forbidden, 
yet three men journeyed there to hunt reindeer. 
So plentiful were the animals, these men 
built a little igloo and decided to stay for a visit. 
As they were sleeping the old spirit 
Aukjuk, the stealer of entrails, 
passed directly through their temporary ice wall. 
Dish in hand, she walked up to the first man 
and sucked out his entrails without waking him. 
She emptied the second and third hunter 
and left carrying her laden dish. 
The men were so light now, they rose to the sky 
and stopped at the moon. Even the powerful Moon Man 
was no match for Aukjuk. He sent the hollow men 
back to earth, to their wives 
who had to tie their husbands 
to their sleeping cots 
so they wouldn't float away.
A man can wander out by himself, 
far away from the others and, if he has 
enough room, grow into a giant. 
Dwarfs live in crowded places 
making tools so small human hands fumble 
when they try to use them. 
Then there are the half-people, 
those with whole heads and whole genitals, 
but with only one leg and one arm. 
They hop around, longing for the twins 
of themselves. They hop around like stripes 
peeled from the hides of majestic animals.
Back then, there was a mouse so big 
that when he stretched his morning stretch 
he was sure he touched the sky. It was soft and cool 
under his paws, not scratchy like his nest. 
He nibbled on his frozen fish and wished 
himself a better life. He wanted fame 
more than any other mouse. 
He constantly tried to prove himself. 
He swam the biggest lake, which took a whole day. 
But the other mice only laughed, pointing out 
the lake was a mere sloshy human footprint. 
It took him weeks to move a mountain 
that turned out to be just a rock 
that was only a few times larger than a pebble. 
Back then, mice as well as people said 
the sky was held up by a pole, like a table leg 
or an umbrella handle. The mouse thought 
he could shake things up, 
become the greatest mouse, 
by cutting down the pole and letting the sky drop 
on Kotzebue. Everyone would have to 
notice him then. So he chewed and chewed 
at the pole until his whiskers turned gray 
and his belly hung into the snow 
and finally one day the pole started to sway. 
The mouse pushed it and ran 
in the opposite direction. He lifted his paws 
over his head, ready for toppling clouds 
and stars. But nothing happened. 
On the ground all he saw was a leaf. 
He scampered along the length of the pole 
and found it nothing but a tree. 
So no one ever thought this mouse the greatest. 
He died in his sleep, obscure and nameless.
The shaman was not only murdered, but humiliated. 
Alluk cut off the tips of the shaman's fingers 
and took out his bladder and pitt it over his head like a cap. 
This happened on the mainland, before Alluk fled to King Island 
where he dressed like a woman, hiding from the shaman's friends. 
The shaman's spirit couldn't rest, with the thought of Alluk's spears 
right through him. The shaman tried to stay alive 
as long as possible and even had a pipe, the smoke coming out 
of his stab wounds. But soon even the shaman had to give in to death, 
though he did not travel all the way to that other world. 
Instead, he hovered above land until he found Alluk 
on King Island. His neighbors had not known his identity, 
knew nothing about his murdering a shaman. So they were surprised 
when they found Alluk tied up in a ball 
with stiff dry ropes no one could untangle. 
Alluk wept and called for his mother and father, 
anyone who could help him. And the shaman 
had his revenge -- Alluk curled up like a child in his death womb.
The glutton loved to eat so much 
that his huge belly was becoming a hindrance. 
He tried to tighten it with thongs 
so it wouldn't drag behind him, 
but the belly fat always found a way to pop out. 
He tried to stick his stomach in a hole in the ground. 
He tried to pack it in a snow drift before he left for a hunt. 
The smart belly always followed him, 
an embarrassment. It was time for magic. 
He commanded a mountain to be his new belly. 
He walked away unencumbered, proud 
that he had the biggest detachable stomach of all 
where he could store all that more food. 
Maybe the mountain started to feel resentful. 
Maybe it was a coincidence, an act of nature 
that, one day on his way to see how his stomach was doing, 
the glutton was killed by an avalanche.
The boy was eager to become a man, 
to please his grandmother who raised him. 
One day when the sea was calm, 
she asked him to walk along the beach 
to see if he was able to catch any fish. 
The boy walked in the wavelets, spotting 
first a tomcod. He grabbed it with two hands 
as the slippery fish danced in the air. 
The boy panicked -- he hadn't a sack 
in which to carry the fish. The tomcod 
didn't look as if it would stop wiggling 
any time soon. The resourceful boy 
made a decision, to swallow the fish 
whole and carry it home in his belly. 
He picked up a trout, a humpback, 
a whitefish and two salmon. 
Each left a ring of taste on the back of his throat. 
His belly began to bloat. Then he caught sight of a seal. 
He pulled off its whiskers before he swallowed. 
Then a beluga, a baby whale. 
Suddenly the boy's stomach was too big for walking. 
First, he tried lifting his gut and throwing it over his shoulder 
like a sack But soon his weight grew unbearable, 
especially after he stopped at a pond for a drink. 
The fish jerked back and forth, giving him cramps. 
The only way to go back was to follow the shoreline 
where his belly could float and bob in the sea. 
When he returned to his igloo he had grown too big 
to enter through the window or skylight. 
His grandmother used her magic 
to get him through a door. She sat him by the fire 
where a flying spark landed on his stomach. 
His skin was stretched so thin that this fiery ember burned right through 
and all the swallowed fish flew up and out with a gurgle. 
The grandmother laughed and thanked the gods, 
food for a whole winter swimming around her ankles.
Everyone knows shooting stars shoot nothing but shit. 
Yet Namik lacked all wisdom. 
He didn't wait for the star shower to stop 
before he began his hunt. The stars' droppings 
were like those of birds, except for their power -- 
The star shit turned Namik into grayish lichen forever. 
When igloos were alive 
and spun through the air, 
and snow burned in lamps 
because it could burn then, 
there was one more Eskimo word 
for snow. Snow in the air, 
drifting snow, snow on the ground, 
watery snow, newly fallen, 
drifted into house, suitable 
for building a house, crusty, 
hard, soft... There was a word then 
for snow that could burn. 
In this world of magic 
there was a girl who refused to marry -- 
her suitors good hunters, but dull. 
Her exasperated father finally married her 
to one of their dogs, and together 
they had ten children: two Eskimos; 
two dogs; two dogs 
with human heads; and four 
white boys. The white boys 
were warlike, biting her nipples 
as they nursed, crying through 
the night. The girl put her white children 
into the sole of a boot and set it adrift 
on the sea. The children were men 
by the time they reached white men's land 
where they settled down and produced 
all the white men now in the world.
White men aren't really white, 
if you consider snow as being white 
and the food in the sacks the white men hauled 
as being white. In Kivalina, white men 
abandoned a schooner. This is where 
the Inuits first found the flour 
which a widow first cooked with water and seal oil 
to feed her hungry children. 
The bread bubbled until it tanned 
like a white man, until it was as brown 
and delicious as her own hands.
Everyone makes too much of the moon. 
It is the same as here -- the same snow, 
the same animals. When it seems 
like there are too few caribou left 
I go to the moon to get a few more. 

Everyone makes too much of the sky. 
It's the same as here, tipped upside-down. 
When the wind blows it rustles the grass stems 
loosening snow which gives us snow storms. 
The lakes in the grass are our stars. 

The worst winters come when the giant up there 
needs another snow hut. The snow we get then 
are particles hurling from his shovel. 
He gets out of breath doing all that work. 
His huffing and puffing is the north wind.
Raven always takes credit for creation. 
But who knows for sure how he did it? 
Some say we all descend from the pea 
that Raven planted in sands of a barren beach. 
Imagine his surprise when a man 
split the door of his pod and walked out 
shading his eyes to the sun? 
Raven pushed up his beak 
like a baseball cap of his favorite team, 
and sure enough a human face lurked beneath. 
When three more pea-men rolled out of the pod, 
Raven decided to take them inland, 
leaving the first man on the coast. 
Others think this makes more sense -- 
that when Raven brought light to the world, 
a bladder parachuted down from the sky. 
Trapped inside were the first man and woman. 
They tore their way out and blew air into the bladder-aircraft 
until the first mountain popped up. 
The man scratched his head against the hills 
to create small animals. The woman urinated 
to produce the sea and spat 
to form rivers and lakes. A few say 
we were here all along, just underground -- 
our tunnel leading to the surface of the earth 
plugged up with a stick. When it finally cracked, 
men and women crawled out 
like so many curious slow-motion ants.

Our Eyes in the Middle
We Gather to Scatter
Even Fire Has Water Within It
To a girl fourteen in 19 10, 
no doctor could prepare, nor father 
console. Her mother couldn't really 
speak to her from heaven. 
No choice but to believe 
the gentle, kindly men. 
"Lie down here. Breathe this." 
She woke to an absence 
ever after present. One breast 
growing on alone, into, she must 
have felt, no chance of marriage. 
How could she speak of this 
to any man? How could she not? 
God and her father would love her.
God and her father would love her 
but how could she unbraid their voices? 
Father, in the pulpit, all her life 
the voice of God. To picture 
God: a fearsome, loving father. 
Then, a third strand, too -- 
the voice of her desire, stronger, clear. 
When the letter came, "You are needed 
in Alaska. Do you want to go?" 
the tangled voices stretched 
and all sang "Yes" together. 
Father said, remember, Jesus said 
"Lo, I am with you always, 
Even unto the end of the world."
"Even unto the end of the world" 
her father said, not knowing how close 
he was to death. When the letter 
came to her, by train, by boat, by dog-team, 
that first year, she sat alone, months 
since he was buried, she not knowing. 
Months before she knew her home 
was here, her love, her work. 
That world could have fractured then 
like spring ice, sent her floating 
off alone in freezing water, no land in sight. 
But people there were watchful, wanted her 
to stay. They reached, she held -- 
days, weeks, seasons, years.
Days, weeks, seasons, years of love and labor -- 
she remembered them to Maury, his love 
a gift she'd not had time to dream of. 
Out together, walking, taking pictures, 
a yellow flower would make her think of Shishmaref. 
"As soon as there were patches of dry ground 
we'd take our picnic out. One year, I made 
seventy-four doughnuts." Evenings, playing scrabble, 
she might put down "gangrene," tell about the man 
whose leg she'd saved, the beaded mukluks 
his wife made for her, to thank her. 
She'd show pictures. "This dog-team took us 
five hundred miles. Seal-pokes store the frozen berries." 
Maury smiled, touched her shoulder. Oh, my.
She smiled and touched his shoulder. "Oh, Maury 
listen. My niece went to Shishmaref, They made 
this tape..." Organ music filled two rooms. 
In one, the harmony of someone cooking hotcakes, 
dogs outside, a baby. She knew this time of year 
that sea was freezing into silence, while here 
she heard its liquid rhythm all year round 
softly breaking at the edges of this room. 
Maury's room. She could use his tape recorder 
any time she liked. "Listen to him play that organ. 
He must be as old as we are. I taught him how, 
and think of that, he still remembers." 
"There is a green hill far away," she hummed along, 
climbing to the top and gazing out.
Climbing to the top and gazing out 
from the mission to the freighter 
coming in each year, she never knew 
what it would bring. She knew what she 
had ordered and she liked to see that, stacked 
against the winter. Then, as the ship went out 
she sorted through the unexpected gifts -- 
coats and sweaters, stuffed toys, mittens. 
Once a furnace for the orphanage, 
radiators, pipes, and all the fittings. 
Sometimes something odd, you wouldret know 
what it was for, but someone always 
found a use for everything. So much 
thought and human goodness, so much love.
She thought of all the love and human goodness 
and about the question someone asked, 
"Did you ever think you might be interfering, 
destroying what you didn't understand?" Yes, 
she wondered about that sometimes. 
You do what seems right, 
but you never know. Maybe it was like the doctors 
doing the best they could to save 
her life, so long ago. Today, they wouldn't 
do that, they know more. But life refuses 
to be diminished by our limitations. 
It takes whatever we can give 
and gives back more. To all of us, as 
to a girl fourteen in 1910.
When the old woman greets you, 
her eyes sparkle, but she hides 
her hands, dirty from digging. 
Asked what she's found, she'll show you: 
an ivory comb, a harpoon's point, 
a mastodon tooth. Not much, 
but you should see 
what her son's daughter found! 

Later, you do: the jade axe head, 
cool green weight, sharp edge, 
stories. Holding it 
for a moment as it is passed 
around the room, you are included.
When I was six years old 
this doll curved to fit my hand, 
a girl my age with black hair, 
red lips embroidered on soft leather. 
Her parka would come off, 
but I was careful. She 
had come so far to sleep 
with me, the soft fur 
around her face against my face.
Emma is washing her family's socks, 
stopping to hold the school teacher's baby. 
"This baby always want to be held," 
she tells me. As we look out her window 
at the boats, coming from hunting, fishing, 
her tears enter our silence. Her children 
come in and out from school, 
forgotten homework, money for pop. 

We talk. Her husband enters the room we are in 
without breaking it. He is carving 
a fish from the rib of a whale, 
looks up to make the baby smile, tells me 
what he can do: fix snowmachines -- 
"Somebody had to know, that first winter 
they came here, so I learned." 
and what he can't do: read, write. 
"You might not have learned 
to fix snowmachines if you could read, " I offer. 
"But it makes you feel bad." 

He talks of dreams for his children 
as if it's all one dream: 
"They should learn enough in school 
to be a secretary. We should all go back 
to Ikpek and start the village again." 
Emma dreams that Jesus is coming back. 
"Pretty soon now. So many people have died. 
It used to be TB. Now it's that cancer." 

The fish emerges 
from the bone: swimming 
tail curved, head raised, 
the weight a fish would be 
if it could be held 
in motion.
I am leaving, and want to take something with me. 
Herbert wants to give me more than money can buy, 
because my name is Helen Frost, and I remind him of her. 

While he sells shrewdly 
to someone else, he watches me 
with the other side of eyes trained to see 
what someone wants more than anything. 

I touch the smooth ivory seals and white bears, 
the rough bone sculptures of motion: 
Eskimo dancer, face to the sky, 
feet solid on frozen ground. 
I touch the smooth faces 
of women, their parkas, 
babies between fur and skin. 
I touch the babies' 
ivory noses. Herbert is watching. 

"I want to show you 
something they found in the digging." 

He opens a safe in the corner, 
finds something small, well-wrapped. 
Unwrapped, in my hand, it shines 
golden, unchipped, not the gold 
of today's sun, too brilliant 
to stare at -- a gently aged ivory. 
The image has no hands, no hair. 
She has two eyes, a mouth, 
the rounded form of a child 
soon to be born, to glow 
in its own time, in our time. 

"Did the person who found her polish her up?" 
"No. She came out of the ground like this. 

I go back, through the image, 
through my father's sister 
who lived in this place and was loved, 
through the people who loved her, the parents 
who loved them ... the old village glows, and dies. 

The sea threatens. 
Sand buries the village. 
Ice buries the sand. 
In another winter, 
in a distant place, 
the smooth carved woman 
comes out of the ground 
like this: 
                  Hold me, she says 
                  and you will be blessed.
It used to be your hands 
I'd think of when my body was alone 
at night, or in the middle of a meal, 
wanting you to taste the bread 
I'd kneaded, baked. The smell 
of baking bread has filled the house 

like another person's pillow. What house 
do you live in now? My hands 
are so far from knowing your smell 
I don't even know where you live, alone 
pretending you like to slice bread, 
some cheese, maybe a few potatoes, and call that a meal. 

There is no such thing as a meal 
when one person lives in a house. 
"Give us this day our daily bread," 
we prayed when I was a child, hands 
folded, heads bowed. And now, those words alone 
bring to this room that familiar smell: 

diapers, split pea soup, the smell 
of parents in love with each other, each meal 
a feast of joy. They were never alone. 
They could move ten kids from one house 
to another. We'd hold up two hands 
to strangers' questioning glances. A loaf of bread 
might last one meal -- oatmeal bread 
our grandmother baked. That smell 
filled her house when her hands 
looked too tired to lift a meal 
to her mouth. She stayed in her house 
till she died. I never thought she was alone. 

But perhaps she was. Maybe alone 
is something that happens like air fills bread, 
warm air that will rise to the roof of a house 
and then out, carrying all that smell 
of love, fear of death, plans for the next meal. 
All this has led me far from your hands. 

It is like this that living alone in the hands 
of circumstance has led, one meal at a time, one house 
to another, too far to return. You don't smell this bread.
On the lake a swan moves, brilliant, then hidden 
in shadows, trees hanging over the edge of the lake's only island. 
Three girls watch me watch the swan, 
hear how I call it "he." We see him swim alone, 
white on the wide, deep lake. 

Elizabeth, sick last year, now better, 
looks down at her shirt 
where two small nipples show. She wants to know 
"What if one side grows more than the other?" 
I tell her the other side may catch up and if not 
it won't matter so much when they're larger. 
My breasts, round but innocent still of the hunger 
infants cry out from, cannot quiet 
their own hunger for tiny mouths. 

Emma has never told me why she was sobbing 
alone in a corner that rain-driven day. Today she asks 
"How can you keep your life from going wrong?" 
and we talk of lives we know, gone somehow wrong. 
I hold her question as I could not hold her. "What's wrong 
can lead to what's right. What seems right 
sometimes goes wrong. Don't blame anyone. 
Let's go swimming." 
We stay close to shore, shade our eyes to look for the swan. 

Mary has been accused (more than once) of seeing too much. 
She looks at me, looks at the shores which outline this lake, 
asks "Could you swim from here to that island?" 
"It looks hard, but yes, I think so." 
Evening, we all look together across the dark water, 
no swan in sight. "Shall I try?" 
I ask, and the girls answer "Yes." 

I step to deep water, swim easily 
across moonlight, straight to the island, 
into shadows of fallen branches, living trees, 
shadows the swan has moved through. I touch 
stones at the island's edge, stand, wave to the girls 
who wave back. Moon sends her wide beam down 
through cold air between us. 

Swimming back, I see the girls point but can!t hear what they shout. 
I swim hard, they wave harder, so I turn and see 
the swan, black, move across white. Beak hard, 
wings folded, he makes and holds the distance he wants 
between us. I know the strength of his wings, 
powerful webs of his feet. I hear the girls shout -- 
when I turn, they are not where they should be -- no -- I am not 
where I should be. A current is pulling me, harder than I can swim. 

The girls start to sing. I hold their voices, 
swim backwards against the current, away from the swan, 
now white against dark, beautiful eyes, muscular neck. I pull 
underwater, glide without splashing, pull as hard as I can, harder. 
Elizabeth, Emma and Mary keep singing. 
Their song pulls me back, until I can hear each voice 
distinct, the trio together, fire behind them behind me. 
The swan turns and I step out of the water, 
receive from the girls a towel, a blanket, hot soup. 
We are quiet. The swan swims back to shadows. 

We sleep and wake, sun warms us. 
I walk alone along the shore. That current, 
where is its source? 
Here, a channel where it flows away. 
Tall grasses wave, I move among them. 
When I find it, I know I've been seeking 
these grasses, feathers, mud -- this tumultuous circle, 
wider one side to the other than my arms could reach. 

A swan swims up the channel. She 
steps into her nest, arranges 
her wings beside her, 
settles to warm her egg or eggs. 
I sit on a sun-warm rock, watch until he comes home. 

When I return, I tell the girls what I have seen. 
Elizabeth has slept all afternoon, woken clear. 
She cups the egg she hears in her two hands. 
Emma has walked around the lake, dragging back 
a log for firewood, and now she rests upon it. 
Mary looks wide at the water, 
sees the swan swim near, gathers him into our circle. 
"Look at our eyes." she says. "our eyes are different."
About fifty miles he took her, from home 
because he wanted a woman, and she was young, 
beautiful, strong. They walked this land 
across the low-slung mountains, the only horizon 
she knew, and on into the darkening 
weather. Further, further. She kept her eyes open, 
remembering the shape of every tree. 

While she was there with him, her daughter 
came to the world. But the woman did not like 
the man she was with. She set her eyes 
on the mountain she had to cross, started 
walking, child on her back. She knew the rivers, 
ponds, the tracks beside them. No people 
had built their houses along the way. 

She heard sticks breaking behind her, not 
the sound of a charging moose, not a circle of wolves, 
not a lynx nor a wolverine. Her husband's brother 
followed her like a dark cloud she couldn't 
outrun. He cut her head with his knife 
and she fell there. She didn't see or hear 
when he turned and left her bleeding.

It was springtime. The sound of crying attracts 
the hungry ones, just coming out of their dens. 
The child was hungry too. Her mother lay there, barely 
breathing, unable to feed or quiet her daughter. 
But the animals left them alone. She found herself 
living. She knew where she was and she knew 
the steps she must take to get home. 

The child carried a seed of her own 
daughter, the woman who speaks to us now, 
whose son, grandchildren, great-grandchildren 
listen and know by their listening, her grandmother 
had to survive. We want her to stand, 
take the steps she must take, and she takes them, 
alone, and she carries us, and we pull her along.
When she is taken from them, her family 
holds her, in mind, those seasons. 

Bitter winter, they dream her a caribou blanket, 
pray the animals take it to her. 

Springtime, they need fish, they travel 
the river channel, put out their nets. 

Steadfast, they leave a stick 
pointing the way they have gone. 

Each day and evening, their ears are open. 
Slap of a beaver. Splash, a fish jumps. 

It is evening. There is a fire, beaver tail crackling. 
Her brother hunts the river's edge 

for muskrat's soft ripple. Someone 
is crying in the woods. 

He tells the others. They cross the river. 
They bring her back. 

Someone is feeding the child. 
Someone is making a mild broth. 

Someone is warming water. 
The water is warm, to wash her hair. 

The water is reddish brown. 
She sleeps, she sleeps, they care for the child.
This field in summer had always been 
rich with blueberries, hands to pick them. 
On one side, the church, graves. 
On the other, wetland, cranes. 
Far off, not to be gazed at, not to be named, 
the mountain. 

Then airplanes came, needing a place to land. 

The Cat rolled round metal toes 
through forests of living trees, 
forests of burned trees, around swamp, 
around lakes. It came to the people, 
four houses and the church. Children 
ran to watch the Cat roll 
over and over the berries, over and over, 
so airplanes could land, 
between the church and its mountain. 

They did land. 
They do land. They bring 
flour, sugar, coffee, diapers, tea, 
school, radio, Pilot Bread, doctors, 
money, Spam, batteries, blankets, 
boots, guns, telephones, teachers, 
apples, lettuce, priests, propane, 
beer, whiskey, fur buyers, frying pans, 
cigarettes, Blazo, snowmachines, 
game warden, teakettles, parkas, 
mattresses, band-aids, tv., potatoes, 
shampoo, Oil of Olay. Almost daily now 
the airplanes land. We meet them. 

The church holds its ground. 
A splash of berries edges the runway. 
This earth has eyes.
You are cold at night, 
your blood not moving so fast. 
Who am I? Dropped out of the sky 
one day, not carried back, can't speak 
any words of your world. 

I give you my hot water bottle, 
small container of warmth 
I was too far away to give 
when my own grandmothers 
faded back into their beds. 
You have seen plenty 
to cause you to wonder 
where my grandparents are. 

You take my gift 
in both hands. 
You shake it. 
You smile. Our eyes meet, 
blue eggs, brown nest.
I was neither hunter nor his wife 
nor mother, child, cousin. 
But with them, learning 
quiet as I could, 
what every child on the river 
knows as deep as breathing. 

Where beaver keeps his winter food. 
Whose blood this is, otter or the fish he ate. 
How long ago these tracks were left, how large 
they were to start with, how they spread 
and lose their shape, but keep their rhythm. 
How our sleep and waking moves with theirs. 

I relaxed against the boat -- strength of metal 
at my back, motor and its gas, men 
to guide the boat, watching woods and water. 
With the women, but without a child, 
I could watch the sky, blue, 
cloudless over yellow trees.. 

One eagle, high, 
spiraling wide, 
closer. 
Wings. 
Feathers. 
Eyes. 

A sound beside me. My hand flew 
before I knew I heard. 
I hit the hunter's arm as my voice 
hit me. "That's a Bald Eagle!" 
Gunshot to the heart 
of all that seemed to hold me 

"Don't cry. It didn't fall down." 
Kindness, gentle teasing, faces without 
anger. I tried to find my place again. 
Motor working against water. 
Eagle soaring. Amanda needs her jacket zipped. 
Grandma's busy with the babies. 

Going home, we stopped to see the eagle's nest 
at the top of a tall, flat-topped spruce. 
The hunter lifted his hand 
skyward to his friend, a Golden Eagle. 
The day softened. Children gathered stones 
on the sandbar. Mothers watched for tracks. 

That evening, women in the steambath 
spoke in English, led me 
to understand he hadn't meant 
to kill it, just scare it away. 
Bones are found, under eagles' nests. 
Sheep, bigger than the children. 

They may have known how I would someday 
watch my baby sleep, arms spread, 
his crib an open sky. 
How I'd cover him, treasure the warmth 
of his heart beating 
in the heart of all that holds.
Now we see and hear daily 
what the empty winter skies 
were ready to receive. 
Dolmoya, Tugaga', Tomo. Their cries 
lift our eyes. Their necks 
stretch forward, wings 
push air towards us. We breathe 
the end of snow. 
That quiet glow of sun on the horizon 
which held us close, lifts 
higher and wider each day. We watch 
knowing the river 
will break and flow. 

The bird names mean goose, duck, and swan 
in Dinak'i, the Upper Kuskokwim Athabascan language.
When sun burns holes in snow 
around trees, around the church 
drops of red appear: 
cranberries in moss, 
left from fall, fermented. 
Easy food! A bird 
can eat too many, fly crazed, 
kill itself before its nest is finished.
Heart muscle 
Pumping 
Its knowledge 
To every cell 
Of our body 

The moose 
He shot, the meat 
He gave me 
Knowing 
My hunger 

That night, that moose 
Roaming 
My leg, the calf 
Of my leg, awake 
My right leg, the calf 
Of my right leg, an ache 

A humming, wind 
Around velvet, hanging 
From antlers 

Next day, the story: 
"We saw that moose running. 
My Dad shot it 
Right here." Hand
On the calf 
Of his right leg 

Three years later 
Three thousand 
Miles distant 
That wakening 
His wife, death 
Beside her 
Like a husband 
Here that morning 
Before I moved 
A muscle 

Hand to hand 
The news, the words 
"He burned up 
When his house 
Burned down." 

Towels, they need 
Blankets 
Comfort, heart 
To hand.
Somewhere a house is empty of these lives, 
the mother beaver dead, the pups not born. 
Our hands caress the loss. Our thought contrives 

to name the brown and violet parts, as if, in naming, it revives 
the heart, makes loops and curves and folds less torn. 
Somewhere a house is empty of these lives. 

We lift the liquid cradles, cut them loose with knives. 
Water breaks on fur, feet, tail. Watching, we forget to mourn. 
Our hands caress the loss. Our thought contrives 

their birth. We wrap the pups in plastic, hang them high in leaves 
of willows by the river, to protect their perfect form. 
Somewhere a house is empty of these lives. 

We clean the inside of the mother's skin. All we do deprives 
her house of mud, sticks, food -- leaves her mate forlorn. 
Our hands caress the loss. Our thought contrives 

to find an exit. The living beaver slaps his tail and dives. 
We are enclosed in widening rings of scorn. 
Somewhere a house is empty of these lives. 
Our hands caress the loss our thought contrives.
In order to choose, he has to know 
All the trees, their age and strength, 
How each wood will bend and float, each twist 
Of the Swift Fork of the Kuskokwim. 
He travels by boat to these trees, to this.
Pulling, pulling, arm's length to chest, 
Mosquito net over face, but not hands, 
He makes lumber, bone smooth, almost as white. 
Thin as a fingertip, wide as a thumb is long, 
Boards take their shape in summer's long light.
Canoe, man, paddle, need all their strength 
From winter to summer, home to home. 
Fish eggs splash from belly to belly there. 
Full of meat, dried salmon, whitefish, berries, 
It carries him back to winter like gliding on air.
Fireweed, grass, the edge of the bank --
"Look here --" Hand-polished wood of the bowpiece 
Arcs towards a tree standing vigil above like a widow. 
She seasons its grave with her roots, her seeds, 
While the river keeps on swallowing dirt below.
When the bank collapses, the frame 
Is freed of its weight, and rides 
The river, past where the man is buried, 
Past Medfra, McGrath, to Bethel, the sea. 
It meets itself gliding upriver with all it carried.
Log by log 
when people moved 
they moved the church 
downriver 
layer by layer 
log by log. 

Among the trees 
they built a replica 
to hold the sacred place. 
It stands, still, 
hidden, among the graves 
among the trees. 

Like a vein 
the river holds the moving 
between two places 
where spire, onion dome, and cross 
rise above the logs 
like a vein.
The eyes of the bird I buried 
look up from the dirt. 
The girls ran away because 
I buried the bird 
that way. 

At a wedding 
everyone smiles. My mother 
smiles at my brother. She smiles 
at his bride. But looking at me 
she can't seem to see me 
before what ever is wrong 
was wrong. She can't see 
a wife at my side. 

                       I bury 
the wings of the bird I held 
carefully, let its eyes 
stare at the sun. The girls, 
when I'm not there, 
bring each other to look 
at the thing I have done.
Yesterday, snow was coming down, big flakes, 
and you were writing "Love is like snow" 
how it comes down so soft, one day, 
but the next day it blocks you in, or it is gone. 
Some of you left it newfallen, tender, 
how it should be, I thought, sixth grade love should -- 
then I remembered sixth grade, how all the girls 
wanted a valentine from Steven. He gave us 
each one, and we compared them. Two sizes. 
Charmagne, of course, got a big one, mine was small, 
and when Jane said "Let's see 
your Valentine from Steven," I said "No."
Then, at the bottom of the pile, a big white envelope, 
my name, a second card from Steven Deane. 
He was watching me open it. We both knew 
I wasn't pretty, he should like Charmagne, would 
go on being her boyfriend. But there was 
that moment, and yes, it was something like snow. 
Its memory blesses me now like your poems, 
their honest endings, melting away to nothing, 
or turning -- Angie's puppy, to care for like love, 
Damon's "Love is like football. 
I hope I will have a 100 yard run."
There probably was no dead cow 
rotting in the cistern, or maybe 
a jumble of bones. Who 
could have put it there? 
Did it die first, or did they 
push it in alive, hear the echoes 
moo all day and night, 
quieter, quieter, silent? No -- 
edges too high, circle too small, 
no cow so stupid. Probably 
not even true, just wood 
scraps, that headless doll, 
the part of the broom you can't hang 
dresses on, the part of the Christmas tree 
that wouldn't fit. Probably 
no dead cow, no bones. 

But big kids told little kids. 

I half believed, then heartily 
told, until I more than half 
believed. And the telling 
kept the cover on, kept us 
alive to tell the tale.
Yes, I also feel we have already kissed, 
like we say our letters cross 
as if there is an intersection 
we don't know is there, until 
the evidence arrives for each hand to hold. 

Each afternoon before my father came home 
my mother changed her dress, touched her cheeks with rouge. 
Fingertip by fingertip, each little scalloped jar 
would last for months, window swinging open 
on its golden pin, each afternoon, year after year. 

Bouncing on their bed, I argued with my sisters -- 
whose turn to have the little butterfly, 
opening 
closing its wings; the monocle; 
the bed box-elder bugs could sleep in. 

Eyes on its center, I watched a speck of ivory widen 
widen each day until the rouge was an untouchable ring. 
There was a day I held it warm in my hand 
when he came home, when they embraced. That moment of their own 
we circled round but did not enter. 

Warm in my hand through all these years 
through these recent months 
thinking of you, towards 
this certainty I haven't known 
I carried with me.
Sunlight 
on your old green couch 
like summer's warmest grass 
                        "rest here" 

I slept 
and woke, and opened 
my eyes.        Across the room 
you opened yours.        Everything 
opened.            Children 
were there.       Good. 
                                    Sweet. 
                                                Easy.
Someone may chew on your joy 
like a slug on a daffodil, 
their hunger and weight 
bowing your head to the earth. 

When they have eaten their fill 
they will be where they want to be, 
won't have to back down your green stem 
the way they got up. Nourished, 
they'll slide off into the dirt, and you 
will lift your new lace to the sun.
Fever has made him transparent -- 
he sheds his layers of school, 
Cub Scouts, kids on the bus, 
and lies on the couch, hot to my touch, 
but "Mom, I'm so cold" under the quilt. 
The fire I make in the woodstove, he claims 
for his own, "You're making it just for me," 
and that seems to warm him. 

The window, the time to look through it, 
grace of the trees, snow weight on branches. 
Small red glow of a bird, settling 
flying, lending its weight to the changing 
colors of one, no two, sharp points 
of light in the snow, on the tree. 
"If you get right here, and look, you can see them." 

So I do, and I see. The air holds 
like that, all day, gathers inside 
when the curtains are closed. Supper 
seems to have some of that light 
shifting its colors between us. Mom, Dad, 
Brother, and Baby.   But something 
hotter than birds, heavy as snow, 
weights our branches   landing 
leaving   landing again. 

"If you two ever fight, don't just break apart." 
"We won't. We won't."
"But Dad, you and my Mom. How 
did it happen before?" 
"We weren't right for each other. We were too different." 

"But me," he claims, looks to his brother, 
"and Glen -- we're just alike. If we were babies together 
you'd have to put arrows above us that say 'Lloyd' and'Glen.' 
We're not too different." 

No, we nod, yes 
you are right, you are not 
too different. And then 
just that moment, the light 
lifts the weight. We are all 
in flight, undulating 
from tree to sky.
Three times since your daughter was born 
you have welcomed your second child, 
only to grieve when the child turned back, 
while still your secret. Telephone cords 
have carried the weight of those years -- 
sister to mother, to sisters, brothers. 
And now, we've stopped asking. 
(Have we grown up, not to be trying 
to ferret out every secret like candy 
stashed in an underwear drawer?) 

Today, your family is visiting mine. 
We go for a walk, start remembering 
how we coaxed each other across 
that slippery log behind the blue house 
to get to the grassy place we'd take our dolls, 
balancing, too, their Sunkist orange box beds. 
I am careful not to mention real babies, 
though my son is not yet two. He walks 
eight blocks with us, and I admire (silently) 
his sturdy little legs. I speak of your five-year-old's 
beauty, as if perhaps you should be satisfied. 

Trying so hard not to say "baby," I hardly hear 
how you are naming every flower we see. "Peony" 
"Pansy Zinnia Iris." And then you pass your hand 
across the curve I haven't noticed in your faded sweatshirt. 
"Look at this." Your voice so quiet, the gesture 
born half-living.     I look. 
Then, startled, look again: 

Four years ago, my first Alaskan winter, I skied 
three hours one afternoon, through ragged birch 
and gray-green spruce, the ground a messy confusion -- 
rabbits' tracks on top of squirrels'on top of snowmachines'. 
The sky was gray with waiting, and I longed for home, 
or summer, or the brush of a ptarmigan's wing on clean snow. 

I skied back to all the home I had. 
Snow on the roofs of houses, nine 
houses made of weather-colored logs, 
the same dulled yellow as the circles 
marking the lengths of dogs' chains, 
dogs the color of dirty snow. 

And then blue. 
Truly I saw blue that day, 
curling its way into the heavy sky. 
I stopped to stare and I saw 
steam, rising from a steambath. 
The steam was blue. 

Now, as you speak, our walk brings us home. 
Glen tugs at my legs, and I lift him, 
my sky today so clear, expansive. 
You say you can't hope, you just can't, 
but I tell you: 
the tapestry your grief has spread 
can be what lets you see 
this child. Tiny ears, 
even now, are curling around our words.
Sand and water mixed and sucked 
our boots like mouths. The children 
touched anemones, for that same pleasure, 
something sucking, sweet, the little kiss 
it makes when we pull free. 

I was showing that to Glen, "Look -- 
it's like a small green rock. But if you watch 
awhile, it starts to wave its arms. It's o.k. 
to reach in and touch it." 
                                        Just that long, 
the time it takes to say that, I'd turned 
from my sister, her son on her hip, 
then turned again when she said, "Helen, 
take Paul." Quietly, like Mom might 
take a hotdish from the oven, "Put this 
on the table. Be careful. It's hot." 
"Be careful," she was saying as I turned 
away from my child, to reach for hers, held 
up from sand and water, sucking 
to her knees, her thighs, her hips. 
"It happened so fast, " we'd say later, over 
and over, safe inside all the "what ifs." 
Her husband (barely within earshot) 
couldn't pull her out, but could 
plant his legs, hard, on firm ground 
so she could pull herself. 

That's what she did. We didn't tremble 
until after she had showered. We held our tea, 
watched through a window as the tide came in, 
the child in her lap repeating, 
"Mommy. Dirt. Coat."
His voice was in my hair, his legs 
tight around my waist. 
His hands a knot 
behind my neck, his eyes 
closed, in my hair. My eyes 
were open, my ears 
open wide: Something was coming. 
Bigger than people. Noisy. 

It didn't knock us down. 
It turned away. But turned again 
and, noisy, came towards us. 
I kept saying It's o.k."
I keep saying It's o.k." Eyes 
open, ears -- open wide. 
Bigger than people. Noisy. 
It doesn't knock us down. It turns 
away. Turns again, keeps on 
coming towards us.
Weeks ago, her deer-smell left her body, 
left her skin torn open 
weighted by her bones. Four legs leap. 
Two legs cannot follow. Barbs, 
wire she barely sees, catch her hair, slice 
her skin, hold her in her struggle. 

If we had seen her then, no struggle 
of our own could have heaved her body 
back into the snow it came from. Each slice 
already deep into her belly, open. 
Her blood mixing with blood barbs 
would draw from our hands, lifting to her leap. 

We didn't see her, didn't reach to give that leap 
its extra muscle, extra inches. Your struggle 
heavy one, belongs to you. But these barbs 
were placed here, by someone paid to place them. The body 
of the thought that holds her open 
says "It's my land. I bought it. I can slice 

it through with fences anywhere I care to slice. 
If deer, or anyone, can leap 
my fence, I'll build it higher." We open 
our eyes to the length of that fence, struggle 
to remember the stretch of this land's body 
before any wires tautened their barbs 

across it. Like an alphabet, this strand of barbs 
leads to the mountains, offers us a slice 
of what we wanted whole...Sangre de Cristo..."The body 
of Christ, given for you. The blood of Christ..."The leap 
of light that makes these hills his blood. Struggle 
coloring the deer. We see her open 

heart offering this earth blood for its open 
wounds, holes drilled for posts to hold the barbs. 
Her gift is in her struggle 
not to give it. We stare at the slice 
her blood's warmth cut through snow below her leap 
from her dying to the living body, 

Earth. I pull my open jacket closed around my body, 
follow these barbs away from the deer's leap, 
struggle, with my brother, home, slice by slice.
                              The last days with my father, like the first 
                              days with my son, held us who labored 
                              towards them in tenderness in tenderness. 

Deer came to the salt my father had set out, 
licked it and looked toward the window 
where he sat, looking too. Chickadees and finches ate their seeds. 

                                   That first night, his hair 
                                   smelled of cinnamon. Is this the scent 
                                   of the inside of my body? 

Two owls came. One in the pinyon pine, 
one on the roof. My mother heard its voice, 
saw its shadow on the roofline, on the snow. 

                                   Would I love my stepson less 
                                   than the baby? The birth 
                                   gathered us all into a circle. 

My sister flew out the day I arrived. 
When I left, my brother stayed. We saw 
bobcat tracks outside the house. 

                                   I tried to step out of my dreams 
                                   at the first small cry, to let my husband sleep. 
                                   I slept during the daytime, with the baby. 

His hands were warm. They felt strong 
even when his strength was almost gone. 
His eyes were full of love and jokes and sorrow. 

                               While I fed him, the aurora crossed the sky, 
                               green, red, silver, white curtains shimmering, leaving 
                               the sky dark, above snow. 

When he said goodbye, he stroked my hair. 
His heart was beating, he was breathing. He stroked my hands. 
I probably won't see you again." 

                              At first, he cried a lot. One book said, "Maybe 
                              they're just sad to be here." Then he got interested. 
                              Little fingers tangling in our hair. A smile.
Because a man has finished, we gather to scatter 
his ashes and the small chunks fire could not return 
to ashes. A breeze lifts a strand of his wife's white hair 
lets it fall to her cheek as her hand lifts and lets fall 
grey streaks of what was her husband. 

One fragment settles beside a saguaro. Rib? 
Finger? Knee? A light brown mouse, unafraid, 
approaches, finds, in the small bone, food -- white dust 
it gnaws and swallows. Leaving tooth-tracks, 
it goes home, we suppose, as we go home. 

We eat together, sit outdoors as evening darkens. 
An owl swoops, and when we see it rise, 
we hear short, then longer trills duet 
across the desert. The owl we see carries -- a mouse? 
The mouse we saw? To its nest? To its young?
Seventeen miles downriver, no phone, I said, "I wonder 
how you found out what happened. Radio? No," 
he answered, "Black Bear told us." And to the question 
in my glance, he added, "Came right up to the house. 
Dad had to shoot it. And that same day a tree 
fell down, just like someone shot it, right across the river." 

So, when a tree falls down across our driveway, river 
stories, that and others, come all day. I wonder 
if Aunt Helen might be leaving us. Could a tree 
here in Fairbanks speak to trees in California? No, 
I tell myself, until the phone call fills the house. 
"She died this morning, quiet, as she slept." Each question 

opening, gathers to a larger question. 
Not just like a raindrop finds a river, 
finds the sea, becomes the water in this house, 
blood in our bodies -- actual water in the actual wonder. 
Wood, skin, thought, all made of water, and no 
boundaries hold. We cut, for firewood, the fallen birch tree. 

Chopping, in fury, the base of a spruce tree 
squirrels climb -- to hole, to rafters -- no question 
of "who was here first," no 
thought of the river 
of knowledge between us, no wonder -- 
This is our house! 

But that night, dreaming, deep in the house, 
brown bear, open-mouthed growl, beside the tree, 
sends me out, early morning, in wonder 
to speak words of healing, to question 
the tree, to hear how my roaring river 
of anger rushed through it. There are no 

squirrels. Not in the tree, on the roof, no 
sound of squirrels anywhere. The house 
and all around it is silent. As if a river 
had stopped its motion. This tree 
has taken the blows of my axe, each question 
I didn't stop to think. It holds them. I wonder. 

I wonder if all the squirrels are forever gone.          No. 
Three weeks later, like the best question, they're back. The house 
is quiet; the tree is alive, holding its voices, its river.
Because he gave me his immigrant tenacity to seek justice and live for poetry, this book is dedicated to la memoria di mio padre, Donato Gioseffi, nato nel 1906, Orta Nova, Provincia di Puglia, Italia, who died, 1981, in America. He ventured through Isola delle lacrime, "The Island of Tears" [Ellis Island] in 1913, with his mother Lucia La Rosa of Naples, surviving a miserable, but hopefilled, journey across the Atlantic on The USS Independence. Though disabled, sickly and poor, he shined shoes and sold newspapers to work his way through degrees from Union College and Columbia University. He was among the first Italian immigrants to achieve honors, a Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Psi, in the Liberal Arts and Sciences from such societies. Though he spoke no English upon his arrival in the U.S., and was taunted as a "guinea gimp" by his American schoolmates, he was proud of his U.S. Citizenship, achieved in his twenties, and read to me through my youth from Dante, Rabelais, Cervantes and Shakespeare in perfect English, though he also spoke Italian fluently, making me proud of his first homeland. His final words were quoted from Prospero's in "The Tempest": "The rarer action is in virtue than in vengeance," giving me an aesthetic ideal for action as his ul- timate philosophy. This paragraph is offered as a tribute to all who share the memory of their immigrant or enslaved parents' struggle in America. 

These poems are dedicated to my artist daughter, Thea Rinaldi Kearney, and my husband, Lionel B. Luttinger, with thanks for their supportiveness. And, it is dedicated to my five step children, especially Nina, and to all young people everywhere who keep a planetary conscience blooming in the light -- as non-violent activists like Grace Paley, Maya Angelou, Helen Caldicott, Judy Bari, Petra Kelly, Eleanor Roosevelt, Jane Addams, Emily Green Balch, W.E.B. DuBois, Lucretia Mott, Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, Nelson Mandela, Linus Pauling, Leo Tolstoy, Mahatma Gandhi, Chi'u Chin, Vittoria Colonna, Enhueduanna, and so many other true heroes and heroines of the worldwide, green peace movement inspire us and show us the way through the night to a new day in which, even so, "we shall overcome." Cynical sorrow gives no light to action and sheds no beauty in its wake, my father would say. But, sorrow wedded deeply to a love as beauty, makes human miracles happen everyday.

"The bloody massacre in Bangladesh quickly covered over the memory of the Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia, the assassination of Allende drowned out the groans of Bangladesh, the war in the Sinai Desert made People forget Allende, the Cambodian massacre made people forget Sinai, and so on and so forth until ultimately everyone lets everything be forgotten." 
-Milan Kundera, The Book of Laughter and Forgetting 
I was born in 1941. The sky was falling. 
The chairs of state 
were arranging themselves in "isms" of death. 
I learned to speak by fingering an apple, 
rolling its crimson shine around in baby fingers, 
because my mother's Slavic smile seemed to 
give it onto the table of my highchair 
in that Newark kitchen of new wintry mornings, 
bright leaves at frosty windows just met 
for the first time: autumn sun -- 
light, warm hands. "God bless Mommy! 
God bless Daddy! God bless spaghetti!"
I chortled up to the big people 
around my bedtime crib. When they laughed 
I learned I had a pen for a tongue 
that could please them. 

Meantime, the bombs were falling, 
the blitz began blitzing, Jewish, Polish flesh 
sizzled in Hitler's ovens, lampshades of human skin, 
gold fillings pulled from dead mouths 
remade into wedding rings. 
Are you wearing one? Has your gold 
ring come from a mother's mouth 
opened in mortified howl filled with poison gas 
in the stifling chamber where she bled 
menstrual blood down her thighs bereft of clothes, 
crushing her child to her crowded breasts. 

"Empathy" is my favorite word. 
My peasant mother -- war orphaned, 
my lame Italian immigrant father, 
"greenhorn guinea" they called him. "Guinea gimp!"
they shouted as he sold newspapers 
for the state "Education of the Poet"
he gave to me, raising me in the ghetto of Newark 
to speak good English where the worse that happened then 
was when a boy named Herby chased me, cornering me 
down the alley and kissed me, 
sticking his tongue in my mouth, 
choking me with mysterious sex as the other kids laughed: 
"Herby French-kissed Daniela!" A grand joke 
of the neighborhood. Nothing much else happened 
until I was abused by a Klansman in a dark jail cell 
one midnight, Sheriff of Montgomery County, 
the only law for miles around Selma where 
I integrated Deep South television as a journalist 
announcing Freedom Rides and Sit-ins, 
not out of bravery, but idealistic naivete. 

Somewhere in between then and then, 
I met a book full of rotting corpses, 
photos of mutilated bodies on battlefields 
or in concentration camps, dead faces distorted by screams, 
dying hearts impaled on bayonets, and all my orgasms, 
ever since have been screams of letting go of horrors 
-- guilty gaping skulls full of gold filled teeth. 
I'm a "Jersey girl" who grew up, part Polish war orphan, 
part Jew, half Italian immigrant 
daughter of a lame "guinea gimp," who was a poet dying 
of the word, "empathy," he carried on his back 
and taught me Shakespeare's English. 
He said I was too pretty for my own good 
and read me Yeat's poem to his daughter, 
but now I'm fifty-three, menopausal, insomniac, 
and don't care much about looks. My greatest moment 
of joy came in near death -- not when I was jailed 
by the Klansman Sheriff, but when I gave birth 
to my daughter who came by emergency Caesarean, 
bright with hope, lovely girl, 
do you feel the ambulance siren of guilt, 
grieving in your near death birth, the re- 
birth of your mother and your moment of almost not 
being new life greeting me in your eyes, my eyes 
peering back at me, questioning, after the fever subdued. 
Here's your crimson apple of being, daughter, 
amidst new wars and books always repeating themselves 
like autumn where death turns to beauty in dying leaves 
singing their windy sighs 
into the lies of hypocritical 
histories of hand on reborn hand by hand murdered 
and bleached to bones 
or held warm or cold at fifty-three I can't sleep 
well anymore. I grow fat eating love, I remember thrills 
of my childhood autumns when the maples sang with sparrows 
outside fall windows and the kitchen was warm as apples 
turned crimson in pale hands -- color of blood simply 
being before I found the book of corpses 
from ovens, battlefields, slave ships, 
the ring of gold that broke in divorce 
from your father whom I still love 
and mourn. Now, I take you, daughter, 
to the woods to meet the scarlet maples, 
feed the wild deer, crush the leaves 
and acorns with your steps, dance 
in the moonlight, your mother is no orphan, 
like hers was, your father is not lame like mine was, 
but the Earth, Our Mother, 
and all Her creatures swirl in clouds of gas, garbage, greed 
the language of oppression: "nigger, pollack, guinea, mick, 
kike, jap, kraut, wasp, spick."

Washington confronted its manufactured "Butcher of Baghdad" 
and "sand niggers" were decried on Wall Street 
where the banks collapsed in graft. 
A tenuous thread of life secretes onto the page thickens 
my eyes become someone else's. Are they yours, Daughter? 
I collect a book on ethno-centricism, chemical, 
biological, nuclear warfare and hate 
the rich nuclear and oil barons who are your enemy. 
We cannot live without enemies, Freud said, 
but, these oil, nuclear, chemical, and germ warfare 
profiteers hold us all hostage, you, me, and them, 
to the screams of skulls with their forever gold 
teeth, lampshades of human skin, their ears are ours 
filled with a siren of guilt 
from the history book of corpses, daughter. 
It talks to autunm. It says: "Empathize!"
Because we all die to live 
and eat and see and hold our crimson apple. 

Its beauty makes us sing.
On the crowded subway, 
riding to the prison to teach 
Black and Puerto Rican inmates how to write, 
I think of the fable of the shoemaker 
who struggles to make shoes for the oppressed 
while his own go barefoot over the stones. 

I remember Grandma Lucia, her olive face 
wrinkled with resignation, 
content just to survive 
after giving birth to twenty children, 
without orgasmic pleasures or anesthesia. 
Grandpa Galileo, immigrant adventurer, 
who brought his family 
steerage passage to the New World; 
his shoemaker shop where he labored 
over American factory goods 
that made his artisan's craft a useless 
anachronism; his Code of Honor 
which forced him to starve 
accepting not a cent of welfare 
from anyone but his sons; 
his ironic "Code of Honor" 
which condoned jealous rages of wife-beating; 
Aunt Elisabetta, Aunt Maria Domenica, Aunt Raffaella, 
Aunt Elena, grown women huddled like girls 
in their bedroom in Newark, talking in whispers, 
not daring to smoke their American cigarettes 
in front of Pa;
the backyard shrine of the virgin, 
somber blue-robed woman, 
devoid of sexual passions, 
to whom Aunt Elisabetta prayed 
daily before dying in childbirth, 
trying to have "a son"
against doctor's orders, though 
she had five healthy daughters already; 
Dr. Giuseppe Ferrara, purple heart veteran 
of World War II, told he couldn't have a residency 
in a big New York hospital because of his Italian 
name; the Mafia jokes, the epithets: 
"Wop, guinea, dago, grease-ball."
And the stories told by Papa 
of Dante, Galileo, Da Vinci, Marconi, Fermi, Caruso 
that stung me with pride for Italian men;
how I was discouraged from school, 
told a woman meant for cooking and bearing 
doesn't need education. 

I remember 
Grandma 
got out of bed 
in the middle of the night 
to fetch her husband a glass of water 
the day she died, 
her body wearied 
from giving and giving and giving 
food and birth.
You died in spring, father, and now the autumn dies. 
Bright with ripe youth, dulled by time, 
plums of feeling leaked red juices- from your eyes, 
pools of blood hemorrhaged in your quivering mind. 
At forty, I cliunb Point Pinnacle, today, 
thinking of you gone forever from me. 
In this russet November woods of Millay, 
I wear your old hat, Dear Italian patriarch, to see 
if I can think you out of your American grave 
to sing your unwritten song with me. 
Your poetry, love's value, I carry with your spirit. 
I take off your old black hat and sniff at it 
to smell the still living vapor of your sweat. 

You worked too hard, an oldest child of too many, 
a lame thin boy in ragged knickers, you limped 
all through the 1920s up city steps, door to door 
with your loads of night and daily newspapers, each worth 
a cheap labored penny of your family's keep. 
You wore your heart and soles sore. At forty, 
not climbing auturnn hills like me, you lay with lung disease 
strapped down with pain and morphine, hearing your breath 
rattle in your throat like keys at the gates of hell. 
Your body was always a fiend perplexing your masculine will. 
You filled me with pride and immigrant tenacity. Slave 
to filial duty, weaver of all our dreams, you couldn't be free 
to sing. So be it. You are done, unfulfilled by song except in me. 
If your dreams are mine, live again, breathe in me and be. 

You never understood America's scheme. 
Your wounded dream, father,
will never heal in me, your spirit mourns forever 
from my breath, aches with childhood memory, 
sighs for my own mortality in you, 
which I, at last accept 
more completely than ever when we 
laughed together and seemed we'd go on forever -- 
even though we always knew 
you would die much sooner than I 
who am your spirit come from you. 
Remember, "a father lost, lost his!" you told us, 
preparing us with Shakespearean quotation 
and operatic feeling for your inevitable death. 

Good night, go gently, tired immigrant father 
full of pride and propriety. We, your 
three daughters, all grew 
to be healthier, stronger, more American than you. 
Sensitive father, I offer you this toast, 
no empty boast, "I've never known a man braver!" 
The wound that will not heal in me 
is the ache of dead beauty. 
Once full of history, philosophy, poetry, 
physics, astronomy, your bright, high flying psyche 
is now dispersed, set free from your tormented body, 
but the theme you offered, often forlorn, 
sheer luminescent soul, glistened with enough light 
to carry us all full grown.
Guilt is a gift that is given 
to love, a wound in the heart 
that says there is duty, 
the message in the blood of family, 
as to the father and mother 
of duty is born the child of duty 
and to the sisters and brothers 
their name together 
shared in home, 
a place the spirit retreats to 
when the world is cold and dark 
and hunger stalks the woods. 

Blood is thick and red 
and should not spill like water 
on silent rock. 
My blood is given to the trees 
as I fall on my knees, alone, 
to you, father, who taught me filial duty, 
and all your kin have forsaken me 
Like you, I am Lear, alone on the heath 
with only one Cordelia, 
the one you said I resembled, 
and I've been given one daughter 
who carries your blood, but not your name 
which I've given the fame of duty.
wears a black leather jacket full of safety pins and leans 
on crutches. Her legs are mangled and her friend 
looks anorexic: in black tights which show her thin legs. 
Both have beautiful faces, lost looks, eyes sunken in. 
They seem like runaways and disembark the subways 
at notorious 42nd Street where pimps and dens of inequity 
have reigned through the century 
of whores and drug dealers dressed like rock stars 
of heavy metal bands. "Bad Brains, Circle Jerks, Jonny Rotten,"
who was, and murdered his girlfriend. 

Up and down the halls of the colleges, I hear 
the children "Mother F-ing'" this and that 
as they go cursing everything up and down 
the escalators and elevators and back again. 
In bus terminals and in trains, leather-jacketed kids 
pretend to be tough, their green, purple, blue dyed 
hair, depressed faces, hollow stare. 

One girl's legs seem gnarled with birth defects, 
the other's are too thin to stand on. 
You've seen them, too, and worried about them as I do, 
as you fret over the global heat trap, ozone layer, 
nuclear waste dumps, biological warfare tests, 
Savings and Loan scandals, 
dying economy, polluted land and groundwaters, crack 
in the ghettos and cocaine on Wall Street, death squads 
in El Salvador, Haiti, Bosnia, rape and rising taxes, 
unemployment up with your job down on the line, crumbling 
roads and subways, falling bridges, plutonium 
shot into space on rockets! And so you let them go, 
let them pass away from you as I do, 
knowing they won't make it far into old age 
like me at fifty-three worried about my heart 
and high cholesterol. knowing mv grandchildren, 
if I have them, may be as doomed as these lost, 
vulnerable, tough, black leather-jacketed children 
full of safety pins, purple haired and anorexic. I remember 
how hard my immigrant father worked 
to take himself out of rags 
and see how hard these kids work to wear them. 

Caught in my throat, 
I feel their anger 
sharp 
as a starved 
shin bone.
is neatly dressed in slacks 
and clearly Black, 
strong legged and a little fat. 
On her right arm an old grey woman leans pale 
and small and frail, bird boned, clearly white 
and Jewish. They are on their way 
to the country house of the stroke victim's son, 
no doubt. The old able-bodied Black woman 
is a practical nurse, I surmise from her blank 
but steady eyes, now the daily mate, 
constant companion of an older white woman. They 
are more together, day 
in and out, than all 
their children, husbands or friends. 
You might say they are married and walk 
like a bride and groom through the gloom 
of the Port Authority Bus Station. 
The work of the Black nurse comforts and frees 
the children of the stroke victim, but leaves 
the children she feeds 
alone. Who will walk with her when she's old, 
and will she manage to grow old 
enough to need a nurse 
or afford one?
Takes my ticket with his missing thumb, just enough 
of a stub remains to rest 
the small card in the crease 
where his thumb should fold into his hand. 

I think of my nephew with his hand caught 
in an antique car fan, four fingers severed 
and sewn on again, stiff forever. And old Uncle Joe 
who survived the Battle of the Bulge
in World War II, only to have his fingers crushed 
in an assembly line when he placed an aluminum sheet 
inside a machine that pressed it into pie plates. How his face 
must have paled at the sight of his fingers 
mashed to bloody pulp. 
He never really smiled again, and went on to marry a cruel 
and homely woman who gave him one good son 
and more misery after that. 
We never really knew if World War II or pies brought his demise. 

I have a friend who is blind since birth 
and walks and rides the subway to work 
everyday in New York City. No "seeing eye" dog, 
just her white cane leads her way. 
And we who see are afraid of what lurks in dark alleys. 

I remember the tale of a magician told by a gnomish Irish wit, 
about a trickster who performed slight of hand wonders 
with a missing index on his right hand 
never noticed by his audience 
thoroughly engrossed by his dextrous tricks. 

I remember my father, long dead, who 
with lame and shortened leg, learned to ride a bicycle, hop 
on a pogo stick, dance the Tango at Arthur Murray's Studio, 
like all of us, unwilling to be labeled 
as less than the best endurance of his test. 

The thumbless bus driver's lost finger shows 
like a wound in his eyes -- 
though he drives well and takes tickets with his missing 
thumb. How could he take them with his good left hand 
when the entrance to the bus is on his right?
looks as if she has been struck dumb. 
Being a Black woman in the South Bronx 
is difficult enough, 
but having a child like this! 
Still, she wheels 
him dutifully through the zoo 
in his chair, his long arms 
and full grown legs 
all askew, his head gently 
pillowed wobbling 
to one side 
his crippled hand 
bent to his cheek, 
dazed eyes stare 
at the trees above -- 
he does not speak 
or request ice cream, 
lollipops or views 
of the giraffe or lion, 
balloons or pizza. 
He requires only her patience, 
and her love dazes her 
as if she were numbed by his birth. 

Does she wonder why or has she stopped 
asking? I can see 
only patience in her eyes, 
the kind 
that crosses over despair 
to resignation 
and does not ask 
only bears 
"Why?"
Slow sensual openings happen in the concert hall, 
eyes, pupils, irises, lilies, leaves, heart valves, 
moist mouths, silk sleeves, flags, words unfurled 
and feelings far beyond their meanings 
as we listen and the blind soprano changes 
the pain of this dark terror, this inscrutable mystery 
we live into bright sound, sensed sublimity, 

Cantatas, concerti, canons, 
contain captured passions 
from centuries before, still sing: 
have pity human heart on human heart. 

Leaves absorb light, shed shades of green wonder, color, 
string, bow, dance, breath of the blind soprano's spirit 
heralded by comet, cello, violin, 
viola, big base viol, all played by women 
diaphanously clothed in pale flesh, yellow chiffon frills, 
she fingers Braille notes, translates touch to sound 
notes from the dark chambers in her head, echoing 
harmony spreads smiles on the blind soprano's lips, sonorous 
sound swells triumphant in the loss of sight; 
her trills thrill tears, awe from my eyes over-full 
with seeing as I feel 
your dear hand dance 
rhythmic touch on my shoulder.
She sings her heart out with a smile 
like Louis Armstrong on the subway's dusty platform 
with her band, a bass, guitar, horn player, 
and drummer. She keeps singing with a smile 
even as an old demented man dances up and down, 
keeping rhythm in front of her, blocking the audience view, 
with his big rag of a coat, swollen leg and crutch. 
Undaunted, smiling even at the old beggar who steals her 
spotlight. "Music Under New York" says her sign, and she's among 
the good jazz musicians who play in the subways for quarters 
and dollars collected in a hat or instrument case open 
in front of them. 
Making music amidst the rumble of trains and rush of people 
who are made more cheerful by their tunes. 
Evelyn Blakey knows that the homeless man 
who dances on his crutch is comforted by her warble. 
"Georgia, Georgia...just an old sweet tune keeps Georgia 
on my mind..." he sings along with her, grinning soul, 
the sort of smile that says: "I've been 
through it all, but sing anyway." Evelyn Blakey, listens 
to the horn jam, listens to the drums roll, 
with ecstatic eyes closed, face full of music, 
and the old beggar dances on his swollen foot, 
his ragged coat swings back and forth with his tired bones, 
his grey head bobs in rhythm, 
and Evelyn, Evelyn, Evelyn Blakely sings, 
her heart full of sonorous sound, 
her foot tapping the ground, 
her subway commuters gather around.
From the stone towers of glass eyes, 
ears clogged with grey smoke, 
fingers numbed by the Atlantic's winter winds, 
we unhouse our homeless heads, under fierce 
skies, merciless sun. While political stooges 
ply your votes in our shadows 
pushing your hearts 
with the stigmata of promises 
to house or starve us, the untaxable throng 
who defecate on your doorsteps. 

You'd rather hear good jokes and happy tunes, 
and who can blame your rejecting 
our grubby faces or paws always there 
thrust out at your comfortable walk. 
You want to go gingerly as if 
we're barnacles on your pavement. 
We wait with tremulous breath 
at the end of your line. 
We stink up your conunute. 
The very rich never see us through the 
darkened windows of their limousines, 
sleek, dazzling, chauffeured, sipping cocktails 
on cellular phones. 

Only you, the workers of the city 
who rush to your unbearable jobs 
steam past us in guilt, 
an umbilicus connecting our lives to yours 
in ghastly communion 
that squeezes your breath. 
Our breath is already drawn 
like an over exposed x-ray. 
We take no bite of your body. 
We're too weak to steal your watch 
or briefcase. We live in bottles 
and broken boxes on subway grates 
and sleep sick to death in 
your dark doorways. 
We drink the hot salt of our own dry sweat, 
wash our underwear in your park fountains, 
and dreams and wishes no longer hiss 
through our nights as we take up your benches. 
We can't afford tears. They would spread like our lice 
and tuberculosis and drown you everywhere, 
workers, New Yorkers. Go on your way, 
there is nothing between us. 
Let the politicos ply your votes 
with false promises to house or starve us. 
New York City of money as God at the top 
of your TV tower power, 
beaming out over the New Jersey of my birth in 
Passaic County, kid I once was from an Italian ghetto 
of Newark, and Little Falls near Paterson -- 
I view GE, UN, Brooklyn Bridge, World Trade Center, 
Macy's, PAN-AM, Seagrams, Gothic turrets of Capitalismo, 
machismo, city of stone towers, concrete walks 
racing up and down Park Avenue. Tourists from everywhere 
up here to see you -- German, French, Arabic, Italian,

like toy cars below. City of Gothic aspiration, 
city of death and poetry, 
city of telephone wires nibbled by rats and garbage. 
City I longed to come to as a girl from New Jersey, 
near suburban Paterson. I used to view you 
from Garett Mountain where we necked as teenagers. 
A lovers' lane lost in memory as I face your clock towers 
rising higher than your churches, your trees are dwarfs 
amidst the concrete turrets

and incinerators cough up your ethnic hatreds -- 
while down in your streets 
people scurry exchanging stocks, money, bad goods, 
satellite dishes whirl with signals, 
police and ambulance sirens cut 
the hum of gassy vibrations, King Kong climbs up to die 
and fall his black fur bloody with the glass knives 
of your squared eyes upon billions of windows and lips sealed 
in agony of the African-American who dies 
in the promise and lies

Autumn colors rust red and yellow of your patch of Park, 
central navel where trees and lakes bloom

indigenous owner of you, native dying under your erection, 
where shells are gone from your river waters flowing, 
under legs of steel bridges thrown over your voluptuous waters, 
East river flow, Hudson Valley polluted with PCBs 
spilling on my New Jersey, your smoke and garbage, 
from GE's bomb builders multinational headquarters

your buildings robbed of their sea breezes,

Phooey on you! I'm going home to New

back to Little Falls, 
back to Paterson 
again, 
and then up to Sussex County

full of the tears and sardonic laughter 
of knowing and loving you. 
Look for the name "Gioseffi," near Ginsberg,

I marvel and mock you. I hate and love you, 
throbbing wonder

you've 
broken 
my Jersey soul in two 
and taught me 
everything and nothing 
Neeeeeew 
Yooork!
The wind blows out of the gates of the day. 
Let the night keep what the night takes away, 
dreamt in a dream the heavy soul, somewhere 
struck suddenly and dark down to its knees, 
sighs as a griffon sighs off in the orphic air -- 
awakes as morning at the brown brink eastward springs 
and the whole landscape flushes on a sudden at a sound -- 
the clang of waking life; the streets are stirred, 
            birds fly to the glistening roofs and sing; 
an omnibus across the bridge 
            crawls like a yellow butterfly, 
while I stand on the roadway and on the pavement grey 
and dream that beauty passes like a dream 
            fastened to a dying animal.
Memory of autumn, of menopausal bleeding, 
and the blood from a creature you hunted 
in the autuirm woods oozed over a wet rock, 
you used as a table in the brook, 
carving the meat from the bone, 
skinning it down to naked flesh I squatted 
behind a stump, shuddering at the death 
I'd seen, crying secretly as I peed and bled 
into the dying and wondrous leaf soaked earth. 
I'd wanted to go with you, 
in this awful autumn of aging, I'd said I go 
bird watching with binoculars 
as you hunted with your shotgun. 
I was tired of my girlish squeamishness, 
of worries of bombs poised in silos, 
germ warfare bred in laboratories, 
chemicals stirred to deadly alchemies, genius death, 
a lump flowering, a cancer blooming in my left breast 
to be removed next week by the surgeon's laser knife 
all in the hope of flesh 
how the deer trembled to its death 
first day of hunting season 
fattened against winter from summer's gathering, 
nibble by nibble of wild berry, young shoots, 
lichen and wild fruit-only to fall 
in a leap over the swell of forest floor, 
into our dell crunching leaves, a flurry like the explosive 
dive made by the osprey as it splashes into the lake 
to seize a fish from on high. Suddenly, 
there in the quiet gully of noon, leaves rustled, 
twigs cracked as the deer ran toward us, seated silently 
in wait, sounds squirrel chatters, bird chirps quieted down 
from our alien intrusion of the woods bleeding red 
oak and yellow maple, beech leaves carpeting 
the floor of cathedrals, trees' gothic in their reach heavenward 
toward dazzling blue sky. Camouflaged by bark, she leapt 
into our gully 
where your shotgun was poised beyond all 
my arguments against its cruel blasted noise. 
            "From the beginning of time, men have hunted!" 
This is how I stay in touch with reality. 
When the secret police come for your family, 
you want them to have the only weapons? 
A man has to know how to survive. To hunt as he's hunted!" 

Terror everywhere in the global heat trap, 
puppets of oil and nuclear barons 
elected by advertisements for more profits. 
Homeless dying in the streets of our city 
while Turks were driven from Bulgaria, 
Armenians killed in Russia, Hungarians 
murdered in Rumania, indigenous people everywhere 
destroyed in apartheid systems, the Philippines stolen 
from Filipinos, El Salvador from Salvadorans, 
as Haiti's rain forests were chopped to dust 
and an Iranian and PAN AM jet crashed 
like fallen deer into a gully killing your son 
as this doe fled another hunter's gun, flew into 
our murderous view and I shouted, "There!"
and you spun around and fired 
into this bleeding autumn turned 
to glorious color -- 
dying leaves fallen to fertilize 
the next coming of leaves 
back into roots of bleeding trees 
like me, bleeding too much as I grow old 
and matronly, thinking of him -- 
your young son gone forever 
on his college semester in Europe 
into oblivion -- 
gone amidst the garbage of greed about to backfire 
as shotguns that kill the killers holding them. 
But, your aim was accurate, your gun well kept, 
you shot the doe, bagged it, the first time 
I'd seen you kill, 
though I knew you'd got deer before 
and in winter wild boar 
fried squirrels and possums since you were a boy 
escaping alone into the wild where 
your Jewish father, a Turkish immigrant, wanted you to learn 
to survive, defend yourself: "A man 
must be a man to be a man!" he'd said, 
and I was tired of arguing non-violence 
to you and the rest of the warring world. 
With my bird watching binoculars, 
I'd joined you in the hunt 
and saw the deer coming toward us, 
my eyes and ears sharper than your fading ones. 
I wanted you at seventy to win, to feel young again, 
as the week before you'd lain 
in an emergency ward 
needing a transfusion. You'd bled 
too much from your aging gut. "Acute diverticulosis, 
an ailment of old men," the doctor said 
and sent you to your hospital bed. 
I wanted you to feel strong. Your hand 
squeezed the trigger 
and the doe fell, trembling 
and I covered my ears 
and unexpected tears stung my eyes 
as I watched you fire again 
to finish the quivering animal -- 
a second shot to the temple, meat 
for the winter of your seventieth year. 

While you carved, I peed blood into the red leaves 
and listened to the starlings rustling the branches, 
the sparrows chirp in the brush, your knife 
on stone, carved 
the doe into meat, all her intricate muscles bled, 
her beautiful eyes stilled, her graceful head 
a trophy for a wall, her skin to be tanned 
into leather boots and gloves, her ribs exposed 
like our vulnerable hearts pumping 
until they stop soon. Beyond this autumn 
the laser knife of a brilliant and self-destructive technocracy 
will carve my breast, remove a tumor 
to determine if time is benign, 
and if it is, 
I will cook for you 
the delicate, gamey venison 
which I won't taste, 
as I eat less and less meat 
and you grow old tasting the hunt, 
controlling death by giving it and I give into it 
bleeding more heavily than ever in my youth, 
as I grow beyond the years of fecund mothering -- 
our different ways of facing death, 
your fight against it, giving it, my giving into it, 
the power I can't possess of gun, or knife, or cock- 
sure ways. 

I wept like a squeamish girl 
seeing the deer tremble 
and your old hands trembling, too, as you carved 
its heart out and I knew that you 
are hurt by your own necessity, 
saddened like me by blood autumn, 
her shimmering beauty.
The future of religion
is in the mystery of touch.
-D.H. Lawrence
peacefully on the lake to see what we might sight, 
some exciting species of wild life 
for our list of wondrous things we've seen since spring 
and there before us on the high limbs of a russet sugar maple, 
ablaze with October sun, beside a burnished, 
crimson Chestnut Oak, 
sits a flock of Turkey Vultures, 
red headed with hooked, black buzzard beaks, they pose 
before rays of morning sun, wings spread to preen and bathe 
away vermin from under the their wing pits. Black feathers bask 
in iridescent hue. These ancient birds were sacred to Egyptians, 
carrion cleaners of the woods, eaters of the sacrificial entrails 
of deer, sheep or lamb, bear or rat, swallowers of wasted flesh 
who never kill to eat, but simply make the dead fly 
from the rotting earth, soar toward the sky, 
taking dead souls heavenward. 

Holy birds, Black Vultures 
who can make the carrion flesh of the dead 
rise again into the autumn sky ahead, 
you who never prey on the living or kill as we 
and the mighty hawks or eagles do, 
carrion eaters, big black buzzards of the blooming autumn, 
please fly with my dead spirit to the tallest trees, 
bask my soul in sun, bless my pain with fun 
of soaring free, run with me heavenward flapping flying, 
sailing on the wind amidst the flutter of colors and sun 
mixed in every hue and mood, bring me to your forest roost, 
tell me all the secrets of night so that I might 
not fear the rotting purple and blue flesh we all become 
when blood autumn finally leaves our view and we he dormant 
as the trees in an eternal springless dormancy! 
Black birch dead upon the ground, I gather your debris 
to light the fire and make my home blaze with the warmth 
of your death in the hearth. Tree, once a thing of beauty 
that I burn the way a buzzard sails on wind, 
nurtured by the dead turned to carrion, heal me, let me learn 
to love my impatient husband again after our cruel fight, 
and let my soul fly with the birds above the glass still lake 
wherein the sleek fish eat and mate.
and view the "freaks" 
watching us, and offer a smile 
to the snake charmer. She nods at us 
            knowing we are lovers returning from paradise. 
At night, just before dawn of the last day 
of an old year, we have a common nightmare. 
Each falls asleep and wakes alone 
in a dream on a cold shore 
far from home, without shelter from wind, sun 
            dark, cold, heat. 
I feel like a tiny breathing thing alone in a vast night 
no hand anywhere to hold mine. I call to you, friend, 
brother, lover, husband, but you can't answer 
out of your body, alone in your dream crying for friend, 
sister, lover wife! 

We wake into life 
sure of dying under the frozen sky 
and mute stars, glistening with winter light. 
We have returned from paradise and visited a carnival 
many times again, to view the "freaks" watching us 
and smile at the knowing snake charmer. 
Sometimes, as we look at the pain in the other's eyes 
each recalls the nightmare had separately, 
but we do not speak of it. We hold hands into new years, 
knowing all new years turn old, and listen to the night, 
snow creaking in mounds, and the air iced from the Northwind

For the sake of the other 
we do not say 
how each together 
is alone 
returning from paradise.
I'm your nurse because the doctors 
wear penises. I'm Scarlet O'Hara 
wearing an ancient Chinese mask at your 
funeral. Yesterday, I looked into 
the mirror and your scars 
were on my face. I call to you 
because fathers disembowel children 
as a ritual to war gods. I call to you 
because dart throwers chase me 
through a circus of elevators 
and orphans wander 
wounded by madness in the streets, 
asking for my last slice of bread. 

I'm the Whore of Babylon 
sucking your love, 
pulling weeds from your throat. 
I'm the sheepdog wandering in your dreams, 
the white cane tapping away your blindness. 
My breasts are sensitive to the rain 
because I listened to the rain with you.
Oh my love, I will carry 
your lantern ahead, 
whispering light for your steps. 
Please touch me to come to you. 

Toward the light, Father, Mother, 
shining harbor ahead, 
all grievance closed on our breasts, 
sound coloring words to breath. 

Glide with me through my river. 
I've come this way, too, 
slithering out as new flesh. 
Our bodies burst into bloom. 

Hands know silk, skin and petals, 
wet mouth, apple's breath. 
Place roses into my skull. 
Our bones are white, pupils black. 

Oh my love, shine with my life, 
be as my brother, 
yin and yang flowing bright milk 
from autumn leaves in the grass. 

Oceans swirl, marble blue earth, 
hear, taste, feel, see, heal, 
toward the explosion of light, 
eyes opening souls from death.
They've flown south now 
and one Great Egret fishes the pond 
as Broadwinged Hawks begin their migrations, 
kenneling on thermal currents of wind 
off above yellowing mountains. 
Now, Snakeweed blooms along the trail choking 
white and purple Asters. A few bleeding 
leaves fall amidst wilting greenery. Poison 
Ivy turns red with warning. 

My eighty-three-year-old mother still argues 
with my father, twelve years dead. Their hatred 
reverberates in a back room 
of my head, rattling memories of my lonely childhood. 
Their loathing for each other 
colors all my days with pain. I loved him 
because he loved me best, but I look like her, 
my face and spirit tear 
at each other. 
I am the child of hate. 

A wounded love sprouts like a weed 
from watery depths, 
uncultivated, 
flowers, white and purple, bloom, 
even in these days of dying 
leaves. 

Beyond winter, 
no one 
grieves.
Over frozen rocks, water flows, 
"like time" poets say. Time, the only thawed thing in this 
grey winter dark. Our lake is ice 
and I have come at fifty-three to a quiet dutiful life. 
You, older than I, have lost your strength 
to arthritis. Pain killers have numbed you 
and your passionate nature waxes like the moon. 
Hypertension's therapeutic drug makes you drowsy, too. 
Beyond the horizon, there's all ice and snow. 
I crunch on through the dormant woods, 
leaving the icy lake behind, and you, 
reading in our warm bed full of books. 

Here fallen Eastern Hemlocks killed by Asian blight 
he cracked across forbidden ice. Their pedestals, drip dry pine 
needles on the frozen snow. 

No, not even a vulture 
climbs the horizon of barren trees. 
I'm on my knees without God for a crutch, just the wondrous science 
of relentless cycles of seasons, new life from decay and carrion. 
A few crows cackle and caw above, a welcome sign of vitality. 
I have a dear daughter grown into her own love and work, 
an aged mother to whom I feel undying duty, 
I have my work ahead and that is all. The lake is frozen cold, no 
fish leap or stir in her. Even the flock of vultures who lived above 
her warming their wings in fall, sunning lice away, have strayed 
to another lake. Nothing rides a thermal, nothing flies or stirs 
on the horizon all is dull and grey. 
I crunch on through the frozen snow. 
I do not even dream of spring. 
I listen to the laughter of departing crows. 
Time the only thawed thing flows 
over the icy rocks and streams 
into the woods until somewhere longer, 
farther than I can go it finds the ocean, 
where it loses its deltas to become 
part of a churning entropic universe 
too vast to know.
Oh God, or Goddess, make me a child again 
beneath the dreaming tree where leaves drop golden 
sunlight all around me 
in a fantasy of benevolent faith 
which extols itself in "Thee."

Now, no answers come from above 
or below. 
Silence sings in my aging cranium -- 
throbbing like Prospero's 
to let loose infinity. 
Eternity embraces entropy. 

"We are to blame 
for the blood that flows from wounds." 
says love as it glows red from the bled heart 
under the hanging tree. 

A fairy land of angels, gods and goddesses 
cavorts in mythologies or legends old as Gilgamesh, 
answering from the brain as it talks to itself, 
right to left, left to right lobe, 
each one of us is alone on the vast globe 
doomed to dust or carrion. 
Even in the best touch of skin to another's within, 
each is alone 
with conscience in search of piety 
which comes easily in old age 
when the animal appetite 
is done with the flesh 
and longs to escape 
body into pure mind, 
as if there were a God or Goddess 
who were kind enough 
to embrace the perfect zero 
we become 
when we're done with breath 
and animal flesh meets animal death.
I try to sing so that our scars will glisten 
as crystal goblets full of purple grapes 
we raise to our lips, our last supper 
on Earth we'll share as communion: 
bounty of blue water, black earth, afloat 
in silence except for our stammering 
before She passes into the past 
sizzled by fire or ice our shimmering 
nerves cling together on the edge 
of threatened futures. The past is 
eternal only to lovers. 

I want to sing to you in a language 
of light bright as feathers, hope, 
alone in my skin tonight, 
sings as it falls in slivers 
of light through air as rain in my sight 
and my heart wells in my throat 
as a bird struggles 
against a night predator 
and darkness presses over it. 

We worry if our children will live to speak 
a language of light and sing to their children 
of silver apples of night, 
golden apples of day, 
each must gather wandering over green meadows 
where daises or wild violets spring, 
blooming gloriously to death beside brooks, 
streams froth and tumble dreams 
from nooks and crannies, run 
over rocks, secret forest places where dear deer 
nibble wild blueberries, or lions stalk 
blood from the language of light. My incessant hope 
tastes tongues of light; my arms will hold you 
safely in the night, until time 
in time 
is done.
shines, at last! 
Spring will come again. 
It's an old song, you say. 
But I say 
the heart must learn it anew. 

Now Chickadees and Titmice 
peck amidst the winter berries 
and pines. 
Soon the Rubythroated Hummingbird will flit 
among honeysuckle blooms, 
a new calf will be born 
in the barn on the hill 

and a pregnant doe 
will nibble my crocuses 
before they're full.
One lone Loon glides along the lake. 
Lost from a mate, 
she wears a smart suit of black tweed, 
checkered and flecked with white. 
Her black dagger beak poised 
to spear a silvery fish 
as she dives deep to hide 
from the Canada Goose who swims too near. 

After a long wait 
she surfaces far off. 
Ancient heavy boned bird, 
different from all the rest, 
superb diver, odd singer, like you, 
I sing my weird time, loony with the beauty of spring, 
rebirth amidst the fears of a weakened heart. Blood 
circulates poorly now as wrinkles prepare me 
to want less of life. 

Little peach beak of the Goldfinch, yellow as my Forsythia bush 
which droops its fountains of bright blossoms over the walk, 
crimson cardinal flower and bird, sun rise 
and sunset of natural color, wonder of Earth, 
amazing bright green and yellow visions of thawing woods, 
it is enough that April has come again 
like an idiot babbling and strewing flowers, April 
the kindest month, 
reminding me it's enough 
to live like a lonely loon lost 
on a cool lake, just to see the Bank Swallows swoop, 
the iridescent Tree Swallow sail across the azure sky, 
the Barn Swallows leap up with the loon's cry, loony loon am I, 
lost on the lake, time a threat now as I call my last cries 
over the water -- violins in my ears! Sing, gold 
and red raspberry finches, Song Sparrows, white throated 
ones, too, and Wood or Hermit Thrush, sing 
your sweet tunes, sound your small flutes 
while I laugh like a loon 
lost in dandelion wine, lost in Wood Anemone, 
searching for the Wood Ducks who shyly fly, white wing stripes 
on a dark silhouetted sky, high and higher, 
no clumsy flyer like the dinosaur loon, 
lost in its own wild and plaintive tune. 

Tap of Downy Woodpecker, 
laughing song of the Northern Flicker, 
sweet throated Yellow Warbler, Mourning Dove, 
tiny Black Capped Chickadee, Grey Tufted Titmouse, 
sing to me, whistle away, fill my day with lazy wonder. 
I'm tired of diving down and rising up 
to gulp a silvery fish. I want to float, heavy 
boned on the deep water, no waves, no wind, 
only gentle balmy ripples of spring. 
I can't grieve the bombs that could be trees, 
the children that didn't come from me, 
those who have not lived or died too soon, 
let me fall on my knees in the grass 
and sleep in the meadow on an old deer path. 

Sing to me loony Common Loon 
tunes, laugh a nocturnal laugh, of how the last 
first green of life, the last noon of sun, 
the last glimpse of light, 
matters!
A pregnant woman gardens, naked in her glass greenhouse. 
Plants she tends and water grow from her fingers, 
green silhouettes against her full belly; 
round in the moonlight, a rapture 
flows through her breasts to the mouth of a child, 
containing all melody, 
while father-starved boys 
in dark cellars of crowded cities 
slam-dance to anti-music made of nuclear explosions. 

Earth hemorrhages Her plush wealth, bloody bombs 
phallic shaped from wheatless silos, 
prisoners of peace accurately aimed 
hate fail-safe or fail-deadly force 
opposite to love, to eyes kissed, 
bread baking in warm kitchens, 
babies at nippled breasts, 
suckled on green leaves which rise serene 
from muddy earth, wet with animal dreams 
as our human hands 
in these dark times 
touch bliss.
The missile like a final guillotine of a man's world 
stands erect against immense history -- 
a red and purple sun 
sets as the scent of orange flowers 
excites the wind. 
Giant waves, powerful 
Greek tragedies, drum rolls 
greet ears like shells 
filled with the voice of the executioner 
as he reads his list 
to the crowd and trees tremble; 
big continents protrude like butterfly wings, 
flutter in the atmosphere of blue seas 
swirling in drifts and currents 
as they cling to Earth's surface 
as She spins amidst women's wails 
and birthings. 
The cathedral explodes 
with organ music by Bach and Haydn 
and a machine-gun in the rhythym of Lohengren 
grinds blood from the passers by 
who are surprised to die 
in the middle of the priest's sermon. 
Chaos like a riot of birds 
chatters over the bridge 
to the other side of nowhere 
until a fragile child small and wild 
weeps her way, shoving through the crowds of the dead 
who have come to witness their own execution. 
She peeps out bleary eyed from between the bloody legs 
of the woman who sells refreshments to survive 
and with her innocent eyes 
enchants all meanings into place 
like a rose garden fu11 of trellisses and cakes.
Because of the cat's eye marble of your passion, 
you old sage of roses, I slap my hand 
on your big rump, old word whore! 
You discovered the secrets of your body 
only to keep them silent to the grave. 

You contemporary of my late Italian grandmother 
whose cadaver appears before me in my dreams, 
her clitoris gleaming like a ruby jewel -- 
grandma who gave birth to twenty children 
alone in her bed, her own midwife. Grandma 
who never knew the numbing power of orgasmic 
potency, pool of cosmic energy 
for the tormented body. 

For you, Dear Grandma, and for you, Ole Gertrude, 
for all the women who were buried in their 
living bodies, hiding sexual hysteria from doctors 
who performed surreptitious clitorectomies, 
or sewed their lips over the tiny bud of ecstacy 
so men might go on supreme through 
thrusting centuries, 
for you, 
rain of the womb, spindle of Aprhrodite, 
bud of Venus, tree of Daphne, moon of Diana, 
I chant the song of the three, "Tender Buttons," 
the sign of the trinity: 
           "THE NIPPLE, THE NIPPLE, THE CLITORIS,"
and The Holy Ghost
is "The Mother of Us All!"
Oh, anus, through the centuries 
men have smuggled diamonds in you 
and dope. Homosexuals have written odes 
to your sensational glories. 

But, I have never wanted more from you 
than a comfortable passage 
of the wasted fuel of my life 
as death the exquisite trap door 
opens for the fall through eternity: 
exit from life, 
light into darkness, 
contrast, perception, 
crucifixion, resurrection. 

The iris of the eye 
opens as you -- 
the flower of the body. 

The flower in the eye 
opens to let in sight, 
and you, 
the flower of the body 
to let out shit, 
and from sight, 
from shit, 
come flowers 
most awesome as they bloom themselves 
to death.
falls from the wet mouth of the old dove 
and sinks into a river of fire rushing toward the delta 
where the oceans will catch flame and evaporate with lust 
and the children's lungs will be sucked of oxygen, 
but the president doesn't notice. His polished desk 
blinds him with veneer. 

And on the street the crowds rush to glimpse the television 
screen alight with the fire of electricity 
like the body politic 
as it broadcasts the baseball scores. 

It's the final playoff of the World Serious
and we are here, all of us with flesh eyeballs alight 
with the wings of the dove as they flutter on beyond 
the red and blue sunset 
which continues to outdo itself year after year 
since the mastodons crept from the sea of blood 
baring mammalian breasts full of warm white milk 
for all the many colored faces of earth, 
children as they suck life from leaves of grass 
withering now in the threat of fire or ice, 
eternal winter which comes to each, one by one, 
but need not be passed in one blast of heat to all the young 
buds of being wafting perfumes as they burn 
from bright autumn rust, beauty so enough 
that it kills the caring heart with its own ceasing.
I had a dream, which was not all a dream. 
The bright sun was extinguished, and the stars 
Did wander darkling in the eternal space, 
Rayless, and pathless; and the icy Earth 
Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air; 
Morn came and went -- and came, and brought no day.... 

-Lord Byron from "Darkness"
I.

Where can mad money be spent 
on windless meadows, vaporized forests, 
under dusty snow falling forever acid, 
when love sucked from bleached bones 
in ashes floats in particles of lips, 
songs, paintings or poems for eons 
on and on to nowhere's nothing...? 

I can't comprehend nothing of nothing. 
"Non capisco nulla di niente,"
my Italian grandmother said 
before she died at sixty-five 
of emphysema from her coal stove 
burning through the cold 
of dark winters like the eternal one to come 
exploding from Godhead to warhead 
through centuries of silly soft women 
powder-puffed and waiting for men 
to come and come, and now they may come 
no more...to smell perfumed grasses, or see 
breasts of velvet blue mountains, red sunsets 
or morning's rise after night closes their eyes 
forever, Mother Earth, yes, Capitol Earth, I spell you 
rich with color, mood and mud. 
Slime and beauty beyond mortal words 
from which we come with our ears and tongues, 
giving ears and tongues to children 
and sleek weapons that could demolish us 
to metaphorless similes of dust.

Walt Whitman's voice extolled these states and stars 
as Democratic Vistas -- but they were stolen 
from the Redman who reaps cancerous lungs from mined uranium, 
and fire water spills from Her green hills, 
polluted valleys, fields of waving grain, 
full of nitrates, purple mountains majesty, America, plump woman, 
your cornucopia fills with poisons, spills 
with nuclear barons' oil kills, 
distilling carcinogens from landfills full of greed's garbage. 
Dolphins, seals, and sea otters breed P.C.B.s. Exxons and G.E.s 
P.R. lies and missiles labeled "Peacemakers" that can sizzle 
billions in an instant, killing all forever fools of nothing, 
no 
thing, 
unimaginable as zero so profound, 
all Promethean longings go unbound.

Have you noticed how angry women are now 
between their laughters, 
tears loom among their witches' brooms, 
because they feel the end approaching all. 
It makes their gonads reel with rage. 
Since there's too little love for berries, peaches, melons, 
mud, and disillusioned children, women have less hope 
about the future as their intuition throbs between their legs 
forced open to keep life coming from legislated bodies, gates 
to heaven or hell, since Satan fell from grace, 
into Eden's apple trees and Eve fell on her knees 
before him in male mythologies of misogynistic verse. 
Earth, so little loved and cursed, She'll explode 
with manufactured greed for plastic fruits and flowers, polymers, 
poisonous whims of monolithic powers, 
money mad with mad money 
grabbed by Morgan, Bechtel, whose name 
rhymes with hell, Grumman, Hughes, 
who helps hold the fuse, AT&T who owns me 
and thee, down to our bones. 
Executives profits for motifs and motives 
to please the very rich with more riches, and mutants, 
birth defects of atzent orange or irradiating bomb tests -- 
as astrophysicists describe a black hole 
sucking everything to entropy -- 
and a gap in the ozone layer of climatology 
widens as acid rain kills lakes and forests and aflotoxins 
like alien enemies, biological warfare agents rain 
back down on us. All poisonous greed can't be flushed 
away in a Rabelaisian toilet of the universe, 
as it comes back to curse our children, poor or rich in one 
uni- 
verse 
all that matters us into matters beyond us 
and our separated nations 
as each child of us, comes in innocence, dumb with beauty 
and the notion of all motion, centrifugal force, 
unites nations, flagged by the same photo of Earth 
from outer space, mother of an entire race of one 
blessed or cursed Earth, Mother of Us, All 
oceanic womb -- 
man to all children 
and we are one in all and only all in one is won. 

IV.

There's no exotic enemy! No "them" and "we." 
Just ourselves, deep in "us" 
a fascination with the exotic other -- 
dwells in dark sentiment -- this passion 
with the blood of the other 
stains our hands and tongues. 
We poke at the fruit, to see 
its juices run on the ground, 
tear the rose from its stem, scatter petals to the wind, 
pluck the butterfly's wings for the microscope's lens, 
plunge a fist into a teetering tower of bricks, 
watch the debris sail, explode fireworks 
until all crumbles to dust and is undone, open 
to the curious eye. Does this or that creature die as I die, 
cry as I cry, writhe as I would if my guts were ripped 
from the walls of my flesh, my ripe heart eaten alive. 
The probing questions of sacred exploration, 
as if science can progress
without empathy. Does a penis feel as a clitoris feels? 
Do slanted eyes see as I see? Is a white or black skin 
or sin the same as a red one; is it like me? Does it burn, 
does it peel, does it boil in oil or reel in pain? 
The obsession to possess the other so completely 
that his blood fills the mouth and you eat of her flesh 
from its bone, and then know if she, if he, feels as you feel 
if your world is real.

These are the word wounds, 
roots of mushroom clouds to rise 
from the pockmarked earth: 
"Guinea, dago, spick, nigger, polack, wasp, mick, 
chink, jap, frog, kraut, russkie red, bastard, kike, 
bitch, macho pig, gimp, fag, dike, cunt, prick,"
word wounds to make stench of flesh follow 
sprayed dust of children's eyes 
melted from wondering sockets, animal skin, thighs, 
men's hands, women's sighs 
roasted in a final feast of fire 
beasts caught like lemmings 
in a leap to Armageddon's 
false resurrection. 
Word wounds rise from visions of charred lips, 
burnt books, paper ashes, crumbled libraries, stones 
under which plastic pens 
and computers are fried amid the last cried 
words, smoke to pay lip service -- 
as Orphic light rages 
against the dying of the light 
and all dust into dust returns 
to the last word, 
sigh of a burning leaf turning: "Life live, 
leaf live, love life leaf live..." 

VI.

There are those mornings 
when the spirit stretches out of itself, 
reaches up from the breast, radiates from the groin 
beyond sex into song and sensual delight 
to see light fall on leaves, 
growing green glisten with animal sight 
-- and the Romance of Photosynthesis begins 
all beginnings. 
There are those afternoons 
when knowing beyond saying christens; the body 
with love for its own breath 
and being breathes in harmony with leaves. 
There are those evenings when the sunsets with red 
and blue glory -- even over teeming cities 
and glass windows blaze wondrous color, 
though children rot in slum gutters 
or drug themselves out of the pain 
of all that's unfair or insane. 

You've smelled the familiar wood, mud, fern aroma, 
as red and gold leaves spread a cover over 
dried grass and whispering wind on water sings 
the stupid and stupendous music of creation, 
of an awesome autumn milk-
weed bursts in silk 
puffs of seeds and a water spider speeds 
patterning the water mirroring your face 
amidst scarlet fringes of a maple flecked with green, 
serene skies utterly blue with the lies of our lives. 
You've seen, heard, felt such awe and you, too, 
know wounds of words can burst in fire. 
You're tired, too, of trying to speak 
the language of leaves as you grow older like me -- 
lichens blooming on the side of a dead tree. 
So, sing a song of peace with me, please, 
because death turns to beauty in the dying leaves 
and moss is soft and inviting. Tell me, toll me, 
please, listen with me to the leaves 
aching with eyes and animal sighs 
and cries for mercy in the fall from grace 
to this quiet, quiet place. 

VII.

There are still those days when peace reigns 
in desire's mouth and nothing more is longed for 
beyond the taste of color, music of hearts and lungs, 
sigh of sun, wet of water, touch of the sea, sweet 
juice squeezed on the tongue. Then 
the body is possessed by light 
until the pitcher of sleep fills with milk 
poured into the moon and a song of sleep 
glows in the throat -- giving night its breathy music, 
as tortured beasts howl far off in city caverns, 
cries from eyes where genitals are plucked flowers 
crushed by sadistic curiosity, bled 
into troubled sleep. The child 
melted by synthetic doom shrieks. 
A premeditated alchemic act devised 
to sear human flesh, mutates the baby's body 
into horror. Brilliantly, germs are bred in laboratories 
to foul enemy armies with venereal disease; prostitutes lurk 
on the edges of military bases which protect the rich 
from the rich -- selling flesh like excrement. 

VIII.

In civilized rooms, 
rich executives wage secret money wars, 
deal drugs for profits -- devils disguised by designer clothes 
live elegant lives that keep the poor unfed 
and laboring in heat -- fountains of their sweat 
fed to gun lords who want more and more 
corpses of untimely death buried in pieces under flowering trees 
without eyes, hands, guitars or slippers. 
Those who die tortured will scream in all our nightmare dreams 
until brutes are bred into angels, and prisons emptied of agony, 
workers clothed with more than chains, until 
puppet dictators lose their strings, 
until sparrows sing like nightingales, 
and fly like herons above the war for crumbs, 
-- until I learn to love you with your different body, 
your disposition imperfect as mine, 
until then, death will go on wearing the soldier's uniform 
of his illustrious career -- a salute masks his leer. 
Like a bullfighter he carves 
the mighty bull, to still the beast 
with graceful cunning, his sleek 
sword hidden in his silk cape. 
His missiles poised in their silos 
empty of grain, filled with fires of the final feast 
he'll eat with his cavernous mouth, carnivorous teeth. 
His masculine chin chews children, spits 
their wasted bones into cinders, swallows 
their budding bodies, and the honey of their 
breath as it expires, drips blood as saliva from his lips, 
a blistered grin. In his hand, he juggles 
the blue and crystal ball full of swirling waters, 
over a steel and concrete gravestone 
where all our names are inscribed with Dante, 
Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, Lady Murasaki, 
Emily Dickinson, Rembrandt, Madame Curie, 
Einstein, Luther King, Chi'u Chin or Ghandi... 
fading into dust beyond the last stupendous flash 
of life urges into cocky deadly fireworks, 
eternal winter, as names 
and the word could become in the space of moments, 
syllables to no one and nothing perceives 
light or darkness, as you and I, love, caress 
each others' eyes before we touch, hand on smile inventing love. 
But cold and silent of human song the planets could spin 
unknown to anyone or anything -- 
fragile as our flesh which thrills with love's 
impulse, electric touch of empathy's 
mysterious imagery, waters flowing mind 
which cannot dream "nothing" without thinking "zero" 
as a perfect some- 
thing of the algebraic kind. 

IX.

We are all one human creature 
bound by one earth 
under one sun -- moon mutant nations where all children's 
ears hear "Songs of Innocence," 
as corporational apes of toxic wastes 
breathe alchemic greed bloated powers bigger 
than all our tiny flesh made lives, 
or little seeds of giant Sequoia trees, 
most ancient living things of earth, 
older than king's tombs, true cathedrals 
of the blue Pacific as she rocks, swirling 
melodies with the Atlantic's green currents, 
currencies...rain songs, sounds swell wells, 
lakes, faucets, brooks' runes, oceans' tunes, 
mystic drafts of summer wetness, cool drink seeping 
into thirst, 
Earth 
nearly all water of which we are made one human 
bound by one wet planet 
under one maddening moon, 
under one arrogant sun, 
under one pale watery moon, 
under one 
bright thirsty sun.
"Hold on to dreams 
For if dreams die 
Life is a broken 
Winged bird 
And cannot fly." 

-Langston Hughes 

"The wind? I am the wind. The sea and the moon? 
I am the sea and the moon. Tears, pain, love, bird-
flights? I am all of them. I dance what I am. 
Sin, prayer, flight, the light that never was on land 
or sea? I dance what I am." 

-from a poem, Isadora Duncan, by Carl Sandburg
I hadn't watched maggots 
closely before. 

The way they squirm and burrow 
their way in. 

What curious things! 

How characteristic of sperm. 

Somehow, 

how like wheat!
He thinks of her, a furry animal -- her center 
soft, warm with worry -- 
but wet, inviting wonder, 
a place he can fill with himself.
She feels his need pressed between her thighs, 
waiting to be opened by his touch, his fingers will the thrill 
of her desire -- light explodes 
a sunburst in her dark mind -- 
her face like a winter when she worries 
about all the murdered flowers tom flesh tortured shrieks -- 
her skin like a spring blooming petals, pitying 
pink, yellow, purple veined 
buds of beneficent being, his red heart bums him 
with life she forces like an indigestible summer of merciless heat. 

She thinks how mean and hard he seems at times 
and pulls herself in and closes 
wanting him to open her with his need 
and then he rubs her back and neck 
and she hears his sweet murmur 
as she longs to be strong enough to mother him 
and his seed always waiting to spill into her 
and make her bloom like a round melon of light 
that talks and sees roses which must die to be 
beautiful like the sea from which she smells 
her own body throbbing and rolling 
as he thrusts need into her need to be kneaded 
necessary as bread to earth planted in spring so that grass 
grows for the eating of all things vibrant in the green sun 
of summer festering with insects, birds, blossoms, sticky throated 
buds oozing sap from her lap full of flowers, syllables spill 
prattled from small round tongues, animals that come 
seeing out of her breathing belly -- laughing, weeping, seeping songs 
and dances of pleasure, pain wonder -- bleeding in and out 
of the mystery that only skies can know, 
only mountains touch, 
only stars breathe.
has a strength 
destined to know me. 
Wherever my lips touch you 
they find a kiss 
as if my hands 
had made you of clay 
exactly 
as I would have wished. 

Your hands, your arms, 
your chest, thighs, 
your special parts 
are missing parts of me, 
vessel into which you fit, 
one river of two streams 
flowing into one ocean. 

Before we met, 
I was on the verge 
of automation. 
As metal I'd have rusted, 
atrophied. 

As flesh, 
I'll stay alive unto death 
feeling your hands kneading me 
to breath.
The blood of a fish is like 
the blood of a bleeding woman. 
But we call fish cold blooded 
and a mother's love has the 
hottest blood in the galaxy. 

The seagull's squeal is like 
the squeal of a newborn child -- 
tormented, 

and the blood of a man 
is like the blood of a wandering gull 
hunting free and hunted. 

All blood is red so that we can see it, 
and anger is red 
so that we can know it 
and all bleeding blood is angry 
like the wound of war.
They want to have the babies when they are old, 
though the cocks of the walk, 
their breasts and bellies grow, good Papas, 
into womanhood, emotions are let go 
like tears that run down steel swords gone dull. 

Their eyes brighten with pretty daughters 
who sparkle like their mates did long ago. 
They want to be pregnant with girlish life, 
to feel themselves rise quick again 
just at the thought. These men women 
have expected to be perfect for them, 
creatures of confused mother love, 
searching for the breast of Honeysuckle summer 
again, longing which grows into 
fleeting gold, then silver snow. 

I keep having a dream of an old woman, anxious rhapsody, 
disapproving of me, and wake 
to realize I have grown old 
enough to disapprove of my younger self 
full of mistakes, and the dust 
is flying, radio-active everywhere. I can't 
shovel the snow fast enough to get back on the road. 
I left the windows open and the car's buried 
inside and out with snow, snow, snow 
and dark comes soon. Everyone I ask gives 
a different direction on the roads. Cold. 
I can't remember any of the ways. 
I'm too old for babies now. 

Sun on leaves is enough for me 
if profits before children and trees 
don't waste all to nothing, I'll listen 
to Vivaldi concertos to fill
my aging years. I'll make Japanese water colors, 
or sing along with birds, learn their tunes and colors: 
iridescent Magpie, Black-capped Chickadee 
chirping in a narrow pine tree, Great Blue Heron or Jay, 
Red-tailed Hawk, Screech Owl, Mourning Dove, 
Ruby-Throated Hummingbird, Indigo Bunting, 
Scarlet Tanager, Redbellied Woodpecker, Yellow-bellied 
Sapsucker, White-breasted Nuthatch, Redwinged Blackbird, 
Brown Creeper, Golden-crowned Kinglet, 
each with his own personality 
like the tiny pink mouse, in my daughter's snake cage 
waiting to be eaten for a desert snake's prey. 
We are all like that, struggling on our backs waiting 
to be blown by greed to dust or snow 
as we grow old and some say there's nothing
beyond flesh gone dry. 

There are leaf patterns, 
bubbles baked into the bread, 
chemical variegations 
even as the mouse is slowly ingested, 
mammalian blood becomes reptilian, 
all chums in cauldrons of smoke and dreams. 

How intricately a snake loops, 
what a slow moving toward death, 
what cannibal embrace, 
the mouse's head in the snake's, 
what a quick moving toward death, 
what a slow moving 
toward life, 
what a quick ending is death. 
Please 
let the children live. 
Everyone 
who's sane 
loves 
them.
I attempt to rearrange the past in Venetian Palaces 
built by blood thirsts or delicate lusts, 
full of plaintive strains of Monteverdi 
trilled in Gothic arches. 
Through a camera's eye 
I look backward on hope, 
every lost stroke between us 
mesmerizes mind 
into something fair and kind -- 
as here, in the present, dying drones 
drone in autumn sun, 
leaves rot, purple asters turn to grey seed -- 
like tiny mushroom clouds dotting umber and sienna land- 
            scapes of late autumn, muddled earth 
            with the garbage of greed 
everywhere, crushed cans, chemical poisons, wasted paper, 
but in my mind, dusk pours in slanted light of high windows, 
twilight motes dance amid red velvet curtains 
in Venetian Palaces above shimmering waters, narrow streets, 
we lie embracing, intertwined forever 
until darkness erases us, 
the woods here in dark. 
The stamina of memory opens an aperture, 
a window on forever, before 
the nuclear age 
when only a burnt out 
floating of Earth toward Vega, 
after the sun was done, 
was an end so far off 
it couldn't be 
imagined.
when I've grown a green 
kelp sea-green beard. 
Just let me he here by the sea 
in sand beneath 
a constant acclimation of wing to wind 
currents carrying gulls cries 
as a Cormorant cuts across sky 
oh, wake me up 
in a hundred 
years 
when 
I've 
grown a green 
kelp sea-green beard 
among the dunes 
of time and sun 
among the dunes of seaswept runes 
among the dunes of seas and times 
among eternal windswept ryhmes 
among forever singing chimes 
after all the human crimes 
are done.
I have some wild notion of following the birds 
to the rim of the world, 
flinging myself on the spongy turf there 
and drinking forgetfulness 
until roots twine around my knees 
and worm their way deep inside me. 
My mind spills like hot coffee over the saucer 
of my life and drowns in its own dark ecstacy. 

Lulling my pain with the aspirin of death 
taken in small doses nightly, 
I sit beside the fire of your soul, 
glowing flesh in the light, 
never quite awake. 

A match struck behind my eyelids 
flares against my retinas. 
A shadow dance of puppets begins: 
mother, father, child, lover 
whirl in a Chinese lantern show 
until the frenzy that would bum me quickly 
in a puff of ecstasy reels away. 

Spun out in a slow red river of sound 
from the mouth of longing, I used to measure my time 
in monthly cycles, forging a link, a secret transaction 
of modems, voice answering screen. I talk to you as if to 
myself, stammering an answer. I try laboriously to bear 
wheat, voice to breath, tongue to tongue. 

We end as a feather floats from the sky, 
vaults the dark pool of mind, reflecting the moon 
like a woman's buttocks turned up again to heaven.
Yes. It's true. Sugar maples are disappearing. Too 
many chemicals! "The trees, trees, trees" 
are all I want to look at and know, says Jerzey Spacive, 
Hungarian linguist dying of AIDS 
after surviving Nazi Germany's 
camps for Jews. "I can't even listen to music!" 
says he. "I anticipate all the notes 
that fade into nothing. No thrill 
comes from classic sound that used to comfort me. 

Just the sunlight, moonlight, sunset on the trees, 
they're all I want to know, all I see. The trees 
are everything to me. The last sight for all should be of trees, 
Bartlett pear trees, pyrus with their sweet golden fruit 
dropping from thick glossy greenery, pointed leaves 
with fringes folded inward like arms on my breast." 

"Yes, apple trees in the orchard on 
the horizon. Hazelnut, Hickory, 
Poplar, Rock Oak, Blue Spruce, Blue Juniper, 
Red Cedar, Yewberry, Ashberry, 
Red Oak and White Oak, Red Pine and Grey Pine, 
White and Black Birch, 
aromatic Eastern Hemlocks dying of a blight, 
Rare Elms and Douglas Firs, Redwoods 
cut for timber, phenomenal ancient 
Sequoia Gigantia felled for silly furniture. 
Rain forests murdered for grazing meat." 

"A twenty-five percent decline and a loss 
of nearly half of new trees 
over the past thirty years," the forester told me. 
"Synthetic chemicals begin to appear 
in their rings at the dawn 
of the Industrial Revolution -- poisons 
traced to the Ohio River Valley, airborne 
to the Northeastern forests...."

Jerzey murmurs as he slips into his forever sleep: 
"Seeds of the endangered Whitebark Pine of the high Rockies 
are a staple of the grizzly bears, red squirrels, 
and song birds, here, and there. 
The dark green aromatic Hen-docks are falling to an Asian blight, 
wooly adelgid and fiorinia scale, which also invites 
infestation by spider mites, 
and so the Eastern Hemlocks go 
the way of the American Elm from its Dutch Disease, 
and the Chestnuts before them perished, too. 
The trees are going to entropy, acid rain, chemicals and PCBs. 

The trees are all that comfort me. 
They hold all the answers unspoken in their branches. 
Trees make time visible and fragrant, they are our breath 
and breathe with us as we breathe they live 
and we live as they breathe and greed is killing them. 
The trees hold all the answers. 
Ask them. We enter the grove and are changed, 
peace rains down in green over us. Green which holds the mountains 
together with roots, green which scatters lacy shade over us, spins 
out our breath in freshened sips. 
We drink the rain with them. 
Beware, the trees are dying with us. 
Every sapling rises up to breathe with every child in 
its rightful place under the sun, 
set me free 
into the arms of my Copper Beech tree."
In the morning 
there will be sunlight. 
There will be day. 
One evening 
I'll die 
and the sum total of the universe 
will continue. 

I'll erase my ears, eyes, nose, 
tongue, fingers, 
but the continents, mountains, music, 
pyramids will persist. 

Behind me 
the future will accumulate. 
In earth like a man in a woman, 
I'll make food out of food. 

When I see the last sunrise, 
I'll hear the first bird. 
I will everything 
to everyone. 
As we begin our trip 
to Shangri-la, then hope 
that the way is long 
down mountain streams where the water 
is fresh with adventure, 
up pathways to where wisdom gathers 
on mountaintops. Let's not fear 
the nightmares 
sent by xenophobic monsters 
invented by projected greed. 
We will not meet them on our path 
if our spirits are aloof 
and sensual emotions touch 
our bodies 
with each other's hopes. 
Come, swim with me in the cool lake as we age with youth 
and then let's watch the sunsets, red-orange and blue, 
purple as dawn, in our own magical garden 
which borders the gardens of others, 
where we work renewed, never judging the monsters 
we meet in our nightmares. 

Perhaps we'll never greet the Lochness Monster 
or Big Foot, Tyrannosaurus Rex, 
Dracula or black-booted Nazi, 
bigoted Skinhead or exorcising priest 
of exclusive nonsense and gobbledegook,
fierce fascist, or self-righteous fanatic, 
if we refuse them transport, 
if our spirits stay vigilant, watching over 
our body's good work, touch others 
with joy here and now, and forgive and live 
close to the Earth and all her gifts, 
sunsets and rises, apples, 
pears, corn, wheat, rice, 
things that matter to children.
on the autumn pond afloat with shrivelled leaves. 
Nothing stays. 

Feelings in the blood drain 
from the corpse as seeds fall 
beneath dead leaves. 
Love is half of longing. 

When we are together, longing goes 
as a sunset sinks behind a mountain top 
leaving a halo glow. 
Seeds root beneath rotting leaves. 

I must be careful 
not to long for the ache 
of wanting you, to lick the sweetness 
which is gone from me, to miss 
the wish 
which is unfulfilled 
more than savor its repose, 
here, now, 
the sun on the autumn pond, 
an iridescent duck with his mallard brown 
mate amidst the dying leaves, 
lilies still bright with beauty shiver as they go 
into winter, 
thrilling with the cold that will 
come when it will come, 
as necessary as the setting of the sun.
daughter child full grown 
of my very flesh 
into your own 
separate being, 
seeing 
me as free 
from your need of me. 

Now, I need you 
to feel, 
my mother's need of you, 
as I return to the dark 
of my lonely widow's room 
to day dream of your visits 
offering spring flowers 
to my granite tomb.
Stars dance their light 
The night sky shivers. 
Listening to waves, 
dance, my daughter! 

Wind wanders fields 
singing in the wheat. 
Hearing the winds song, 
dance, my daughter. 

Earth spinning holds 
children in her skirts. 
Feeling the moon's hands, 
dance, my daughter. 

Love winning fills 
all with Her power. 
Seeing Her sunrise, 
dance, my daughter. 

Love losing sighs 
in wet wounded eyes. 
Burying my bones, smile 
and dance, my daughter.
I danced with ears in my belly, 
sang songs from a sonorous throat. 
Academicians thought I was crazy. 
Men imagined I was being sexy. 
They sent me foolish invitations 
which lead no where. 
I tore them up laughing. 

As Mirabei, at the shrine of my navel, 
I worshipped the leaves that flowed through me. 
I lived as the symbiotic tree. 
I've dedicated my body and soul 
to the American Demeter. 
I sent Her radiance through rythmic muscles 
out into the universe. 
I worshipped Her redwood forests, Her 
Natural Cathedrals, the fruit of Her fields, 
the labors of Her women, 
Her Indians and immigrants. 

My Goddess was the good Earth. 
I came from Her milk, Her breasts. 
Hypatia gave me the spirit to dance 
with my soul in my belly. 
I smelled Earth's music, heard Her colors, 
tasted Her fire and knew 
the dancer is the dance.

or creatures crawl riding foam to hurry back to salty home, 
as oceans pound fruit to pecking pipers, 
or shells keep tunes in earlike chambers, 
filled with sand and sea to roam 
like songs rejoicing feathered nest and comb 
as warm eggs crack chirping hunger, and a child slithers 
forth to touch, smell, see, hear earthly cries and laughters 
pushed suckling free from nurturing womb -- 

my tongue is loosed beyond a private caroling, my pen prances 
urged by mysterious love as if it had no part in what is sighed 
as Earth sings praises through me, my eyes are green sea, 
red skies, wildflowers, a child who dances 
well when loved beyond the pain of men's tribal wars, pride, 
threatened suicide, and bloody rivalry.
The peach is 
a belly dancer's fruit. 
It has a navel eye for seeing 
the world through the skin, 
rounded buttocks 
good 
to place against the hand 
the way earth reminds flesh 
of its being. 

Through the eye of the needle, 
death is a country 
where people 
wonder 
and worry 
what it's like to live. 

The sullen wish to live 
and live soon 
to be done 
with death 
and the happy 
want 
to stay dead 
forever 
wondering 
will it hurt 
to live 
and is there death 
after 
death?

                If his life had been a novel, he'd have quit
                reading long ago: characters
                unbelievable, plot almost building, to fizzle
                out halfway.  A taunted weakling all
                along, the hero, finally bearing serum to
                a dying child, only falls asleep in
                snow, not even real, but bills, paper.  He
                dreams of no back-slapping heaven of parents
                and wives saying we never thought you
                had it in you.  Not even a dog comes
                nuzzling through at the last, a wounded
                wolf befriended in his youth.  Maybe one
                reader, the child he didn't know
                he had, snowshoeing by.  "Here," he gasps
                pressing the vial into a hand, "Nome.
                Dying."

                Bitter, numb already, you turn
                into the wind.  Your problem now.
                He tells me I'm a risk:
                he is small, blond, Mississippian.  I trust him.
                I am fighting my genes, he says, fighting
                my father at fifty-two pulling off the highway
                that had become a gray blur
                trying to call to anyone from a phone booth
                while it broke in his chest, calcified, knobby
                like an ankle bone
                and then again, over and over
                in the hospital while doctors
                ran up and down the halls trying to stop
                that sequence of explosions,
                that string of firecrackers.

                You see yourself as glass
                for the first time, transparent,
                shaken and fizzing, a bottle
                of soda, and start watching
                for potholes.
                Or maybe you just learn to live
                with a cart with square wheels
                thudding in your breast
                trying to carry whatever it is
                there,
                before it's too late.

                This is how to become
                old -- worry only
                about yourself.
                So that if there come
                bombs out of clouds
                or lovers into rooms, saying
                goodbyes, learn
                how to cup your hand around it, as if
                in a world of wind
                there is this one candle
                that must be saved.
                I pried them from baseball
                bats, made them learn my
                lines, sell tickets,
                and we swept the red
                dirt of our dank
                cellar, strung a curtain
                (shower), lit stolen
                candles, called it
                a tragedy.

                Somewhere halfway through
                the plot began to improvise
                itself, a flock of script taking
                wing, the spear (rake)
                used on the wrong end.
                A wooden sword cleft
                the gray loaf of yellow
                jackets who descended like
                critics, the plastic curtain
                sizzled black fog.

                As I rounded the dogwood,
                mother after me
                with the rake/spear, I looked
                back and decided to go
                into poetry:
                a frieze, a tableau -- Jimmy
                Jacobs, his cape a still
                attached and whirling
                muleta to Poochie
                the dog, had delicate
                blond Joe Nelson, who would
                die at ten, in a headlock,
                the basement behind spewing
                ash and smoke, a sacked
                city, bees swirling
                around them like golden
                snow in a crystal ball.
                Waxing the car, I straighten up, old
                in the back, rag in hand, remembering
                suddenly for some reason Grant
                Park, its deep hills, a zoo, cyclorama
                with one slumped soldier half plaster, half
                paint, his leg stumps blotted with flaking
                blood, the world around misted with cannon
                smoke, buzzards, burned pines arrowed in
                the sides of Atlanta's red wound, invisible
                choirs humming Dixie. Where my
                mother took watermelons, busted
                and ate them with either my father
                or a sailor named Faris, where her
                club met the time they hurt her
                feelings and she dragged me out of the marble
                pavilion to drive around awhile and cry
                and they all hugged when we came back.
                At reunions aunts wore membrane thin
                flower dresses, gray buns, witches'
                shoes, and uncles brown suits, snap
                brim hats, badges and blackjacks. They
                fried chicken, took black boys to
                the icehouse, went to war, came home, died.
                I can smell them like a seance -- chicken,
                sawdust, talcum, gunpowder.  And car wax.
                Did my parents drive there on
                Sundays after the war?  With me asleep
                in a picnic basket or in her did we
                polish an old car under the trees as if
                we all had forever?  I'll never know now.
                Tonight they're running it again:
                I ran in the back yard for days yelling
                "Shane!  Come back Shane!" after I
                saw it, and just remembered where:
                we'd leave the house to get there
                before dark, cool at night in the summer
                and I cried quietly, mosquitoes and voices
                in the back seat with me,
                where I saw "The Thing"
                huge and strong, vegetable, almost
                unkillable.

                Those were the good old days before
                I got disconnected, like Alan Ladd only
                far less fast or blonde,
                more like James Arness, stranded and vicious,
                bleeding dust when cut.

                He wore a buckskin shirt and went
                away because he loved his best friend's
                wife. When they found him
                under the ice, my hair
                rose as they held hands and spread
                out across the snow, making a hushed
                circle of that shape, everything
                I ever wanted to be inside.
                He laughed at her, saying
                "But I'm already in hell."
                She said, "All right," angry,
                "you remember the cabin up
                at the creek, when we'd all go and
                Opal and Tommie would be there and all
                the kids, and we'd go dancing every night?
                Well that's what heaven is.
                And we'll all be there," she shouted, "and you
                WON'T."  He opened his mouth
                as if she'd slapped him back
                for all those times he'd hit
                his only child with a butcher's hand
                hard as a bed slat.

                He was mean as a snake
                when he was young, she said
                meaning drunk, beating up black
                men in the ice house, braining a
                cuckold with a ketchup bottle
                like his grandfather, the general
                who said the only good Indian
                was a dead Indian.  I remember him first
                a mile high, putting in
                his dentures, a pink snail curled on
                a row of pearls, sliding it in
                and biting with a wet "chuck"
                looking down and saying
                "You Irishman, you."

                He joined the next week as the choir
                sang "Just As I Am," and mother,
                crying, dragged me behind her
                after him down the aisle, went
                every Sunday after, driving slowly
                home, the cars lined up for miles
                on the two-lane road behind
                his stories as if he didn't
                hear the curses and the horns.

                His black neighbor found him
                in the yard, a small purple
                stain at the white temple.
                In the hospital clear tubes made sounds
                like a straw at the bottom of a cup
                and he held my hand
                hard.  When she touched him asking
                "And who is this?" he snuffled out
                words, eyes closed: "That's my
                baby," his mouth said, empty, drawn
                like a purse.

                She still dreams about him
                all the time: a little girl
                again, lying in the cabin at night she hears
                a band far away playing the "Down Home Rag"
                till the music dies to nothing,
                and a fog begins to grow.
                Somehow human at last
                his face rises from the blue mist
                of the night woods and calls her his baby
                above the sound of rushing water.
                The summer Del
                Shannon had a hit with "Runaway"
                I was failing algebra, and my
                grandfather told the story about slugging
                his English teacher, jumping out
                the window to run away and work
                for the railroad, and eventually have mother
                who had me.

                Clark Goswick and I, on the last
                day of school, before report cards
                came in the mail, left
                for Daytona Beach
                to work on fishing boats and marry
                Cuban girls, but a cop caught us
                after only two miles and four hours.
                As we walked up the driveway, bleeding, our backpacks
                solid with canned beans and bristling with fishing
                rods, mother called from the porch
                "Did they let school out early?"

                When I fall across my desk
                stricken, teaching
                "The Road Not Taken" for the thousandth time
                an old salt on a dock somewhere
                in Florida will be splicing
                rope and telling yarns
                to the dark children
                of children.
                There's this circle of orange
                earth, the runner having to get
                across.  The coach slammed the ball
                at me, who looked up and saw
                Joe, the biggest and meanest in the third
                grade, in the middle grinning.  I still see my
                running, in Christmas football pants, legs in
                my mind moving faster than any
                boy's ever, fly's wings, the ball
                across my breast like a Bible.

                On the other side, amazed, I looked
                back to see him kicking dirt, hating
                me with his teeth.  I trotted to the
                coach, handed him the ball like a star
                and woke up face down, laughter in
                the air like dust, clotting in my
                mouth and eyes, coach over me, his
                hand on Joe's shoulder, saying
                way to go.  Don't you NEVER quit.

                I replay it all the time, only
                egging Joe on, blindside the kid
                in the red pants.  And more:
                kick him while he's down, already
                learning on the ground how there's
                really only one
                emotion: huge, sitting
                in the center, all
                the deadly sins, and virtues,
                shame and love, hate and
                pride, patience, greed, envy, even
                revenge just
                legs.
                I learned early what that verse
                meant, "For now we see as through a glass
                darkly."  My mother wouldn't buy me any
                glasses because then I'd be a foureyes
                maybe even play in the band like the rest
                of the pansies, or like my father, polishing
                his lenses, head bent, hands
                before his face as if
                praying, no football
                hero.  Teachers tired of my leaning
                in from the front row, chalk dust in
                my hair, begged her in notes: like the blind
                man in the Bible miracle, he sees men
                as trees, and trees as lime
                jello.  Going out for passes, I was
                lost like the end of the world when
                everybody running sees the sky but me.
                The coach threw his hat in the dust, "Son,
                have you EVER caught a pass?" I never
                did, but when she gave in, let me have
                my specs, it was like heaven, she even more
                beautiful with wrinkles, people gross
                as bears now limber as hickory, spare
                as willows.  And the trees, firmed up,
                erect at last, were like emerald fish
                with each scale whole and succinct,
                as if they would never, ever drop a leaf
                or a pass.
                At the end she'd wake
                to find him kneeling, head
                on her lap.  You're working yourself
                to death, she'd say; he, if I
                didn't have you to come home
                to, I'd blow my brains
                out.  Thirty years they snarled, circled
                a bone, sometimes me, some
                days my sister, or money.  If you
                were a real man was on our coat
                of arms, with never marry and
                there is no happiness, Nullus Felicitas
                Est.

                So I crave sorrow
                like home cooking, need
                to walk an aisle between
                people dressed for it,
                someone in white
                robes and blood red emblems saying
                words over it, the dead mailing
                lead crystal, cut glass doorknobs
                that don't fit for as long
                as we both shall live.
                When my father died my mother and I got
                drunk every night, told each other
                secrets, why I really left my wife
                that he cut the tips out of all her
                bras, why he wouldn't go fishing all
                those mornings, on the beach together
                with a Polaroid while I slept.  He left her
                nothing, like that old joke, she laughed
                I've got money enough for the rest
                of my life, if I die tomorrow.  At the funeral
                the preacher said I know how much you'll miss
                him.  How much I'll miss it, she said. He thought
                she meant money, I thought the house she would
                lose, the cooking and polishing she loved, but
                she meant "it," like in novels and poetry about dead
                lovers, how everything apparently ends
                and you're left like her the day after, or him
                the day before, swallowing tablets, stalling, pouring
                foam on their burning hearts, both of them with enough
                pain to last until they died, if they never did.              
                Castles of red brick in the rain, where my
                "Granny" was, who thought the jets flew over
                to take pictures of her clothesline of old
                panties.  Things she said made
                the newspapers: "There," she'd
                say, triumphant, "I TOLD you they were
                listening." From the fireplace.  She could stay
                there till death, or they could cut, a fifty
                fifty chance, the first one.  Downstairs
                at night my father shouted against his
                sisters.  "Be it on YOUR head then," they said.

                He took us to see her, maybe the last
                time, walking into old light
                like yellow dust, lampshades, cracked green
                walls, a room of sofas and steel bars.
                She cried and called him Billy, a
                child, "Take me home."  I looked just
                like him, her Billy.  She wore a flimsy
                flower print, for Sunday, black shoes like a
                witch's, pointed bun of white hair.  Somewhere way
                off inside there was groaning, other crying.

                Your parents always said, "If you don't behave
                we'll send you to Milledgeville."  Now I know
                it was real, where Flannery O'Connor lived
                with her mother and peacocks that called
                like souls at dusk, remember how we
                left her sobbing out "lobotomy" all
                the way back down the hall, and the next
                day, how it showed up in all the papers.
                When we hit that highway in Jacksonville
                a veil parted into an otherness five hundred
                miles and ten days from August's red
                dirt, scrub pine and football
                practice, where my mother wanted
                an athlete, and the coach wanted a state
                championship. Skinny, timid,
                I just wanted a stay of execution
                mixed of crushed bleached shells
                and tar, blown and puddled with white
                sand, running all the way down the coast just
                behind one long dune, a green rampart
                of sea oats and Spanish bayonet, Florida's
                groves of water oak and olive even
                at noon black, clustered, gnarled
                Greek women whispering together, shade
                caves of rusted cutlasses, eye patches, pieces
                of eight falling spangled through twigs
                onto the rooted gray sand carpeted with brown
                scalloped leaves.
                Fronds rattled all night in the salt wind
                and neon palms blinked red, green
                red, green.  Motels, Moorish, Tahitian, flashed
                vacancy, their hula girls flickering hips back
                and forth, the boardwalk over the beach
                pouring pastel candy cotton, apple smells
                and the heavy oil of hamburgers, onions
                corn dogs, boiled crabs. The screaming rides
                calliopes, drowned the hissing of the surf.
                Every morning we drove, our car full
                of coffee steam and canned milk, to the pier
                stilted out over the green waves, its boards
                strewn with translucent pink confetti, bits,
                baby fingernails of shrimp shell and fish scale,
                cobbles of lead sinkers crusted with salt, snarled
                blond nests of old nylon line. We never caught
                anything, but the whole ocean was always there
                in case. And the fishing camp muffled with stained
                sawdust, where we watched the throbbing boats
                come in, throw colored bowed fish, sliding
                in ice slime onto the dock, a shark
                hanging on a hook, its gray bark
                I reached out to touch with one finger
                a dark deep-sea pool with fins
                gliding, giant turtle that raised its beaked
                head to pshaw spray into the warm air above
                where we walked across a wooden bridge afraid
                we were falling through the cracks. It was
                always there, summer after summer the
                same until that last year riding in on the first
                day, there all along, one thing too
                many, a field bulldozed free
                of palms and palmetto, where they practiced
                football, the year I noticed that the blue
                scrolled sign of our motel, the Shangra La,
                was spelled without an "i."
                Every Saturday he was bent
                over the plastic voice of our
                radio, the kitchen filling down
                with the blue smoke of Camels,
                oiled black curls falling
                through the thin fingers that held
                his brow.  They were losing
                again, where they taught about
                flying, or building the planes.
                But his Welsh father would only pay
                for a seminary, until there was
                mother, then the war, then me.
                While I grew up in his father's house
                he delivered telegrams, sometimes
                on campus, came back and told me how
                they all wore yellow satin jackets
                and sliderules on their belts.
                Or went and sat alone at night
                above the grain yellow rink
                he was tall enough to play in.
                When only one college
                would take me, tiny, far
                from home, "No. That's real
                good," he said. "They always
                lose." Which meant to him
                they only took the best.
                Preachers spend half their lives in empty
                churches, stopping by with their sons
                on the way downtown to ball games.  I hear his voice
                far off, echoing, muffled in a small room below --
                he's stained with violet ink, cursing
                the mimeograph machine, or the folder
                that mangles paper.  In the pitiful
                library, I look at Michelangelo's women,
                cracked sepia breasts, plump
                pears between their thighs, the finger
                of naked Adam reaching out to God.

                The summer janitor at thirteen,
                I swept the hundred rooms of concrete
                floors, metal chairs, shredded hymnals,
                gray window light, the silence of stone.
                On the block walls were palm
                trees letting down spears
                of light and Jesus drinking with the woman
                at the well, walking on water, pointing
                to his own heart.  I dreamed of Brenda
                Wilkie, underneath her white choir robe.

                In my worst dreams I'm stranded
                halfway between that red brick, city church
                and home as the sun begins to set.
                I can remember all the turns the car
                used to make to get back into the suburbs,
                but I'm walking and get lost, wander up
                ever more branching roads into the hills past
                the tangled cemetery where my grandmother
                lies, into those neighborhoods where night
                always falls on crumbled roads twisting
                among houses with high
                grass and all the windows dark.
                This is the grave where I buried my
                father, as if he could see blue        
                Kennesaw over there, where Johnston
                dug in like a gentleman to have it
                out, the big gundown, a duel.  Sherman just
                marched around him, cut him off, on
                to Atlanta to burn.  It grew back over, a
                skin, a fur of honeysuckle and kudzu I could
                grow in.  Now each subdivision's
                named something station or
                landing, Civil War chic, new highways
                squirming, red earth sucked to
                the top and bleeding in the rain, that
                K-Mart there in the hill's side as if
                gouged by cannon, the boom of traffic.
                Other than onion rings at The Varsity,
                Brunswick stew at Old Hickory,
                nothing beside remains, though I dream
                my father, on summer nights, ringed
                with shopping centers, sits in the cool
                grass, feels the yellow ghost of honeysuckle, watches
                flares and campfires up on the mountain
                like fireflies, the besieged still holding
                out, praying o
                city that murders my prophets, o
                blue general with fire
                come home.      
                I see the small, boy figure of Gwilym, my
                grandfather, consumptive, climbing out
                of Wales, over and past these gray, bouldered
                hills, away from the black dust toward London
                then onto a ship around the world. Pieces
                are missing, how a cabin boy became
                a cowboy in Australia, came to lay
                rails in America, ending up
                in Georgia's mountains, Methodist
                circuit rider, why aeronautics engineering
                wasn't good enough for Bill his son
                who wanted to fly, that he must become
                another preacher.

                He rebelled too late, a grounded
                accountant marking the soaring of other
                people's money, his crisp two's and
                five's a flock of geese, flight
                of arrows, checks down the long columns.
                At forty he became a preacher so old and self
                taught no church would have him, one voice
                without a wilderness.  Don't make my
                mistake, he said, start early.

                At thirty-five I come back
                to Wales, coal mines gone, to
                wonder if we're meeting, knowing
                ourselves for the first time, strangers
                sharing only a weak chin, small
                mouth and name, or joined deeper
                by an endless ability to hope
                making all three of us lost together.
                There are only a few left, he says,
                kept by old Welsh miners, souvenirs, like
                gallstones or gold teeth, torn
                from this "pit," so cold and wet my
                breath comes out a soul up
                into my helmet's lantern
                beam, anthracite walls running,
                gleaming, and the floors iron-rutted
                with tram tracks, the almost pure
                rust that grows and waves like
                orange moss in the gutters of water
                that used to rise and drown.
                He makes us turn all lights off, almost
                a mile down.  While children scream
                I try to see anything, my hand touching
                my nose, my wife beside me -- darkness palpable,
                a velvet sack over our heads, even the glow
                of watches left behind.  This is where
                they were born, into this nothing, felt
                first with their cold noses for the shaggy
                side and warm bag of black
                milk, pulled their trams for twenty
                years through pitch, past birds
                that didn't sing, through doors
                opened by five-year-olds who sat
                in the cheap, complete blackness listening
                for steps, a knock.  And they
                died down here, generation after
                generation. The last one, when it
                dies in the hills, not quite blind, the mines
                closed forever, will it die strangely?  Will it
                wonder dimly why it was exiled from the rest
                of its race, from the dark flanks of the soft
                mother, what these timbers are that hold up
                nothing but blue?  If this is the beginning
                of death, this wind, these stars?
                I'd never be that
                way, white-haired and prophetic
                stern as Solomon, with full pockets.
                He'd bend over and out would fall
                pens.  He'd pick them up and his
                notebooks would drop, then
                the tiny green Bible. He'd
                bend to pick them up and out would fall
                pens.  Good night alive, he'd shout
                almost a saint except for
                the squatting mimeograph machine
                his own pockets
                and his son.

                And mother liked James Dean, so for years
                it was easy: long hair, leather
                jackets, guitars, anything
                he wasn't.  Until things began
                to fall.  I made sure they were
                cigarettes, small airline
                liquor bottles, prophylactics
                switchblades.

                Graying, I bent groaning today in the new
                asphalt street to tie my
                hushpuppy: the ball of ice
                cream tilted out, then the ball
                point pens, then another ragged
                poem.  I stood with an empty cone
                in the center of the littered black
                street and said God
                damn him, and tried to mean it.
                I'd been there before, knew when I stepped
                off the plane, a hick, into the air-conditioned
                air.  There was smog, yes, but something
                else, a tang -- eucalyptus, burning
                brush in the sun, a cool musk blowing
                off a northern sea that the folds of the desert
                hills poured into, congealing like lava.  The freeways
                bald and ugly, rolled themselves by blue
                waves flecked with the jade pods of kelp, cold
                brine and a beach the color of flesh.  At evening
                crepe myrtle, mimosa, hibiscus, frangipani trailed
                tentacles, scarlet cupped, and the scent of warm
                sage, shades of conquistadors in pewter,
                boulevards of heron-crested palms leaned
                in, all my movies, Saturday matinees, confused:
                Tom Mix zinging bullets off of boulders just
                over the hill from the beast with a million
                eyes, giant ants and the San Andreas
                fault, a lavender stain of sand sliding
                quietly south by San Jacinto like a mountain
                of the moon.  The radio sifted the air
                for a song, "Riders On the Storm," the notes
                flickering stars above Mount Palomar,
                a crowd with candles shouting jump
                to someone on a ledge, white-robed
                congregations at night in blind canyons, lights
                of L.A., a pond of phosphorescent motes seen
                from mountains of coyotes, howling.

                I told no one my vision -- the earth dirty
                dangerous and holy -- except once:
                a group laughing on the beach,
                brown, wet with oil and floured with sand.
                They loved my accent and made me say it over
                and over, like a cowboy star of the thirties
                or something from another world.
                That old cracked couple down the street
                could be Adam and Eve, still, the way
                they tend their fat acre, or the Poe
                story, keeping death out: ramparts of
                azalea, jonquil pikes, corner spumes
                of white dogwood. Maybe death will NEVER
                win, their rich thumbs sprout, grass
                swarm over the mound of grave. So why
                are they afraid? They see it as smut, a mildew,
                something that shows up in
                place of the milkman, sniffing all the
                color from their flowers, slobbering
                all over the jade shrubs, peeing a
                stain in brown runnels of blight through
                the veins and arteries of their tough
                St. Augustine. They even keep its runners
                in, stack their gritty borders with concrete
                block lest something park and watch.
                From their glass breakfast porch they
                would hold each other, shaking free
                fists at it, they way they cross to the
                other side when they pass my rented yard
                with its plastic chair among the dead
                leaves, broken limbs and bicycles
                in the shadow of the shaggy copper
                beech that has been rust from the beginning.                    
                On the road past Lake Serene, someone
                has torn down the bridge out
                sign, and while pickups doze in the blacktop
                lots of shouting south Mississippi
                churches, we drive on across concrete
                spillways, our tires hushed in water,
                looking at the mansions and the leaves
                until we come to the new bridge of broken
                white wafers down in the red gorge
                the lake seeps through to become a stream
                again.

                Since we have to stop
                anyway, we get out to look for pine cones
                to fill Christmas baskets. Fresh
                fallen from the storm last night they're
                hard, unopened, pink as flesh, long
                thin pineapples. Like crusts of bread
                they lead us along the bluff, layered
                like orange desert cliffs, and around
                to the lake, the shallow end away
                from the yachts and boat docks, to where
                mud has cracked in autumn's low water.

                Now a grid of slick gray tiles
                furred with evergreen lies beneath
                clear water only inches deep.  Mussels,
                fat brown parabolas etched with rings
                like trees, bubble between the cracks.
                On the shore, in sand, we see tracks of
                raccoon, watching us from the pine
                dark woods, and the shells they've
                beaten open with both paws and left
                in the sun to be pearl butterflies
                everywhere. Out in the lagoon, navy,
                rippled with the cold north wind, are
                thousands of logs, stumps, each
                knobbed with turtles.

                Back at the car we thump
                the pine cones into the trunk
                and open a mussel, part the thin
                lips to show us something inside:
                wet, soft, curled like a small
                tongue of glycerin and amber.
                I'm taking apart a packing
                crate in the back yard, building
                a bookcase of the pieces, hoping
                my wife will come back and see
                what I was, though I've told her
                often enough.  It must be the smell
                of pine, the scraps we burned
                in barrels, shivering, climbing in the
                morning out of the purple shadow up
                on that beached skeleton of yellow
                bones, the heaped mud below us flecked
                with nails, into the parallel gold
                bars of sun above the trees, slippery
                rime on the boards, glistening
                snail tracks, until the sun
                thawed it to damp the wood a shade
                darker, pulpy as stale bread
                to the nails, ringing slightly when
                you let the hammer do the work, if
                you're good, just lifting it
                to fall, going in deep with one
                blow, the boards blond as women, lime
                streaked with grain, powdered with the fine
                dust our saws give off into the morning
                like pollen. Splinters, and drops
                of blood like blots of rust. Insects
                grow louder as the sun rises. We
                throw aluminum cans of water
                underarmed, lateraled like
                footballs, silver bullets twirling, throwing
                off curls of the water that tastes
                like sugar, metal cold in the throat.

                She comes around the house bringing lemonade
                and stays to watch.  I begin to tell the story again
                as things start to bend and tear.
                I begin to sweat, saying
                I used to ...
                do this ...
                for a living
                but my story, like this project
                is going nowhere, and she yawns.
                Your stories go nowhere
                too, I say, the famous
                England trip, hiking in the Rockies,
                the alleged year you spent as a waitress, you,
                who've broken every dish in the house.
                But she just laughs and goes
                back in.

                Now the nails straighten again
                by themselves and sink into the wood
                forever, shining, hidden.
                They make fun of our spoiling her, felt
                catnip toys, canned escargot, a tiny
                wine list.
                But her forerunner got hit chasing
                squirrels in the street because we wanted her
                to be free, happy, the one we raised
                by hand with a doll's bottle she sucked
                and chewed, her blind mouth brimming
                with evaporated milk.  She made a nest
                in my hair at night, and I had fleas
                for months, long after she was dead.

                This one wears a harness and leash
                she drags around the yard all day
                like a small, abandoned sled dog.
                Most of the time she just sits, miserable
                humiliated, as if she's being forced to wear
                a hat.  We keep a broomstick
                handy for dogs and snakes.

                They only live ten or twelve years
                anyway, at the most,
                but we want to bury her wrinkled
                arthritic, bored
                though she sits for hours thinking, scheming
                of a breakout, dreaming
                of mice and trashcans
                hating our guts.

                We could care less: we don't
                philosophize
                anymore -- we just
                patrol.
                "But I don't love HIM.  I love
                YOU."  I turned to see her
                within the morning shade of a small
                tree, standing as if she'd just
                stamped her foot, arms crossed, holding
                together her trembling yellow dress.
                His head was bowed.  They were being
                miserable, but o what
                misery.  The butler, I walked
                on.  Hadn't heard a thing.

                Though it's still warm, fall
                has begun, the sun already
                slanting in the afternoon, flaring
                the brick buildings orange and gold, one
                or two leaves turning early, here a dot
                of russet, mauve.  The evenings are
                sentimental, smells of woodsmoke and something
                invisible just beginning, blooming
                too late.  Hearing winter, sick
                cats push at my window tonight
                to be fed, broken-winged birds
                struggle out in the dark, fish with
                eyes hooked sink, their scales releasing
                the summer moon.  Wounded things
                begin to ache before it snows and all
                the books I've ever read weigh tons,
                and that's outside the mind.
                I've never been this far above
                the earth as now returning to the city
                of my birth. Far off to the south out
                the plate glass window of the fifty-seventh
                floor, the red brick project where I was
                conceived, across the street the college
                my father couldn't afford, the jade pool
                of football field where I sold cokes.  How
                appropriate it would be to die here on this
                brief and single visit above it all, remember
                fires on T.V., hotels like this burning like
                matches, all smoke alarms and sprinklers
                no comfort.  I imagine air bags like biscuits
                down in the street, if I could hit one, aim
                straight enough, have the courage to
                jump and live, or die.  Before sleep I pray:
                for the one I left for no good reason, that I don't
                fall, for the two orphans my sister adopted then
                gave up when she left her husband, if they're still
                out there somewhere below me in the dark, three
                of the lights theirs.  To sleep I imagine catching
                passes, but feel no earth beneath my feet only
                the hum of this tower in wind, dream only of
                falling.  As I dress to go home, dawn
                reddens the city like a dig in Pompeii so that I
                could step out into it, kneel and brush with one
                finger from the streets between cinnamon
                roofs red dust to find within one brick doll's house
                my mother, still curled on her first bed afraid
                that if she gets up the seed won't
                take.  I pull from my coat the long
                blond hair of my wife remembering
                Lawrence's mother, how her one white strand floated
                up the chimney into nothing.  From my pants
                I brush the short gray hairs from my own
                head, the pale banded filaments of cats.
                They all float down to the floor
                of the fifty-seventh floor.  Outside
                clouds are forming, coming toward me as if
                I were one of them, one of those souls
                that fly up like clouds out of the dead, or the just
                beginning to be.
                I was a child again.
                In the park a girl
                with blond hair watched only
                me.  I could tell she loved me.
                Dream children are lamed so
                they can't follow you home,

                but I got lost, ankles in
                sawdust when the barker stopped me, towering
                above, pointing to the tent side painted
                with the giraffe people, the woman rose
                tattooed, then the green tiny
                earth in a blue pond circled by some
                kind of blond bird on a string.  Blood
                red caption: Mandolin Music in Space!
                You flew my kite.  Blood
                red silk formed a rose,
                the green stem a tail.
                It nodded in the wind all day,
                a lily tethered in a stream
                I watched until dark when

                passion made us grow: lying
                in grass we strained lips, limbs like
                giraffes for leaves, twined
                necks, became
                a tower on the hill.  Silence
                haunted this desire,
                though ghosts, wind, and the wings
                of birds whispered.
                They are splayed in front of me
                like a new hand of cards, thirty
                each bending to the topic, the major
                problem facing college
                freshmen, and I wonder what
                on earth I would write, probably
                remember first the second
                semester, chosen to room with the one
                they all adored, filling
                the shower with guitar chords
                and steam, sitting up on the gravel
                roof and watching cars from the late
                shift at the quarry go home, running
                naked to steal honeysuckle from
                the dean's bush and piling it high
                on the desk we never used, the others
                coming by just to smell it, closing
                back the door without a word until
                it faded, brown tendrils limp, jade
                leaves dusty, the window open in the spring
                afternoon blowing scent and cream flowers
                down the hall.  Singing hits all night
                "The Bright Elusive Butterfly of Love,"
                "Did You Hear the Lonesome Whipporwill,"
                sleepers beating time on our walls, the house
                mother almost crying, you've got to stop singing
                that bird song.  We laughed at her
                and swaggered off through half a year.

                But of the first I would write only of
                my father leaving me there, a room
                in a house so dark I dreamed
                only of death, hiding in the basement
                of the dorm, and then home at
                Christmas, riding to the hospital, moaning
                over and over, not she doesn't
                love me anymore, but "alone"
                over and over, surprised
                as if this was all I'd learned
                or how people only love the people
                they won't let themselves have
                or that from out of where you cut your
                arms what there is of you to hurt
                passes forever like blood leaving
                white tubes that don't need anything
                just to go on writing how I somehow
                still sit each night on top of that house
                watching the night shift wind like pairs
                of stars down that hill, around
                that house that is alone, on the hill
                that is still alone in that country
                on this same old earth that always
                hangs in the night until it's time
                to hand these papers in and go home.
                Four hours from the city
                is a way through the first forest.
                Within a tunnel of trees
                moccasins and oxen hooves
                walked it down until the land around
                makes walls laced with roots.
                Paved with leaves the road
                dips to cross streams pebbled
                like separate trails we walk
                in all directions, barely
                wetting our feet.  We
                see raccoon tracks two
                by two, the twin blades of shy
                deer spoor, red squirrels boring
                deep into the boles of trees turning
                gold, fogged blue in the morning
                with the smoke of the hardwood
                fires of our waking, shivering
                to pack up and go.
                Tomorrow the leaves will be one shade
                brighter, changing all the cold night
                for us, at home, angry again.
                We were camping.  He
                came out of the woods, thin, scarred
                shivering as he walked. We fed him
                spaghetti, salami, stale
                bread he ate till almost dead and buried
                the rest, knowing winter, how
                no one comes to sleep by the lake.

                We found wood to burn in a grove
                of oak, cut and left to rot.
                He stayed in darkness, beyond the fire.
                Headlights came at midnight, halloing.
                He cowered as if the voice were over him
                with a stick. We kept
                quiet, hiding, but the pickup
                came down, asking about a liver-spotted
                hound.  Seeing the twelve-gauge, we said no
                dog here.
                When we left he ran after us
                partway up the road.

                Today it is full winter, gray and drizzling, even
                up on that acre of rotting trees, on that
                lake where no one comes but hunters
                calling home their dogs.
                I stalk the nature trail
                trying to see deer
                or even a rabbit.
                The leaves still wet
                I creep like moccasins
                when suddenly I hear
                something coming
                on the trail ahead.
                Had I a rifle
                I'd have shot a young
                doppelganger, red bandannaed.
                He says as we pass
                you think you're alone out here?
                You've got a surprise coming
                about a hundred yards up.

                About a hundred yards up
                a hundred boy scouts are waking
                screaming, chasing through the woods
                casting lures into trees
                burning bacon.
                A scoutmaster, mounty cap crooked
                on his head
                sits wrapped in a khaki blanket
                his face sleeping in his hands while
                green and yellow tents sag everywhere
                radios twang and clumsy
                fires pour up blue smoke.
                I used to beg my mother
                to let me join, go on these trips,
                but she thought I was too frail.
                Old as the scoutmaster
                I am finally learning to camp
                dreaming in my tent of grizzlies
                burning my fingers
                chopping my feet.

                I see one trying to fill
                a plastic jug with a two-handed pump.
                He looks alone here, not a member
                of anybody's gang.
                I hold the jug like a
                scoutmaster would while he
                pumps and tells me about the hike
                they took yesterday so long even
                MY feet begin to ache.
                We fill the jug, look
                at his blisters,
                tighten up his tent and then
                sit down by his smudge of fire.
                Glad of the company
                he offers me black bacon
                and a slice of toast
                spread with cold butter
                and ashes like pepper.

                When I leave he goes to show
                the way I'd lost, pointing
                from the fork we come to
                and is still there, smaller
                standing in a spot of sun
                at the first bend before I go
                into the deepest part of the woods.
                Fishing, our lanterns hung just
                above the slick black water made
                holes filled with fish, squirming
                eels in a barrel of yolk.
                Offshore, the oil rigs crouched,
                steel mosquitoes, their needles
                syphoning out the long dead
                and fishing boats inside the reef
                illegally, running lights off
                used the moon instead rising
                red and swollen through air sifted
                with volcanic ash.
                Dolphins in the bay circled and charged
                again and again with ivory teeth
                into the shoals of trout
                busy snapping minnows and shrimp
                on the surface, and sometimes
                our hooks that
                snagged them up to beat
                off their scales on the loose
                gravel of the bridge
                with the bloody moon rising
                over hooks and nets everywhere, things
                leaping into hoops of light appearing
                almost glad to die.
                Each day they try to hold the island
                that's moving, folding, crawling like an octopus
                back to mainland.  Finger paring, it's dissolving
                to the invisible quick.  Bulldozer noise is a
                surf, choppers hover with the gulls.
                The beach is fished out this year from
                mud-dredge and a hard freeze.  Up here
                on the night bridge fewer than ever come
                to lanterns pasting a jade ball on the tidal
                river, hanging mosquitoes for minnows, then shrimp
                flipping for trout: first the first of their
                flash, then shades weaving the falling tide
                someone down the bridge, their bending down
                face, reflected yellow moon, whispering there
                they are, here rising, here sperm
                squirming in a yolk, snapping foam.  They
                hover, seem to be swimming like hounds ran
                back when there were foxes, if you caught in
                helicopter searchlight their streaming from
                the spool, forming, flattening to take a
                hedge, thinning like water through rocks
                spinning filaments through trees, resuming
                the skein on the other side, not running but
                riding land-flow beneath.  This is how they
                hold the tide, though the rigs offshore
                flare their gas-burn wells, illegal black-boats
                drag their trawls, how they will come back
                every night to our lamps for years
                even when they is only one left
                or one light left to come to.
                It's New Orleans but it isn't.
                There's no heat, no black mud levee
                just cool jade grass declining
                to the clear Mississippi, cobalt
                blue flowing so shallow over sand
                that we can wade across.
                And trees everywhere, but no houses
                only small grocery stores in the groves
                of water oak, in the shade of Spanish moss
                with formica tables where old friends
                can sit and drink beer
                who haven't seen each other for years.
                Some of us are even dead
                so that we could easily cry
                about this last chance
                except we're shy and speak only
                of how much weight we've lost
                how good we still look.

                We know we are only dreaming
                have met in a nexus of time and night
                so why, as we talk, explain, apologize, do we
                smile with a secret, as if
                summoned to this heaven by
                our need for each other again
                as if one of us sent out a call?
                By the river on the night of the twenty-fifth
                and don't be late.
                You were born into it, certitude, like the air
                you came into, waiting to breathe, the lemon
                color of your hair, the teeth you assumed.
                Everything after fell in line -- a white horse
                high stepping to Gary Owen," a wife
                who needed you like bread, the eyes               
                of a country. You knew -- looking
                at women, drawing a bead, or an ace,
                but unsatisfied, itchy, there was still a catch
                a skip, still in the breast, a
                stutter, priming your heart, turning
                the head at odd moments, expecting
                a door, something to enter, go through.
                And then you saw your first indian
                and finally showed that famous smile
                everything around you dead.
                I've been there when five
                have tied a game, pistol
                hands going off, revolution,
                emotion rising to the dome like fog, tear
                gas, red ants swarming.

                Only tenors and athletes get that
                instant backwash, echo of greatness
                slapped from a cliff face
                back, the ball, high C
                going through touching nothing
                at all.

                What about Keats then, just
                after, say, the Grecian
                Urn, nobody, nothing but a sagging
                candle, there that late. Old
                silence.  Or maybe the sound when
                silence is shifted one cog over
                by a poem, as though you'd turned
                the wheel left, went right
                and for a second
                where are you?

                As if the wrought iron bench,
                beneath you in the sunny side-
                walked, bird, bicycle, new
                leaved, skates and flowered
                park, its lion paws set
                in warm concrete that twines steel
                tap roots down, were
                by a single thought just
                ever so slightly
                moved.                                                  
                I stopped praying years ago, learned how
                to think instead of love, or the icy mountains before
                death, green fields beyond.  Now I need
                a quiet god, not to make the heart rattle,
                a golf ball in a cup.  Baseball fits best,
                almost as if designed in sleep:  the pickoff, brush
                back, squeeze, suicide squeeze, stealing.  It's no
                heaven -- it's here: slick skin and stitches of the ball
                in hand reminding me of Ebba St. Claire, Atlanta
                Cracker catcher built like crossed trees, showing us
                how to throw, the ball an egg in the knotted
                roots of his fingers. If he never made it, how
                can we?  Yet I wear before sleep the welts
                and wrinkles of a glove, dream hand, grip the bone
                handle of a Louisville Slugger, slap clay
                from my spikes and go toward the dark as to
                home, playing for the bunt, the sacrifice.
                Before this happened, God
                was something inside, familiar, warm
                as an organ. Now it's far
                away, white-haired and thunderous,
                a dirt dam I plug stormy nights
                on my knees that sickness won't
                balloon into death, that accidents
                swerve and carom around us, the vessel
                in my wife won't burst, my heart
                get sulky and tired, the wrong woman
                show up.

                All good tragedies are those of
                love, and therefore God, inside of us
                yet still outside, like dreams
                of dams bursting overhead, tornadoes
                circling, things, rising from dark
                swamps, red eyed, taloned, coming closer.
                We see her in the K-Mart housewares department
                buying an o god no, and look away
                fast, one of those freak accidents, the way drunken
                cowboys pass out in the middle
                of a west Texas prairie night, the sun
                spotting their bondoed pickups neatly
                on the rails until the once-a-week express
                slices their dreams in half. But this is trying
                to be art, this poem, imitate her life
                better than it's been imitating Modern
                Romances -- twitching a blonde coed across
                the path of her lying hound of a husband.
                So now, just a little too late to start
                over, she'll step out of her house of new
                kids onto her new K-Mart
                doormat, and her own sidewalk's
                banana peel will skid her
                into the street to kiss the Mack
                truck that's been coming down through the language
                for years. I bet they find one of her pink jogging shoes
                almost a mile away.
                Harry, Hilary, John, I get
                the names all wrong, say them for
                good morning, see their smiles
                sag and disappear.  Later I know
                I've called them wrong, as if
                I didn't know or care. And how
                can I go back and make it up, make it
                good?  Tell them what is wrong and always
                was, how often I hear fuses shorting
                and snapping, see only a question
                mark of smoke puff from a gray box
                on the house's white side, how it hangs
                and blows away in morning wind
                into green, the spring trees
                lime-green and thick?  How I dream, names
                changed, Philip my wife losing her fine
                dark hair, Mary my mother, bearded, or
                Don with her breasts, my dead father who comes
                tired to me each night, the one I
                embrace saying lover, friend?
                I've seen too many, interviews
                where they remember exactly forever
                what they were doing when it
                happened.  I had just opened a)
                the door b) a beer c) my Bible
                to Deuteronomy when I heard the
                explosion/growl/roar like a freight train,
                thud like thunder shaking the house.
                Where were we when Kennedy was shot?
                Where was Sheila Grahame but in the kitchen,
                Scott standing by the mantelpiece, taking
                out a carton of milk, lighting
                a cigarette.  So I keep trying this way to live
                as if each moment were the last: now I'm
                putting on my shorts.  I had just put on
                my shorts.  The way you run a tape forward
                to the good parts, what came just before and
                who cares what just after.  There's a part of
                Jamaica so rough all the men wear their black
                sharkskins striped with the slick ebony of razor
                welts.  They call it we no send, you
                no come from the days they rode back
                to back, two
                to a horse, the front one always saying how
                he heard the thump, then the shot itself just
                as he'd turned the bend.  "But all I saw was where
                I was going.  And the poor
                bastard never even knew where he was, only where
                he'd been."  And maybe this is the way we keep
                leaving each day, each moment, as if we'd never
                been, except for the one where we must
                stay, like getting off at a station or bend that will
                be that second forever, for us and for the other
                left to remember just what they were doing
                when they turned and we were gone.
                For a long time I kept dreaming
                my wife died suddenly.  She'd step
                on a board that would crack and down
                she'd go, getting smaller, my heart
                with her, mouth still trying to say
                even the first syllable of her name.
                I would never know it was coming: we'd
                be in England walking a castle wall, she'd
                step out on some scaffolding to rescue
                a kitten before I could stop her.  Or onto
                a slick green stone in the river above
                falls.  And then she really almost did, one
                second fishing by me in the sun, then
                the emergency room, the doctor saying
                something's certainly going on in there.
                Inside you laugh like a bad step on a gravel
                roof.  Then a step to right yourself
                that doesn't hold.  But you were gone from
                the first, that slight sway from dead
                center to where gravity is waiting: Walesa
                on the high wire in the wind, dropping his
                pole then himself like an ice cream cone, the space
                shuttle, another bottle rocket.  Or you try to split
                the difference between two semi's slamming like
                doors: the silence while you ride limp as a rag
                the crest of a wave, watching the spot where
                you'll hit, heart beating fastest just before
                it stops.  Movies make it almost leisurely:
                the bullet smacks, you reel, wobble, spin,
                stagger, fall in someone's arms.  They hold
                your head while you name
                names: trap door, banana peel, frog tongue.
                What is it after all but a
                judgement, a pronouncement?  Someone has to say
                "He's dead," and someone always does, but
                if they are still here, that is, the body, then
                they are still here. Eyes closed, perhaps
                heart stopped, of course. But what if no one
                said it, made that decision?  We would
                notice a lapse of words, a slight
                slumping of the body, a pause
                in the air of the room.  We would
                go on talking until, tired, we
                went home, calling their house out of habit
                for years. If we badly needed to know what
                only they knew, like the name of an
                obscure actor, or a book, we
                could go to them and ask. Until it got too
                ugly. Eventually, every thought of them would trip
                on the certainty: that where they were
                there was still silence.  We would stop
                going, stop calling.
                This is death then. Not them, not their
                decaying, as we all do, or their
                thinking deep in the eyes as if quiet
                for some reason, but only
                us, our giving up.
                When the doctor told me
                I went to the bathroom
                sat down and wept on the tall
                toilet for the sick and dying.
                Wept.  Crying's for babies, mashed
                thumbs, not for the world like
                a bruised grape or a fisted
                eye.  The tile room filled slowly up
                with grief, a roar in
                my ears, submarine.  But as low
                as I was, you were still below
                me, sedated, sleeping, or talking
                with eyes closed, beyond
                pain, sinking, wrapped
                in white, your hair a coral fan
                on the pillow.  All I wanted
                to tell you, serious, desperate from that
                height was my love and guilt, something you,
                growing deeper, darker, already
                didn't need, the vein into
                that pale, floating arm a tether
                to your new current
                leaving me to drown for years.
                You came uninvited, a stark
                and slimy, inconvenient thing
                we couldn't throw out,
                two romantics as we are.
                So we raise you in this sty,
                this poverty without hope
                of prospects or college
                only words and food from cans.
                You'll hate my guts,
                I knew that from the beginning.
                Maybe you'll even be the one
                to finally punch me out, split my lip
                when I pitch a fit, screaming
                at your mother.  You'll yell
                you selfish pig, and I'll turn
                and play my ace, saying
                coldly, levelly
                I never wanted you.
                But for now I walk you
                back and forth at 2 a.m.

                Angry at this intrusion on my
                liquor, late movies, and poems
                I shake you a little too hard.
                But you don't cow
                you just wrinkle in your red face
                and blow a scream
                back at me, already letting
                into my mouth
                the bitterness of blood.
                My world isn't hers, skin
                like mocha she climbs
                into each morning, air pouring
                through her throat clear
                as creekwater, no line where
                brown legs slide into
                silk shorts.  She's my student
                but I'm in class now, aerobics,
                flunking in a room of convex
                mirrors and dumbbells, though
                she's patient, pities me, the
                sounds I make for air.  It's
                hopeless as a dancing bear, Disney
                hippo in a tutu, a friend's
                father.  She wants to pop
                candy in my mouth when I do
                something right.  Cigarettes
                smell like burning celery, liquor
                is shellac, her heart has a slow
                beat and sticks to it, she can bench press
                me.  I sort of pity HER, daughter
                I never had, how far she has
                to go, how dirty and heavy.
                But she's perfect now, and even
                her hard music gets under my
                fat, sets my frog leg jumping
                in jean stores.
                She's working hard to get me young
                I'm aging her fast
                and three times a week
                we keep meeting here.
                My old fishing buddy calls to ask
                if I still want that skull, that a guy's
                in town selling them at a plastic
                surgeons' convention.  Forty to two
                hundred dollars each, depending on
                how many teeth are left unbroken.
                He buys in India but will have to stop
                in August, a new law.  I tell him
                no, that that was when I thought death
                was cute, like Sarah Bernhardt, with her Hamlet
                prop and sleeping every night in
                a coffin, before all those hours in  
                the hospital doing crosswords, afraid to read
                a novel in case I ran across words like
                "love, " or "alone," or "wife." Before she
                opened her eyes and said it looks like you're finally
                going to be free.  Or before I quit
                smoking and started jogging because the man
                in the next room, gross and wheezing, was swelling
                every day, slowly exploding like something already
                dead in the sun. Before I found out I was happy and
                always have been.  Pretty soon, my friend says,
                all skulls will be plastic, and we talk
                about fishing again in the Gulf, how
                we're going to stand waist deep in that jade
                water, how we're going to bust those trout, really
                put ants on them, how we're going to let them go.
                All those commercials pushing zest, out
                lusting each other for life.  Soon they'll come
                on holding a can and have a fit, as if last
                second a million beings hadn't died.
                There. Another legion, souls fizzing
                from cancers like tire air, an extra
                thousand little brown balloons gone
                from the lands where the dirt is cracked
                like lips.  Next second or the next a billion
                bugs will conclude, applauded from
                this life, round off incarnations, they
                hope, fireflies shush into dark like matches
                in water, small animals furred and shelled just
                pop on the highways, champagne
                corks on the edge of a new
                year that's always happening, interstates
                of hearts stopping, seizing black engines
                out of oil.  Slugged bodies falling down
                the sky, bulldozed, floating up, blood
                vessels puffing and splitting, but you'd never
                know by watching television, which is why
                they talk about life being such a wonderful
                thing, and it is, at least mine is.
                After I hit thirty, I found
                I began looking forward to it, even
                the cartoon lion saying floss
                only the teeth you want to keep.
                He tells me they use it to string
                agate beads it's so strong.  The needle
                is somewhere in my head, the cobra
                cyclops peering at me over his
                shoulder, war of the worlds.
                The pain hides like a pin
                in a haystack in the next
                county, but will come back later
                with drums.  I give off dust like
                a quarry and his fingers smell
                like Dachau.  Outside, air comes
                into my mouth half cold, half
                hot, and my ringing right ear
                hears me from across the room
                thanking him around the oyster
                of my tongue, lisping that while pain
                is good this is better.
                A long time we've known
                each other. I worried how
                thin you were, how chalky
                soft your bones, so ugly, sharp
                nose, tiny mouth like a carp's, weak
                chin. We grew apart because
                you couldn't keep up.
                But you did keep calling, sometimes
                drunk, long distance, your whining
                bad lungs whistling, another sore
                that wouldn't heal, a new growth
                ballooning, your heart heavy as a black
                anvil in a crate of ribs, twinges
                like blue thorns on cold vines
                lacing through your arms, in
                your ears the noise of crickets
                in dry grass.  I listened to your fear
                just the way I did when I cared.
                But now your calls wake me like stabs
                in the dark. I turn on the lamp to tell you
                before hanging up, turning back
                off the light, if you're going to go,
                go.
                I've been there.  In another room a woman
                laughs, but the lime-green
                fields are rice, the black clouds
                monsoons coming across the Bay
                of Bengal whipping orange
                saris along the plain of beach, a
                temple ruined in jade, vines
                strung with red monkeys, stones
                of steps going down into
                the brown Ganges, white cattle
                in the streets, golden curry, woman's
                violet lips, that forehead spot, third eye.

                A boy, stinging their flanks
                with a bamboo pole drives water
                buffalo at dusk, a man walking
                with a smiling girl traces
                something with his hands -- a passion, a
                memory:gray moss above a black
                river, snakes with the marks
                of diamonds, red dust, cotton.
                In my other life, I stayed
                up all night, in charge of the moon
                in the clearing, where the sticks
                got up and
                joined hands and
                danced.
                I had a crown of clover and baby's breath
                and sweet minions
                and I presided sitting on a soft
                mushroom, drinking moonshine
                from an acorn cup till dawn
                when I was put to snore between the roots
                of a great tree.
                This went on for three hundred years
                and I died.

                I woke up human, and Baptist, in Atlanta, Georgia --
                which shows you what can happen
                when you don't pay attention.
                The Indians say, it's a good day
                to die: grass smelling like
                watermelon, wind blowing yellow
                flour.  I sign a pink
                tissue that will swear if I drop
                dead it's no one's fault but my
                own, unsaid the mountains of butts
                and bottles, the doctor pitying
                me like a sinner -- he's brown
                and spare as a monkey or
                astronaut.  Young girl-jocks in
                ballet tights paste their soft
                leeches to my chest, and the treadmill
                narrow as a beam starts flowing, waits
                for no man.  Out flows the plastic
                paper of my every second, peaks,
                and valleys when the body pauses,
                debates like a fist whether ever
                to open again, pull in like a swimmer
                before the breast's stroke.  Soon
                the leather river has beaten me, I'm
                winded.  "Are you through," she says.
                They wrap the tape around my ruby
                vial of blood and I leave knowing
                the results as I walk toward
                home, looking, like a man
                for his keys, for anything
                else, one more
                image: maybe that old
                car, its cushion sticking
                from the bottom slit of the door,
                caught like a tongue.
                Hang on to these. Someday
                you may need them. Say you think
                she looked at you like a god, that
                dresses were orange, flowers yellow,
                eyes blue grass green gazebo
                white brass band red. Or when
                exactly was it?  Then, you say, no,
                Sunday she says, so you find our
                packet you have carefully saved,
                Your Memories Enclosed. See?
                It's the rolling-in clouds that
                are yellow, your face green.  Brass
                flowers, she is blue. Red
                lightning forks behind your
                unfocused face, it's too dark,
                some shadow gestures, which she turns
                to touch like a god, you were old
                and alone like you are now but don't
                remember it that way, so you look
                deep into the amber negatives for your
                self.  The squares are empty as Sunday morning.
                Thank you for your order.
                I was hungry, we all were hungry
                the world was defined by hunger.
                There was wire
                round in our skulls
                and coiled in stomachs.
                They gave us something for the body
                our minds were worse.

                In England
                as I walked my fingers
                brushed the bindings
                which never seem to end.

                Though sirens divide the night
                my bed is empty
                my body invisible
                smiles at the black sentry.

                What I learn
                I let go
                with the wind
                and the wind goes over the wire.
                It starts with little things --
                a blue web belt from the Navy,
                a book of the greatest chess games,
                a boy scout knife with ten blades.
                You suspect that this time
                they have not been lost, or mislaid, or left somewhere,
                but subtracted,
                that something has begun
                erasing,
                like cyphers, like tracks,
                the curios of your history
                starting back at the first
                and gaining on you every day.
                When you begin to miss certain people,
                you know the house itself is next
                or the street of green trees.
                One morning when you wake it will be
                color
                and you will wander for days in snow
                before, suddenly, even the whiteness goes.
                But by then it will be
                just one more thing.

Milkweed is pertinent now, so in the air
That everyone is thinking in its terms.
The housewife doesn't dare hang out the wash
Without considering milkweed; engineers
Decide today to redesign the air
Filters they thought perfected. It's a fact:
Milkweed has come to live and be lived with.

Reprieved, the birds have ceased to pluck their breasts
To line their nests -- though few enough are still
Fixing for eggs when milkweed begins to hatch
Exploding from the brown sun-brittled pods.
Occasional nestlings get mistaken meals,
Beakfuls of milkweed someone took for bugs:
Like anything in the air, it seems all things

Eventually: a faery's shuttlecock
As soon as seeds blown from the plainest plant.
Step in a cataract of light on a day
Like this, look up and see another race
Cast from its place and looking for its place;
Riding the wind toward distant, solid ground,
They scatter golden light on their scattered way.

In the park behind the meetinghouse
the Cambridge Quakers glow on the round walk;
summer suits and dresses in discrete procession,
family after separate family passes
among trellissed leaves
up the stone steps faithful still to the memory
of the night's dew,
dazzled and eased again at every stair.

The pointillist Quakers
flicker between the branches,
file past the sunken court where Longfellow,
head and shoulders, presides
over slabs and benches patterned by the light's
unhurried pointing
of branches turned through the summer day.

The sun is stirring this bowl of stones;
it simmers the day until the flecks of yellow
seem fixed on the stairs, set
before the feet of the unbuttoned Quakers
leaving the meetinghouse;
the saffron frocks flare and cotton jackets
flash over shoulders impatient
with the settled patterns of the walk
and branches turning slowly
certain on a Sunday afternoon.

All my intelligence of beasts:
Inklings of men.

How the childhood dog can turn
Sudden as a fuse
(Never my dog, but she
Sainted all eighteen years),
The camel's back break.

How the cheetah who is not
The strongest cat in town
Dragging home antelope
Glares mad into brush from side to side.

I know the housecat's lust for looking-glass,
Dolphins' for speech through a sounding sea.

Most clear of all it is
That to the great wet eye of a horse, standing
Across the fence like one to gossip with,
That sky is not called blue nor even sky:

I and another sort of animal
Have circled slowly with a closed
Impassive room as referee,
Sat and stared through eyes at eyes
Like lovers
An equal distance from the door.

On the window-sill across the alley
there are always shoes, old shoes
with tall thick heels. The old woman
rotates them like crops; every pair
is black, scuffed gray.
                                  At night
her television blares across to us.
Its gray light affronts the moon.

One afternoon while the light turned gold
my wife was bringing in from the fire escape
our rose bush in its redwood tub.
The woman's face glimmered above the shoes
and called out, 'Where are you taking
my garden?'
                    Tonight
she is a shape like a heap of stone fruit
in that flickering light, waiting
for God to come on and tell her
the sacrifice is approved, the shoes
will ascend tomorrow in a golden shaft.

But this evening, when the foxfire
ages the shoes and freezes the old woman,
I put my book down and lean toward the window
and pray that God will leave the shoes,
unpolished, filled heel to toe with good loam
and thick with violets drinking the moonlight.

One waits in the cold and thinks,
Waiting must end;
The bus must come, or love, the equinox.
And love or bus or equinox may come
In fact:
Not through machina of desire.
To bear the wait
Suddenly grown unbearable, one shifts
In irritation, acquiescence, finds
A new stance of waiting
Or of not waiting,
Standing merely under the sky.

The bus one seeks in the east may come
Bounding out of the south,
Fracturing southern sky.
The sky was molten yesterday that now
Solidifies and darkens, lumped and gouged.
Trees stick up into the holes and shiver.
They look as lost as amputated threads
Between two layers of velvet, one of which
Was sold this morning. Someone prepares a dress
For early spring. It matches the close felt
Gray on young antlers. It is nearly done.
Then she will lean to meet the trees' caress
When the days fit the nights like a new pelt.
Everything rhymes with spring.
All comes, all fits,
Not with the cling of winter mist;
The gold the eye has
Tried to deduce from limbering skies
Thrusts from the other heaver as
The crocuses' appropriate surprise.

Summer, and the strings of guitars
go flat in their cases.
The living gut relaxes in its case,
and we eat little.
Surrounded by the buzz of flies and fans
our thoughts thicken. We sit,
eyes sore with rubbing away the sun,
staring out the window at passersby,
and wonder, should we try to sleep
the flat afternoon away? Nothing solidifies.

Once there was power in summer
unlocking in our limbs
to swim, to make waves,
to reach floats moored far out
to scale tall trees
a current in the fingers
to bring the guitars up to pitch
and set flies to rout with the buzz
of brisk Spanish dances.

Delicate fire ran in our limbs.
It was verve
beyond our winters, it lay between us,
sucking us together.
It drew us into figures
beyond ourselves.

Now there is nothing more antique
than the sullen weight of limbs.
Pedestrians amble below our eyes,
we do not follow. The boxes
stay in their cases.
Nothing dances.

He steps to the porch and squints out
as if these were his father's lands
again. Crows freckle the far elms.

He is alone, gun his only prop.
Dog's dead, flung bloated into the field,
now dry as the dry field's furrows: leather thing.

Crows wait in bleachers of elm.
This would be harvest time, on other lands.
The gun too has outlived its purpose.

Sky has clapped shut over this space.
It waits for a word which will not be spoken,
holds its own breath back from elms,

back from dog's crusted fur, from ground's
dead dust, holds it for a gesture
nobody's going to make.

Crows wait too. They do not cry out.
Man does not raise his gun.
Dog doesn't smile.

Seabury's Sermons, 1793,
1798, 1815,
in crumbling leather stand in gold and burn
slowly in sunlight. Around the Anglican
the British church refused to consecrate
first Bishop in America, the dust
dancing attendance on the living light
attests the revolutions of the earth.

If all this dust is only dust
then nothing means a thing except the thing
itself -- unless the eye of God . . . unless . . .

If reading is the ground
where inference and implication meet
then sculptor, farmer and geologist
meeting upon that ground may read the rocks,
enrich the rocks, may found the stone firmly
to bear its weight in height and breadth and depth
in the mansion of the human universe,
and dust may be the finest earth.

In the Inn my great-aunt's great-great-uncle built,
here in the kitchen where the women baked
the daily staff and on the distaff spun
the thread the children measured and the men
cut and wove and stitched into human shape,
in the hearth where ashes stirred
stirs dust.

And now you've changed midwest for Middle East
And Campus Gothic for the Wailing Wall.
They gave you a gun, and bullets for the beast,
Trained you, installed you where the blow will fall.

Between patrols you write, along with dreams
Of sprinklers, 'I see things now in right relief:
The good stands out. You know what nothing means
Until you choose the beauty of belief.'

You've found the truth, guarding a zone of dunes
None but a mule would fight a camel for,
Only a man a man. The wind draws runes
With sand, and rubs them out again with more.

And still I stand my terms before the board,
Erasing mistakes and thinking toward the East
Where you prepare the battles of the Lord
And write me letters full of private peace.

around my ears the sounds rise in slow eddies
high in the center pulse the ridged whistles of crickets
the swish of a few cars lifts midnight blue to the window
now and then your pages rustle to my right
so I think of a goatherd sitting on warm stone
rhythmically brushing his goatskin musette on the stone
the goats are amused but browse and leave his gazing
cicadas above sway chewing the air in the high branches
beside his stone a stream whispers of oceans
so far away there is time for a long sleep down the hills
past stones and goatherds and on through cities
past windows where the whispers rise like blue mists
to mingle with the brushing of page on page till the lady
sleeps and the white sea takes the stream

When you get so old
the face of Lachesis
mingles in your short sight
with the mask of Atropos,
and you don't give much of a damn anyway
who it is snickering in the shadows
grown so attached to you;

when the faces of friends
stream tirelessly through your vision:
some, as through a distorted glass,
the children of themselves --
like early and late editions of yesterday's paper
gone to wrap some rotting thing;

then it's time, and barely,
to remember being sixteen,
a child standing in a field struck blind
temporarily
by the sight of someone you thought was something else,
some piece of you, an emissary.
Her feet were rooted firmly on the hill,
it was nothing like that;
but holding something
that did not shiver like the frantic leaves,
and thoughtlessly commanding the unfocussed sun
to become the shadow of her own
shining, she made herself the sign of an old pact,
a ritual future, your very lens --
Fate, in fact.
Now, half a century later,
caught on your way out
in a mirror in the front hall, recognizing
your own deformity, you think
you should shiver her image with a cry;
strain swearing and red-faced to shatter
with your own voice that dim, lying glass
that says, red-faced, that you believed it.

Go ahead, shout it down; waver away,
upstairs again to mutter in your stuffy room,
too bright and smelling of Vicks and cough syrup:
swear she was a murderess of children.
If you could only see

what happens is not
what is meant to happen,
none of this
was of necessity, nor was she
responsible, only
irresponsible;

turn around. Look again.
Only a man can shape his own shadow.
Over the years
you forgot it all,
as a man who's lost his way
will pretend sometimes
he meant all along to be just
where he is.

Your friends passed on,
died off, leaving
sons who didn't listen
when your voice meandered back to what had been
like a reflected river.

And now, after all, old and seeing again
as at sixteen
only what your mind sees,
you pass over again that early loss of sight
as a thing which is not
to be lost in an old man's eyes.

She beyond all others in deepest dreams comes
back. You shun sleep, lying in darkness, breath held,
hearing that voice over the rustling dry grass
     breathing in darkness.

Walk for miles each day, with a dog to watch, pen
paper, ink, try, focus attention somewhere
else. But Mi, Sol, Re go the notes her voice slips
     into your blind heart.

Once you knew each inch of her body. No more.
Only one thing, caught in your faithful ear, still
lives. Your eyes lie. Even in dreams the face fades.
     Only a singing.

She's your cane these days. When you tap, she tells how
far you've strayed. Tap trees by the road, you hear how
hollow things are. Listen, You'll hear in high limbs
     voices of dry leaves.

Lover to poet lends his art
Of drifting past and past a place,
Learning its flowered face by heart,
Inventing a beloved face.

He lives by glimpses. All his hope
He earns by tedium, walking by
A wall awake with heliotrope,
And learns to love its stone reply.

Should either into either fade
And either win their one delight,
Division gone, both lose their trade,
Caught up in vision, squander sight.

Eyes too adoring to digress
Engross the single sun for hours
Unless the poet's fickleness
Save lovers from the fate of flowers.

He fell and was drowned too far
from where the confrere dinosaurs
basked in their tar-pits
to decompose in peace. He froze
before he could drown, and merely slept
snug in a new block of the pole's building.

And while he slept he became extinct.
He began to wonder, in his glacial way,
being kept so long in nature's antechamber,
whether he was ignored or just forgotten
and by whom. Who was left?
He forgot.

When the little fellows he remembered
as busybodies with stone-chip spears
attacked the ancient ice and laid him bare,
he found himself so exhausted with waiting
as to have forgotten the protocol.

He could not play the old game, stamping about
trumpeting while they pelted him with brickbats;
for who would not, having lived so long
protected from the passions of the sun,
functionless, ill at ease, wish
merely to rise and step again
into the fumbling hands of the sea?

This night growing up
was born an old man.
It grows austere: the gaudy
stuff of desire is left behind,
a peacock adolescence passed.
The muscles of remorse begin
to atrophy as the moon relaxes down.

On the wall the Turner is dead
as a cat's closed eye. The sheets
have lost their fishy glimmer;
they negate our wrapped bodies.
Only the maniac workshop of the clock
still counts.

No world calls beyond the window
in summer voice of car horns
challenging. The grass is black.
Wind whistles in the air conditioner.

Memory, murdered,
comes back to haunt.
The pillow is like a ballistics box.
The air too seems to trace and claim
attempts of light, till only the clock's
green, stiff fingers irradiate the night,
working toward three-owe-one.

The river of her
will not fail into sand
(beside streams in the park
I linger with her).
Let her be so long and the sun
so play in dark eyes.

Heron, eye-bright, taut
to miss nothing and pluck
a jewelled sustenance up
for radiance of
wing: I am three-fourths of a fool,
one part beyond praise.

Her clothing is of
kinds that a dreamed river
would wear, rugged and soft,
absorbing of the
light in its matte darkness except
gleams, glints like quick smiles.

This lady: let her
be prime feather to guide
flight, and I swear fealty.
At sunset I have
limbered my wings, thrown her her glints,
thought hard upon flight.

Out there there is the
austere knowledge of birds --
the land chequered with brown
rivers, men, small earth.
Over this, wide sky, and between
no clouds to blur sight

that searches as to
embrace, kiss what it can't,
the sun's self above
the river that has
its way under the sky, over
dark earth, its bright eye.

At sunset I am
a blue glint in her eye;
the last fish of the day
is glimmering in
depths and commands (sweetly) me down
to my ignorance.

In the heat they wander from room to room
Absently picking up alabaster
Eggs from wooden cups and fingering them
Thoughtfully, without thought. The party is

Ready to break up, only there may be
Rain. They seek idly for shade, or more than
Shade, something else since, though swollen with heat,
Bulging to fart out the idle guests as
They fidget from room to room, the rooms are

Dim with blinds, blinded. Clouds are coming up
And the rain comes down. Much of the dampness
And all of the heat, wilting the eager
Corsages of the ladies, remain. The

Party is ready to break up, but how
Is one to leave in this downpour? Where could
One go anyway, since it is clearly
Too hot for sleep or food, if anything

Is clear. The rain taps as a man's fingers
May drum on a table between crises.
The guests move less and less, having found the
Last equilibrium equidistant
Each from the calories of the others.

Through the window's just-ajarness, threading
Neatly each head by its two ears like a
Pearl, a siren's frenzied grief whirls closer,
Pierces, whirls on down the scale toward silence.

A great argyle sock
tree-hung
for Christmas (stuffed
stiff with blackjacks,
silencers, the long
black toys of death)
in the dappled leaflight
writhes. Maybe
it is wind, moving
the leaves.
                 Master
clown, Pan
troglodytes below
gambols
snuffing a little wind,
watching with half
a happy eye. You
know the story:

Death winds & the wind dies.

He might come out of a cartoon.
Draped in much overcoat
He follows his wife from Christmastime
Aisle to aisle, contending
Against a sea of faces,
Adding to his arms at every counter
Another parcel or two,
None of which alone, it may be,
Weighs a great deal or is very large,
But which have summed a structure constantly more
Precarious, what
With socks for Grandpa, sisters'
Scarves and dresses, aunts' and
Uncles' books and for the
Kids toys of a dozen bizarre
Unmanageable shapes and stuck
In a crevice two new ties
For him. His wife is short and gray
And nicely dressed, her taste
Is good. Her energy's immense.

By accident as I pass I catch
His eye and that moment,
Surely by accident,
The grand disheveled lovingly gathered
Pile shifts by a fraction and all
At once begins to fracture into constituent
Gifts, a Christmas
Cornucopia --

From his gray
Eyes to mine, just as the first
Package speaks its independence flares
A dream: Deep in a forest
In sun of a summer evening, no one
But birds and trees and possums
For audience and maybe God,
A jongleur keeps a dozen toys aloft,
Hoops and hoop-sticks, dolls,
Tops and a shining sword, shattering
The light with brilliance of their tumbling.

When people pass at a double door
they turn (they must turn)
inward toward each other's face,
and meet with foolishness if, linked
like fingers by the two doors' clasp,
they refuse to smile. (For feeling foolish
each resents the other's eyes.)

More: if a wind on one side eases In
and presses in the Out, In's pressing in
helps Out, eases the pressure. This is not
conundrum but choregraphy,
the rhythm of social acts,
the chain gang's grace.

In a meadow far from double doors
a girl dreams among flowers.
The watchers say Who?
Who did she leave the dance with?
Early too, they say.

From mezzanines I've watched long lines
turning in pairs this way, making a chain
of allemande-lefts like a chain of flowers
a girl has woven while she stands,
the circle slipping from her fingers,
broken to a single braid.

Even the weariest, laden with bags
or shrewdness, tricked
into stranger-smiles,
caught up, have gathered from the dance
a grace,
             as flowers
bask in a girl's rapt hands.

The bear's my neighbor
next cave down --
keeps to himself;
allows me the squirrels,
I leave him the trout.
He keeps folks at their distance
for us both.
He's a quiet soul.
Oh, in spring he
roars some at night --
I find his marks
eight foot up the pines.
Come summer,
he settles in,
says nothing more than he's got to say.

Once in a space
we come across each other --
stand still
on our own sides of the juniper,
looking,
nod, go on
about our business.

In autumn, stream
starts freezing up, he
sees his time --
rest of that year
I miss him.
The bear
knows what he knows.

I wanted to laugh when I saw her smiling at him;
pale moon mouth in the same old crescent,
cradling him -- eyes that were
gone already, a green god's-fire
taken on that twisted torch --
lips that opened like a wound to say
she did.
Did he? You bet.

I wanted to laugh when she was
shackled by a finger to that
jackal, who hadn't even stolen her,
surely not from a mad young dog
chuckling masterless in a back pew.

But when her father,
'in the perfect image
of a priest,' pronounced them
one person, I
had to laugh.

               we
called her
Loud but that was
never true she went off to
Nigeria one year & sent us
each a carved
mask two
different but
so much the same & both so very
neat in front with shiny black
paint & red paint & yellow paint on all the
appropriate exaggerated
features & all the
lines between
colors so clear & sharp & both so clichégrotesque like comic-book
demons they hardly seemed

         (till you turned them
         over and saw the rough
         inside would slash
         ribbons in your
         face if you tried them
         on yourself)

custom-made
                   but they were
ours all right.

The sky
was huge, as he had said
it would be. It sat

cleanly on his mountains,
and filled the wild fields
with color.

Because he had said it would be
beautiful, it was.
Or because it was beautiful,

he said it would be.
I was aware of him
behind me, in the house,

and in the fields in front;
and above me in the sky, filling
all things with their own colors.

I wrote in a small book
that he was larger in every way
than myself.

The blue ink
forced me back
to the sky: I froze

when his shadow fell across the page.
He stood beside me on the porch,
looked out on his world

and saw that it was good, and smiled.
That day long I saw looking out,
a guest in his world,

and tried to be easy there;
but the sky only drained me away to a
thin, blue shell.

Another summer: bookcase-building time.
I've made the yellow sawdust rise all day,
Six days it's filled the air and slowed the light
Lapping the coteries of other years.
I've paid a week for space to shelve a year
Of new acquaintances, volumes of friends.

My friends outside this room are like this room's
Forests of books I fell and range to hand:
Here's James, in whom I find unfolded B;
A is a simple soul, I learn from Proust.

Thinking my leisure here would help me learn
More than your winter nights of talk in bars,
Gestures among the leaves on autumn walks,
My friends, I've tried to make you characters
Flat as the leaves of books, like leaves between
The stiff, preserving pages of my books.

I'd rather check my heart to learn the time
Than read my passions' passing from the clock.
It seems that all this dust has closed my eyes.
My friends, I'm taking off the day to clean.

the sludge in water-pipes
the pipes themselves

everything's black inside

cows (till they're drawn & quartered)
are big sacks of darkness
& warm

needles

it was black once, warm & moist
you liked it too well to remember
now that your limbs are clean

once they drew & quartered souls
to extract the blackness
like a fistful of sludge
& cast it away

but the pipes themselves . . .

& it only worked
because they couldn't close them up again

they knew they were right
when they saw the oily smoke
rising into the face of heaven
right about them all, every mother's son
not one mistake

& inside the knife's blade
it was very dark

Noon sets the tips of pines on fire;
trunks' shapes are half-guessed. The goshawk's
claws glint among ragged feathers.
My feet trace out the hurried way.

When the field and its winding path
answer no question, pose nothing,
my stride slows; easy light casts down
the tree behind me till, a shade,
I wind through the branching shadow.
Evening's levelling everything.

When I see the hawk's smooth winging
home, it seems the world lays down arms
forever. (Hunched in the thick grass,
a blind spot swimming in this blind
repose, a mole thrusts through its long
labor, through this short peace of night.)

Light wears thin. I hear doves whistling
in the dark. On the wide field, day
lies down to sleep, a man worn dark,
his own shadow's weary hunter.

There was a time (such songs begin this way)
When every jewel that graced a pocket, each
Pebble and shell, keepsake of thought's delay
Over some bit of world, had a private speech,
The stored-up, light, long story of a day.

But now there greet the fingers, when they reach
Their refuge, in place of something that might relate
The feel of summer, searchings of a beach--
Car, house, and office on a chain, a weight
Of paper, a half-handful of silver speech.

My mother's mother painted her
Perhaps in 1936
At perhaps thirteen
In the tentative light of a White Mountain dream.
The house not shown
Is sold to strangers now.
It might be raked leaves the color of her hair
She watches, flushed.

Her high and silken blouse is the same
Blue-green as the mountains,
A color almost of sea.
In 1936 her eyes,
Half as old as when I met them, half
As old as I am now,
Were dry as leaves,
Bright as the scattered leaves.

My grandmother nearly always painted trees.
In this there are only mountains, things
Keeping their blue distance.

The old lady is dead. Her brush
Made these mountains of a half-known mother's wish
Or set them down as they were by her daughter's eyes
Composed of vague desire and the sea.

She dreams of distance
Hazy and wide as the North Atlantic,
Peopled with strangers;
Holds it still as she holds her blazing
Head for her mother's brush.
Between pale lips she
Breathes the world that invests her
Into being,
Formless,
Perfect:
A woman with my own face,
Thinking of other things.

When the hair is carefully trimmed away
You find in the pig's forefoot a little hole
Through which the legion of devils bow in and out.

Say they enter on a summer morning,
Leaving the marks of their tiny claws as six
Small rings. Then, 'please the pigs,'

As the Saxons say, those trotters flash
In as fiddle a jig as you who listen
Candidly will hear from any warm

Sly singer in the mud: 'Oh the mud is good,
There's plenty of good to be found in slops,
And the best of the good is a beast in shade.

They'll slit my ear and cast me out
Unfit for human consumption. Bub,
I'll follow anyone home who feeds me, yes,

And live to a hundred and five or ten.' Oh trim
The hair from a pig's forefoot; I'll show you why
A poke is best from the inside. And a sty.

The pillows were white and fluffy, 
an effect reminiscent of sitting in sidewalk cafes 
on lower Fifth Avenue, back in the old days, 
or of sipping Mexican Pernod with Irv and Harriet, 
in their cabin high in the Sangre de Cristos. 
The night outside would be cool and black with promise 
of snow and the outhouse a good twenty steps from the back door. 
But, in the old days, lower Fifth Avenue was peaceful, 
even in wartime. The President had an apartment 
in a building on Washington Square, but was never there 
nowadays, according to the doorman, whom I never failed to ask. 
All over the world, people were going to sleep and waking up, 
fluffing their white pillows and going back to sleep again. 

Irv and Harriet's cabin was actually in the Sacramentos, 
the Sangre de Cristos being much farther north in New Mexico. 
But there's something about Sangre de Gisto, the words, 
in Spanish. There's also arena, which means sand. It can also mean 
"arena", which is fair enough when the arena has sand in it. 
But the names of things can fool you at times. 
The Sangre de Gistos aren't in the least bit bloody 
to the naked eye, and presidents' apartments don't always 
have presidents in them. The Red Swan turns out to be 
a woman in disguise. And north of the Sacramentos 
and south of the Sangre de Cristos are the Sandias, 
which are partly sand, but mostly rock.
I have nothing to send you. 
My bowels reek. It has been 
raining here forever. 
The news has been bad for weeks. 
Even the neighbors have only petty 
scandals to whisper about. 
Birds of bright plumage 
are reduced to rags, 
dogs die and rot 
in the gutters. 
What did I do, 
where are you? 

This is in the valley of the Rio Grande. 
You are standing in the hot sun 
at the intersection of two roads -- one 
paved, a yellow line down the middle, 
the other dirt, angling off through the cottonfields. 

There is no one in sight. No birds in the sky. 
You see the tracks made by cars and trucks turning 
off of the dirt road and onto the paved one. You also see 
those made by cars turning onto the dirt road, 
but you cannot distinguish these from those made getting on. 

And then there is a cloud of dust speeding up the valley 
toward you. A cloud of dust moving with no wind. 
And out of the dust cloud emerge six yellow buses 
full of schoolchildren -- Mexican, Indian, Anglo, 
and mixtures of these. Schoolchildren, laughing 

on their way to school. And then there is a seventh, 
in which the children are no longer laughing. It stops 
for you, and you enter.
a strange rain falling 
with its strange burden
and always running 
legs heavy, chest heaving, 
headful of memories, premonitions -- 
                                                         the tall rain 
thrusting down through the dark, death-dealing 

death riding the rays of the sun
thought of small rain, wind from the west, 
sidewalks of cities in those days, shining, 
slippery with light, those lost days 

the big hand clasping my small one, 
how warm it was there!
sunlight didn't matter: the heart 
had its own darkness, as the sky 
beyond blue is black 

                     "Listen, my children, and you 

the backyards were empty, everyone 
moving away from the old block 

                     shall hear of the . . ."
eyes are everywhere, like bits of broken glass, 
watching the high tower for someone about to appear 

& the watchers are being watched
and the blind virgin 
unravels herself 
from the folds 
of a flag 

her body shining 
in the falling rain
String quartets on Sunday afternoon. 
Pittsfield, Massachusetts, nearby. Melville's Pittsfield! 
From which in a car I followed a girl and her mother 
all the way to New Haven, Connecticut. 
After the concert, in a Howard Johnson's, they were eating 
at a nearby table. The girl -- nice legs, 
nice breasts, nice face -- she smiled at me, 
her mother looked away. And I followed them 
-- didn't know if they knew it was me -- all the way 
to New Haven, their very front door. 
How they sped through those small Connecticut towns 
-- got a ticket in one -- surprised 
as hell to see me in their rear-view mirror again 
-- the demon lover at their -- her -- heels. 
The girl saw me pull up across the street, 
smiled, said something to one of her two burly brothers, 
who took one step and I was off for ever. 

Under his chair, his hat 
like a small, tired animal. 
His hands resting on his knees. 
A map of his life on his face. 
Black angels whispering in his ears. 


A somber day. Hardly a bit of sun. 
A woman with bare breasts. At intervals 
there are cats, dancing in the high grass. 
Clouds high overhead, not a solid gray. 
Houses press in on all sides, none 
of the doors or windows open. A widow, 
solitary, sits behind her house, with bare 
breasts, an invisible face, and no sun on it. 

The notes of a song, picked out singly 
on a piano. The hands mistaking. The eyes 
moving among the objects presented to them. 
Picking and choosing. Testing the qualities 
of a certain kind of vision: single, flat, 
unpenetrating. Things are so simple, 
it seems to say. You never know, she says, 
you hardly ever know. Once I was happy. 

The day disintegrates into crashing chords 
and discords, wild intervals of passionate 
meditation. A touching of hands, and the faces 
turn to each other. Lightning leaps 
among the towering clouds. A gusty wind 
springs up, wipes away a world. 
 

Pushing aside 
the thick branches, 
branches thick with 
tender & green leaves, 
pushing aside the green 
tender leaves, moving 
into sunshine, looking 
for, yellow sunshine 
from blue sky, 
sniffing a wet breeze, 
pushing aside the thick 
leaves, moving into 
sunshine, looking for 
berries? 
 

Moving west along the canyon floor 
scruffy mesquite & cottonwoods at river-edge, 
likkered up like all the rest I saw 
her high broad cheekbones ("her friends 
call her La India, but not to her face") 
dug her incongruous, powder-blue eyes 
her "never-to-be-forgotten" smile. 

River running faster now, down toward where
we came from, the desolate east. Who was it 
said she would kill me? I forget now. 
Bunch of stiffs in the next car maybe. 
I said I'd gladly die. Those coppery thighs! 
My moccasined, musky Rose of the West! 

Higher up, the canyon walls pressing in 
ominously, barely room for the tracks and a trickle 
of water. Occasional points of light shining through 
the blue darkness of the closing mountains. Before 
it was complete, we had already come 
to an understanding. 
 

They stood across 
the broad meadow from us, 
their armor gleaming 
in the sun, their horses 
pawing the ground 
and snorting. 
At the sound of the trumpet 
we charged them. Yells 
and shouts filled the air. 
They began to move toward us. 
The field was filled 
with a flurry of flags, 
a clatter of weapons and armor, 
a pounding of hooves and hearts. 
As we reached their lines, 
they broke, fell back 
and melted 
into the trees. 
And before we knew it, 
a gang of them 
were throwing rocks at us 
from the second floor 
of Mr. Simpson's garage. 
Luckily, most of us 
had garbagecan tops 
to use as shields. 
But they 
were throwing rocks! 
And trying 
to hit us, too! 
Stevie Jackson got hit 
in the head 
and began to bleed 
and cry. We started 
to run away, 
but another bunch 
of them were hiding 
in the Simpsons' garden. 
Stevie got hit 
by a stick 
and fell down crying. 
Jake Gibson, Fred 
Martin, the lieutenant, and I 
lobbed several grenades 
into the densest part 
of the foliage 
where the bastards 
were hiding. The radio 
operator called in air support 
before he got a bullet 
in the gut. He screamed 
for twenty minutes and then 
died. The strike 
was quick and clean, 
leaving nothing 
but charred jungle 
in front of us. 
Steve Jackson had a hole 
between his eyes. 
I threw him over my 
shoulder and carried 
him to the chopper. 
We had been friends 
all our lives. 
The chopper lifted, 
and those of us 
who were left 
fanned out 
into the rain. 
By the time I got home, 
I was late for supper, 
and Mother punished 
me for getting wet. 
Stevie Jackson spent 
three weeks in the 
hospital that time. 
 

carried herself well. Her mount, 
while skirting the purple hill, 
broke a leg, and, to its 
everlasting credit 
insisted on 
finishing 
the race 
on three. 


What do you do 
out in the West 
where the proud remnants 
of European aristocracy 
climb down from their phaetons 
in haughty disarray 
and walk, bare-headed, into the desert 
never to be heard from again 
unless it is in some dusty town 
called Drygulch or Sidewinder, 
bypassed by the railroad, 
wells long ago gone dry, 
where they take their parched throats, 
their sun-cracked faces, 
into the only saloon left in town 
and ask the one-eyed barkeep 
for champagne, and are told that 
there's one bottle left 
which he's kept for just 
such an occasion? 


It was late Saturday afternoon. 
By the time she got home 
from the motel, she was 
already desperate.

Epilogue



He lived
his life 
as though it were 
a work of art, surrounded 
though he was by piano students turned bankers. 
His cup of tea
was paradox and conundrum. His lively mind 
thriving on contradiction, infesting it 
with its own inextricable logic. 
Accosting voluptuous young ladies, 
requesting them to divest themselves 
in the face of Historical Necessity 
and the deplorable Social Graces. 
All of this had a numbing effect, giving way to 
an unlikely series of series, the legendary
plumbing, the plumbing was numbing, the shovels
were digging, ideas taking root, another 
round of interminable conundrumming 
coming to an end. 
Then -- ah, then -- to give it all up

His early period laid a firm
foundation for his middle years (sometimes 
known as the Diddle Years) in which he did
liddle or nudding. Noodling around in his
Attic studio, cracking valises, playing chest, 
smoking reflections or pipestems, punishing 
his friends. And his friends
(if you can call them so, for I, I never shall)
his friends came always slinking by to see 
if there was anything new to be catalogued. 
And would look him from toe to head in contempt, 
call him an aging terrible infant 
and slinking slink away.

The end of the so-called Second World War
found him somewhere in Central Europe, wandering 
in a daze in his self-styled garden, thinking
of his good friend Anton, whom he hadn't seen 
since that summer in Munich before the war,
and devoutly wishing that some drunken American 
soldier would come by and put a bullet in his cabeza.

A landscape full of twigs, dirty leaves, and autumnal
splendor. A glowing amber lamp held aloft by the left 
hand of a three-dimensional nude, golden curls lapsing 
onto her shoulder. Her lovely legs are spread 
provocatively before a shimmering waterfall 
and a small pond.

He died 
as he would 
have wanted to.

What we were never aware of was 
that Mary & Jane had run off to Barbados 
where they are living together 
as husband and wife 
we hope they will always be happy 
we were also unaware 
that a first cousin of Mary's 
on her mother's side of the family 
has been confined to an asylum 
for most of her natural life 
& that Jane's father's uncle 
was a self-made millionaire 
who died in poverty on the third day 
of the seventh month of his eightieth year 
he did not rise again insofar as is known 
we are sure that Jane's family 
wouldn't have stood for it 
Mary's family also pretended to gentility 
after the elopement an aunt of hers was heard 
to ask why she had to do it with a Baptist 
 

You fall in love bit by bit, 
piece by piece. First, 
her legs, sleek and nylony, 
cutting along E. 47th St. 
Then a quarter profile 
from the back of the crowd 
at the bus stop. The back of 
her neck, a wisp or two of hair, 
as she pauses at the fare-box. 

Day by day you inch up on her 
in the bus. A glimpse of 
her smile drives you crazy. You catch 
a whiff of her perfume and the next day 
you rub elbows with her. The bus 
lurches to a stop. You feel her breast on 
the back of your arm. This is Friday, 
naturally, so you have the weekend 
to think about it. 

Monday, you make your move. You brush 
her buttocks with your hand. Next, 
a day or two later, you let her know 
she is definitely being felt. A squeeze, 
a goose. The weeks are passing like days. 
She hasn't called a cop. You slowly turn 
her around, look into her eyes. She looks 
feelingly into yours. Days pass like weeks. 
She lifts one of your hands to her breast. 

Soon enough your other hand is at her crotch, 
feeling around. Her thighs are gripping it 
like a vise. Working it around. Her eyes 
have been closed for weeks now. Her breast 
heaving. She's gasping for breath. She's 
ripping your shirt with her nails. 
And when it's all over, 
she slowly opens her eyes. Her hot eyes. 
"You're wonderful, you're wonderful!" she sighs. 

You want to know her name. 
Where she lives. Who she is. 
What she's doing this weekend. 
She puts a finger to your lips. 
"You're wonderful," she breathes. 
Her finger taps your teeth. 
"You were wonderful, dear, 
but don't say a word. 
Let's not spoil it." 
 

They are waiting 
their toes are 
curling in their 
shoes they don't 
make any sound 
but I know they 
are waiting there 
their eyes are 
narrow slits and 
their hands are not 
in their pockets 
they are waiting 
behind doors or 
in alleys I can 
hear their breathing 
if I hold my 
breath 


Her departure 
had been the occasion 
of general consternation. 

Several committees were formed 
to seek ways and means of bringing 
her back. These were called Ways & Means 
Committee #1, Ways & Means Committee #2, Ways 
& Means Committee #3, and so on. 

These committees would meet early in the morning, 
before the sun rose so high that their members would 
be unable to think very clearly, what with the heat and all. 

Most committees found it advisable to divide themselves into 
sub-committees: as, Ways & Means Committee #42, Sub-Committee 
A, Sub-Committee B, and so on. The sub-committees would usually 
meet in the evening on a more informal basis, 
often in a neighborhood bar & grill. 

Mornings, the sub-committees would report back 
to their respective committees, which would then consider 
the merits of their recommendations, separate the wheat 
from the chaff, as it were, and send the wheat 
along to the Central Committee, 
made up of committee chairmen 
and chaired by the King. 

The Central Committee met once a week (but only on Tuesday 
afternoons, so as not to interfere with the King's golf schedule). 
It would discuss the proposals of the various committees 
and invariably decide that none of them were workable. 
Each chairman would defend the suggestions 
of his own committee and attack 
all the others. 

The upshot, of course, was that the King grew more and more furious 
by the week. He was put off his game and developed an almost 
incurable slice. In a rage, he asked his caddy what he should do. 

Send someone to ask her to return, the caddy said. 
The King sent the caddy. The Queen returned. 
To universal applause. 

Moral: If a system works, don't knock it.

Our guide and our bearers have fled. 
The snowfields are blazing. 
At this altitude, the sky is almost black. 

We have attempted the South Face and failed. 
The storm broke our descent. 

Our fingers are frozen. 

The world is white and then black 
and then white again. 

We had no chance for the top. 
 

Your unfortunate situation 
reminds me of a time I was alone 
in a strange city. It was a dark 
and obscure day, as though I had 
brought my own weather. 

Some friends of mine 
were to have met me at the station, 
but seemed to have forgotten all about me. 
So I was obliged to walk. 

My friends, evidently, had moved to another city. 
For three days I tried one address after another, 
climbing stairways, knocking at doors. 
Three nights I slept in a park. 

You are not alone you see. Like you, 
I suffer, thrill at the thought of it. 
 

Someone he knew 
was speaking to him 
from very far away, so far 
he could barely see him. 

They were sitting at an oblong table 
and he was at the other end of it. 
He could see his lips move 
but could not hear what 
he was saying. 

He had been told that he would know him, 
but now that they were face to face 
he wasn't sure he remembered. 
Blue eyes and sandy hair. 
He couldn't be over thirty-five. 

The table was round now, 
and he seemed to be screaming at him. 
He could almost remember where it had been, 
where he had met him. His blue eyes. 
Why was he screaming? 
His sandy hair. 


              "Your self-delusions exact 
              their own price 
              in their own time."

His own last words, 
from the fire. 

A fantastic life! 
A man depraved by vice, 
as they thought. Refined. 
Perverse. 

Unknown to those 
living in his own house. 
Spied upon. Whispered about. 

There was too much rain & then 
there was not enough. Floods 
followed by drought. His 
magic was strong. 

When the crops had failed 
and they were hungry, 
proverbs, folklore, 
and even astrology 
proved small consolation. 

He makes devils, they said. 
He speaks with the dead. 
He eats the unborn. 
 

Night falls heavily through the trees, 
the wet ground holds it. 
In the morning, there will be fresh tracks 
in the wet ground. And no one will know 
who left them there. 
The night is dismal 
and we are afraid of it. 
Morning dawns grayly, and there are 
things that have happened that we 
know nothing about. 

A man's life is like -- well, what? 
The moisture found on early morning grass 
has fallen silently during the night 
and vanishes before noon. 
There is the sudden thrashing of an animal 
in the high grasses and reeds 
at the edge of a scum-covered lake. 

The smile of a woman so beautiful 
that she is confined to a garden 
with walls so high that no one 
can see her, with walls so high 
that no one can see her smile. 

A beautiful afternoon. The trellises were disarranged. 
The palace eunuchs were trepanning the Emperor 
in his very own garden. The power struggle 
appalled all of us who knew of it. We few. 

Nothing from nothing. From nothing comes nothing. 
Nothing comes to nothing. Nothing added to nothing gives you nothing. 
If you have nothing and nothing is taken away, you are left with 
nothing, nothing less than you had to begin with. Nothing from 
nothing. Nothing more, nothing less. 
 

My power is very great against you. My dreams 
have been auspicious for weeks now. My arm 
throbs with strength. My heart pounds strongly 
in pursuit of you. Your name is weak, is weak. 

All signs are favorable to your death. Your death star 
is in the proper quarter. Your life star sinks 
into the sea. A tree bent away from you as you passed. 
Your wife and children were seen moving away from you at the same time. 

Consider my need for your houses, your goods. 
My land cries out to be added to yours. The eyes of your wife 
seek mine. I said your name to the wind, and the wind took it away 
and hurled it down upon the rocks. And the waters covered it. 
 

Walking where water 
never flows and I 
had heard that you 
and I were never yet 
wherever she was singing 
or would sing a stone 
that's under water when 
her flower went awry 
a song her sister knows 
or sometimes said she knew 
 

Beneath the bough -- 
O, melancholy devil 
O, sonofabitch 
I'd like to rip your clothes off 
See you walk naked among the rose petals 
 

The mountains around Cayey are green. 
The walls of my office are green. 
Dark green at the bottom. Light green toward the top. 
My office is on the second floor of a white building. 
The building is one of several white buildings 
arranged in a semi-circle, at the center of which 
are two flag poles, flying the flags of Puerto Rico 
and the United States. 
My office has only one window. 
Until two years ago the buildings and grounds were 
a U.S. Army base known as Henry Barracks. 
Old Army men still think of this place as Henry Barracks. 
The parade ground is now used for track and field events, 
although an R.O.T.C. unit marches there from time to time. 
From the window of my green office 
I can look across the green campus 
and see the green mountains. 
There was a sign upstairs, over the urinals. 
"Don't throw butts in the urinals," it said, 
"and we won't piss in your buttcans." 
This sign was taken down. 
From my window I can watch the students 
walking across the green campus. 
The students can look up and see me watching them. 
They cannot see me when I am sitting at my desk 
or standing well away from the window. 
The mural depicting the Last Supper 
in what was once the mess hall 
and is now the snack bar 
was also taken down. 
My office has only one door. 
It is directly opposite the window. 
Just above the door, the word EXIT is painted 
in red letters three inches high. 
Just outside the back door of the snack bar 
is a small sign that says MESS HALL. 
Some things here have not been changed. 
 

I am sitting on my porch reading. 
Across the street is the city welfare office, 
a woman in red is sweeping the sidewalk. 
Down the street to my right is the municipal hospital. 
People come and go. A Catholic high school 
at the end of the street. The girls in their white 
blouses and blue jumpers pass beneath me. 
To my left, a group of men playing dominoes, 
with loud exclamations in Spanish. 
Somewhere, off in the distance, the Russians 
are madly marching on Finland. 
 

Last night, 
the summer 
wasn't very 
warm, I slept 
with mother, 
my hand 
on her fat 
breast. 

Sometimes 
I wake 
up and feel 
things 
crawling 
on me. 

I always 
think 
of that 
soldier 
leading 
a chicken 
on a string. 
 

I am walking through a field 
of yellow flowers. Under a tree 
in the middle of the field of yellow 
flowers sits an Arab in a white burnoose. 
From the middle of the field of yellow flowers 
my Arab stares at me, advancing toward him 
through a field of yellow flowers. 
 

We were picking our way among bits 
and pieces of debris. I stopped to listen. 
Behind a large rock, a bird was singing. 
By the time it was finished, you had moved out of sight. 
 

Time and again, I watched her 
go up to the door 
                           & return, 
without having entered. 
                                   The spring breeze 
stirring in the garden, ruffling 
the curtains of her bed. 

The curling smoke of our cigarettes 
flattening out near the ceiling. 
Our ambiguous conversations, 
returning always to the same themes 
: mockeries, self-parodies. 

               The fading sunlight, 
               the other side of the door. 
 

Sanderson's glance fell on me. 
One of his eyes was bigger than the other. 

Do you know my name? he said. 
His nose was like a big, red strawberry. 

Sanderson, I said. 
His face was leaning, trying to smile. 

You're right, young man. 
Sanderson is me. 


Reminding me of the beginnings of things -- 

long journeys, early breakfast with the lights 
on in the kitchen, pulling out of the driveway 
just before daybreak, a thermos of hot coffee 
in the glove compartment, my father yawning 
as we drove away 

the first day of my life, the first day 
of the world, moving out of the shadow, the whirl 
of forms, slow spinning of planets and galaxies 

the first damn girl I was old enough to think 
I was in love with, a smile as bright as the sun, 
but before that a shoulder as cold as the depths of space, 
gradual warming after chill 

our man and machinery poised at their border, the sun coming up 
behind us, we could see them beneath us, moving around 
in the shadow, we hit them as the sun hit their eyes 
 

How desperately 
the coffee-colored river 
surged through the streets, 
the town you had abandoned. 
 

Hazy horizons. The sky 
that never stops turning. 
She is lost. 
Wandering in circles 
in the cane-brakes 
by the river, 
where no one will find her. 
She doesn't notice 
the birds turning 
in the air above her 
& the sky above 
their turning, turning. 
 

The flat, blue light is below us. 
Your hands move shamelessly 
on my back & thighs. 
Trees emerge from a velvet background. 
Move this way & that. Something is 
moving between them, among them. 
You are lovely, but what 
are you saying? The words 
make no sense to me.
