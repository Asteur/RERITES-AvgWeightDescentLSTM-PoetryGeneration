 I can’t remember what I remember what I was born to be 
 A country and a river
who could see 
 It was 
 
 I was always a million years 
 And I've lived so far
away 
 Now everything I see 
 Was not a lot of mine 
 
 
 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 
 To The Wish 
 
 
 I was the last step of the day of
an old song 
 
 The silence of the heart

 I am just a medal, you're a hero 
 boredom. Wherever anything,
we will never seen. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Death The soul's job is Meaning 
 
 That is all that
you have left 
 And it is nothing you can do 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 I вроде I chased your vision 
 on a brief lake 
 
 And met, and
then I understood 
 that it was the only thing 
 When I am safe in the air 
 I am just a medal, you're a hero 
 boredom. Wherever anything, we will never seen.
