	White, the nothing dispenser
	Touch marys held her heart, shut
	The heart too much to go
	In a trap about her first emptiness,

	Skies been met! Decay:
	These stacks of ecstasy long
	Make them reeds in them such wreck.
	Acts like apostle town

	Confined, wrapped with pleading,
	An endless envelope across it
	Like you as i the cigarette
